NeuronRain is a new linux kernel fork-off from mainline kernel (presently overlayed on kernel 4.1.5 32 bit and kernel 4.10.3 64 bit) augmented with Machine Learning, Analytics, New system call primitives and Kernel Modules for cloud RPC, Memory and Filesystem. It differs from usual CloudOSes like OpenStack, VMs and containers in following ways:
    (*) Mostly available CloudOSes are application layer deployment/provisioning (YAML etc.,) focussed while NeuronRain is not about deploying applications but to bring the cloud functionality into Linux kernel itself. 
    (*) There are application layer memcache softwares available for bigdata processing.
    (*) There have been some opensource projects for linux kernel on GitHub to provide memcache functionality for kernelspace memory.
    (*) NeuronRain VIRGO32 and VIRGO64 kernels have new system calls and kernel drivers for remote cloning a process, memcache kernel memory and remote file I/O with added advantage of reading analytics variables in kernel.
    (*) Cloud RPCs, Cloud Kernel Memcache and Filesystems are implemented in Linux kernel with kernelspace sockets
    (*) Linux kernel has access to Machine Learnt Analytics(in AsFer) with VIRGO linux kernel_analytics driver
    (*) Assumes already encrypted data for traffic between kernels on different machines.
    (*) Advantages of kernelspace Cloud implementation are: Remote Device Invocation (recently known as Internet of Things), Mobile device clouds, High performance etc.,.
    (*) NeuronRain is not about VM/Containerization but VMs, CloudOSes and Containers can be optionally rewritten by invoking NeuronRain VIRGO systemcalls and drivers - thus NeuronRain Linux kernel is the bottommost layer beneath VMs, Containers, CloudOSes.
    (*) Partially inspired by old Linux Kernel components - Remote Device Invocation and SunRPC
    (*) VIRGO64 kernel based on 4.10.3 mainline kernel, which is 64 bit version of VIRGO32, has lot of stability/panic issues resolved which were random and frequent in VIRGO32.
    (*) NeuronRain repositories are in https://sourceforge.net/u/userid-769929/profile/ (Academic and Research version) and https://github.com/shrinivaasanka (Enterprise version)

Products in NeuronRain Suite (Research and Enterprise):
------------------------------------------------------
AsFer - AstroInfer was initially intended, as the name suggests, for pattern mining of Astronomical Datasets to predict natural weather disasters. It is focussed on mining patterns in texts and strings. It also has implementations of algorithms for analyzing merit of text, PAC learning, Polynomial reconstruction, List coding, Factorization etc., which are later expansions of publications by the author (K.Srinivasan - http://dblp.dagstuhl.de/pers/hd/s/Shrinivaasan:Ka=) after 2012.

USBmd - Wireless data traffic and USB analytics - analyzes internet traffic and USB URB data packets for patterns by AsFer machine learning (e.g Spark log analyis) implementations. It is also a module in VIRGO linux kernel.

VIRGO Linux Kernel - Linux kernel fork-off based on 4.1.5 (32 bit) and 4.10.3 (64 bit) has new system calls and drivers which abstract cloud RPC, kernel memcache and Filesystem. These system calls are kernelspace socket clients to kernelspace listeners modules for RPC,Kernelspace Memory Cacheing and Cloud Filesystems. These new system calls can be invoked by user applications written in languages other than C and C++ also (e.g. Python). Simply put VIRGO is a kernelspace cloud while present cloud OSes concentrate on userspace applications. Applications on VIRGO kernel are transparent to how cloud RPC works in kernel. This pushes down the application layer socket transport to the kernelspace and applications need not invoke any userspace cloud libraries e.g make REST http GET/POST requests by explicitly specifying hosts in URL. Most of the cloud webservice applications use REST for invoking a remote service and response is returned as JSON. This is no longer required in VIRGO linux kernel. Application code is just needed to invoke VIRGO system calls, and kernel internally loadbalances the requests to cloud nodes based on config files. VIRGO system call clients and driver listeners converse in TCP kernelspace sockets. Responses from remote nodes are presently plain texts and can be made as JSON responses optionally. Secure kernel socket families like AF_KTLS are available as separate linux forks. If AF_KTLS is in mainline, all socket families used in VIRGO kernel code can be changed to AF_KTLS from AF_INET and thus security is implicit. VIRGO cloud is defined by config files (virgo_client.conf and virgo_cloud.conf) containing comma separated list of IP addresses in constituent machines of the cloud abstracted from userspace. It also has a kernel_analytics module that reads periodically computed key-value pairs from AsFer and publishes as global symbols within kernel. Any kernel driver including network, I/O, display, paging, scheduler etc., can read these analytics variables and dynamically change kernel behaviour. Good example of userspace cloud library and RPC is gRPC - https://developers.googleblog.com/2015/02/introducing-grpc-new-open-source-http2.html which is a recent cloud RPC standard from Google. There have been debates on RPC versus REST in cloud community. REST is stateless protocol and on a request the server copies its "state" to the remote client. RPC is a remote procedure invocation protocol relying on serialization of objects. Both REST and RPC are implemented on HTTP by industry standard products with some variations in syntaxes of the resource URL endpoints. VIRGO linux kernel does not care about how requests are done i.e REST or RPC but where the requests are done i.e in userspace or kernelspace and prefers kernelspace TCP request-response transport. In this context it differs from traditional REST and RPC based cloud - REST or RPC are userspace wrappers and both internally have to go through TCP, and VIRGO kernel optimizes this TCP bottleneck. Pushing down cloud transport primitives to kernel away from userspace should theoretically be faster because 
	(*) cloud transport is initiated lazy deep into kernel and not in userspace which saves serialization slowdown
	(*) lot of wrapper application layer overheads like HTTP, HTTPS SSL handshakes are replaced by TCP transport layer security (assuming AF_KTLS sockets)
	(*) disk I/O in VIRGO file system system-calls and driver is done in kernelspace closer to disk than userspace - userspace clouds often require file persistence
	(*) repetitive system call invocations in userspace cloud libraries which cause frequent userspace-kernerspace switches are removed.
	(*) best suited for interacting with remote devices than remote servers because direct kernelspace-kernelspace remote device communication is possible with no interleaved switches to userspace. This makes it ideal for IoT.
	(*) VIRGO kernel memcache system-calls and driver facilitate abstraction of kernelspaces of all cloud nodes into single VIRGO kernel addresspace.
	(*) VIRGO clone system-call and driver enable execution of a remote binary or a function in kernelspace i.e kernelspace RPC

KingCobra - This is a VIRGO module and implements message queueing and pub-sub model in kernelspace. This also has a userspace facet for computational economics (Pricing, Electronic money protocol buffer implementation etc.,)

FAQ
---
(*) What is the historic timeline evolution of NeuronRain repositories?

Initial design of a cognitive inference model (uncommitted) was during 2003 though original conceptualization occurred during 1998-99 to design a distributed linux. Coincidentally, an engineering team project done by the author was aligned in this direction - a distributed cloud-like execution system - though based on application layer CORBA (https://sourceforge.net/projects/acadpdrafts/files/Excerpts_Of_PSG_BE_FinalProject_COBRA_done_in_1999.pdf/download). Since 1999, author has worked in various IT companies (https://sourceforge.net/projects/acadpdrafts/files/AllRelievingLetters.pdf/download) and studied further (MSc and an incomplete PhD at CMI/IMSc/IIT,Chennai,India - 2008-2011). It was a later thought to merge machine learning analytics and a distributed linux kernel into a new linux fork-off driven by BigData analytics. Commits into Sourceforge and GitHub repositories are chequered with fulltime Work and Study tenures. Thus it is pretty much parallel charity effort from 2003 alongside mainstream official work. Presently author does not work for any and works fulltime on NeuronRain code commits and related independent academic research only with no monetary benefit accrued. Significant commits have been done from 2013 onwards and include implementations for author's publications done till 2011 and significant expansion of them done after 2012 till present. Initially AstroInfer was intended for pattern mining Astronomical Datasets for weather prediction. In 2015, NeuronRain was replicated in SourceForge and GitHub after a SourceForge outage and since then SourceForge NeuronRain repos have been made specialized for academic research and astronomy while GitHub NeuronRain repos are for production cloud deployments.
 
(*) Why is a new Linux kernel required for cloud? There are Cloud operating systems already.

Because, most commercial cloud operating systems are deployment oriented and cloud functionality is in application layer outside kernel. User has to write the boilerplate application layer RPC code. NeuronRain VIRGO provides system calls and kernel modules which obfuscate and encapsulate the RPC code and inherent analytics ability within linux kernel itself. For example, virgo_clone() , virgo_malloc(), virgo_open() system calls transparently converse with remote cloud nodes with no user knowledge, configured in virgo conf files - this feature is unique in NeuronRain. Application developer (Python/C/C++) has to just invoke the system call from userspace to embark on cloud. This is not possible in present linux distros. Linux and unix system calls do not mostly use kernel sockets in system call kernelspace code and do not have kernel level support for cloud and analytics a void not compensated by even Cloud operating systems like openstack.

(*) How does machine learning and analytics help in kernel?

A lot. NeuronRain analytics can learn key-value pairs which can be read by kernel_analytics kernel module dynamically. Kernel thus is receptive to application layer a feature hitherto unavailable. Earlier OS drove applications - this is reversed by making applications drive kernel behaviour. 

(*) Are there existing examples of machine learning being used in Linux kernel?

Yes. There have been some academic research efforts, though not commercial, to write a machine learning scheduler for linux kernel.Linux kernel presently has Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) which is based on Red-Black Tree insertion and deletion indexed by execution time. It is "fair" in the sense it treats running and sleeping
processes equally. If incoming processes are treated as a streaming dataset, a hypothetical machine learning enabled scheduler could ideally be a "Multilabel Streaming Dataset Classifier" partitioning
the incoming processes in the scheduler queue into "Highest,Higher,High,Normal,Low,Lower,Lowest" priority labels
assigning time slices dynamically according to priority classifier. It is unknown if there is a classifier algorithm for streaming datasets (though there are streaming majority, frequency estimator, distinct elements streaming algorithms). In supervised classification, such algorithm might require some information in the headers of the executables and past history as training data, neural nets for example. Unsupervised classifier for scheduling (i.e scheduler has zero knowledge about the process) requires definition of a distance function between processes - similar processes are clustered around a centroid in Voronoi cells. An example distance function between two processes is defined by representing processes on a feature vector space:
	process1 = <pid1, executabletype1, executablename1, size1, cpu_usage1, memory_usage1, disk_usage1>
	process2 = <pid2, executabletype2, executablename2, size2, cpu_usage2, memory_usage2, disk_usage2>
	distance(process1, process2) = euclidean_distance(process1, process2)

(*) Who can deploy NeuronRain?

Anyone interested in dynamic analytics driven kernel. For example, realtime IoT kernels operating on smart devices, driverless vehicles, robots, drones, embedded systems etc.,.

(*) Is NeuronRain production deployment ready?

Presently complete GitHub and SourceForge repositories for NeuronRain are managed (committed, designed and quality assured) by a single person without any funding (K.Srinivasan - http://sites.google.com/site/kuja27) with no team or commercial entity involved in it. This requires considerable time and effort to write a bug-free code. Though functionalities are tested sufficiently there could be untested code paths. Automated unit testing framework has not been integrated yet. Note of caution: though significant code has gone in both GitHub and Sourceforge repositories there is still a lot to be done in terms of cleaning, documentation, standards, QA etc.,  

(*) How is NeuronRain code licensed? Can it be used commercially? Is technical support available?

All repositories of NeuronRain Sourceforge and GitHub excluding Grafit course materials (https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/Grafit/ which is Creative Commons 4.0 licensed) are GPLv3 copyleft licensed. As per license terms, NeuronRain code has no warranty. Any commercial derivative is subject to clauses of GPLv3 copyleft licensing.

(*) Can NeuronRain be deployed on Mobile processors?

Presently mobile OSes are not supported. But that should not be difficult. Similar to Android which is a linux variant, NeuronRain can be cross-compiled for a mobile architecture.

(*) Are there any realworld usecases for applicability of machine learning in linux kernel?

Yes. Some usecases are described in  https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/Grafit/blob/master/EnterpriseAnalytics_with_NeuronRain.pdf. Apart from these, Pagefault data and on-demand paging reference pattern for each application can be analyzed for unusual behaviour and malware infection. Malware have abnormal address reference patterns than usual applications.
