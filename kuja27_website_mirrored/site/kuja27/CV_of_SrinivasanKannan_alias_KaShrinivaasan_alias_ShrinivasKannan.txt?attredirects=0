3. VIRGO (subsystem of NeuronRain) – VIRtual Generic Os Linux Kernel (compatible with 4.1.5 (32-bit) and 4.13.3 (64-bit) mainline kernels) – Linux Kernel Extensions for cloud - kernel modules, system calls for cloud rather than at application level high up the stack with :
	3.1 		Config file support
	3.2 		Psuedorandom Generator Based Loadbalancer
	3.3 		Kernel space remote execution
	3.4 		User space remote execution with kernel upcall and pthread creation of userspace library function or executable
	3.5 		Example unit test cases
	3.6 		Usermode output redirected logging feature for Kernel upcall to Userspace
	3.7 		Intermodule Function Invocation in Kernel Space - through which any machine on cloud can be completely remote-controlled deep upto board and hardware cards through function names or commands sent through virgo_clone() calls.
        3.8 CPU Pooling Driver and virgo_clone system call – Multi-kernel-threaded VIRGO cloudexec Kernel Driver Module for unrestricted service of virgo_clone or other client requests.
        3.9 Memory Pooling Driver (and a key-value store)  and system calls userspace clients for it on Cloud nodes – virgo_malloc,  virgo_get, virgo_set, virgo_free.
        3.10 Queueing Driver - that implements a wrapper over linux workqueue and also a native local queue - used for KingCobra requests queuing with handler invocation. Also implemented is a standalone kernel queueing service that listens on requests rather than being forwarded by CPU and Memory pooling drivers above.
        3.11 VIRGO Cloud File Systems Driver and system calls - implements  distributed cloud file system calls and telnet userspace clients for  – virgo_open, virgo_close, virgo_read and virgo_write of a file on remote cloud node
        3.12 All the drivers above for CPU, Memory and File System on cloud have 3 paths each for telnet connection to remote driver kernel server socket and system call connection to remote driver kernel server socket – 1) parameter is executable in userspace 2) parameter is a function name which uses a kernel upcall plugin to execute in userspace 3) parameter is a function name executable in kernel space – configured by a boolean flag with in the driver binaries. Based on this flag either kernel upcall to userspace or kernel intermodule invocation is done.
        3.13 A config driver - for exporting config symbols 
        3.14 Experimental Bakery algorithm kernel module implementation – for synchronization in cloud
        3.15 Utilities driver kernel module – a universal kernel module with exported utility function symbols that can be invoked across VIRGO Linux subsystems and Linux kernel including EvenNet logging kernel socket client and skbuff kernel socket debugger.
        3.16 Experimental EventNet driver kernel service module – This listens on incoming EventNet log messages (Vertex and Edge) and writes to EventNet Vertex and Edge text files by VFS write. These files can then be massively processed by the boost::graph or pygraph GraphViz code in AsFer to create DOT files and graphics. Event vertices and edges can be logged by virgo_eventnet_log() utility function from any kernel module on any VIRGO cloud node.
        3.17 From the above EventNet graph, a logical time ordering can be obtained on the cloud events and partakers which is for example useful in establishing money trail in KingCobra MAC eletronic money.
        3.18 Kernel Analytics Kernel Module – reads the config key-value pairs set by AsFer or any other machine learning software and exports them which can be looked-up in any other kernel module. The key-value config are analytics variables learnt by mining kernel or other logs and objects. With this an adaptive dynamic kernel which changes over a period of time depending on a machine learnt config is obtained. At present an Apache Spark usecase which mines kern.log and exports a config variable through kernel_analytics has been implemented.
        3.19 Thus VIRGO has all the requisite minimum functionalities for a linux variant cloud, artificially intelligent, operating system
       3.20      SATURN Program Analysis Module – Intercepts linux build and extracts program analysis data in trees. SATURN logs are analyzable by AsFer (e.g null pointers, aliasing, memory etc.,).
       3.21 	   VIRGO is suitable for analytics driven embedded systems e.g kernelspace IoT
       3.22     VIRGO KTLS config kernel module – only in VIRGO_KTLS branch of VIRGO64 repositories
	3.23     64 bit version of VIRGO Linux kernel based on mainline 4.13.3 kernel (in a separate repository) is in separate repository and has been found to be better performing and stabler than VIRGO 32bit. 
	3.24    VIRGO 64-bit has lot of random panics related resolutions related mostly to i915, CIFS drivers and SMB security. Though functionally similar to 32 bit VIRGO linux, 64 bit kernel is suited for large RAM installations, with CPU level security features and faster than 32 bit binaries. 4.13.3 kernel also supports Kernel Transport Layer Security (KTLS). VIRGO64 repositories implement KTLS setsockopt() in a separate branch – VIRGO_KTLS.
	3.25   Streaming kernel analytics in VIRGO64 – for live reading of stream of analytic variable-value pairs from remote cloud node over network in kernel_analytics module and exporting them as global symbols in local cloud node kernel. Requires a webservice creating a stream of key-value analytics learnt from a dataset. Presently implemented only in VIRGO64

VIRGO enables viewing entire cloud as a single “logical machine” upto hardware level with machine learning support by implementing lowlevel primitives that can be invoked by highlevel cloud OS components viz., OpenStack Neutron. This differentiates from other cloud libraries which are in userspace mostly. AstroInfer together with KernelAnalytics-VIRGO-USBmd-KingCobra make it a Cloud OS kernel with Machine Learning and Analytics abilities. Support for  mobile operating systems in cloud are, among other things, long term goals for VIRGO.

4.  USBmd (subsystem of NeuronRain) - Linux kernel USB device driver module for debugging and network analytics  :
Contains a modified version of Linux kernel mainline USB and USBWWAN broadband modem drivers with debug statements and functions that capture and dump data transfer buffers in kern.logs. These logs are parsed and processed with Apache Spark and other AsFer machine learning algorithms (e.g Streaming Algorithm implementations) to create a debug and traffic analytics for in and out data – a typical software analytics usecase with widespread necessity in anti-cybercrime, anti-theft and anti-virus products:
	4.1 Mainline USB drivers (USBWWAN, USB serial, USB storage) instrumented with debug statements in URB related functions
	4.2 Apache Spark Python MapReduce Log Analyzer for kern.log – extracts patterns in USB requests and wireless LAN traffic. By enabling Kernel Address Sanitizer in linux kernel 4.10.3 64 bit code and Spark ETL, USB related kernel function invocations have been profiled.
	4.3 64-bit version of this driver is in separate repository based on 4.13.3 mainline linux kernel (32-bit version is based on mainline kernel 4.1.5)

5. King Cobra (subsystem of NeuronRain) – Kernelspace Messaging and Computational Economics Software  that includes a new fictitious Electronic Message Currency – Neuro – which depends on Google Protocol Buffer based Cloud Object Move functionality in AsFer. Flow of such a fictional currency on AsFer EventNet implementation (actors in event vertices are buyers/sellers and direction of flow determines buy/sell) can simulate Economic Markets and Pricing. EventNet is thus equivalent to hyperledgering in other cryptocurrencies and can capture money trail.

Implements a minimal kernelspace and userspace messaging framework using VIRGO cpupooling (virgo_clone) and memory pooling drivers that in turn queues the requests into a kernel workqueue. There is also a standalone VIRGO queue kernel service that listens on the requests without dependencies on VIRGO cpupooling and memorypooling drivers to forward the requests. The VIRGO workqueue handler pops the request from workqueue and invokes KingCobra driver's servicerequest exported function and replies to the publisher and optionally disk persists the incoming requests to filesystem through VFS. Differentiator is KingCobra implements a cloud messaging with a decentralized queue with disk persistence and workflow in kernel level so that hardware is easily integrated into cloud:
	5.1 Linux Kernel workqueue based kernelspace pub-sub kernel module - Receives Messages from VIRGO Queuing 
	5.2 Atomic Cloud Move for Neuro (Message As Currency) electronic money is implemented In AsFer in C++ client-server perfect forwarding (overloaded std::move() and std::forward()) 
	5.3 Userspace JMS pub-sub client-server
	5.4 Pricing – CVXPY implementation - Eisenberg-Gale Market Equilibrium Convex Optimization for finding Market Clearing Prices for Goods and Services. Replacing Prices by Perceived Merit translates Market Equilibrium to Intrinsic Merit Versus Perceived Ranking Equilibrium.
	5.5 Disk persistence of Request-Reply queues.
	5.6 64-bit version of this driver is in separate repository based on 4.13.3 mainline linux kernel (32-bit version is based on mainline kernel 4.1.5)
	5.7 Fictitious Neuro currency Buy-Sell transactions are edges in an EventNet Event-Actor Graph implemented in AsFer and can be mined for subgraph patterns – EventNet is thus an economic network

October 2013 – January 2014 – continued work on my opensource products (Krishna iResearch - https://sourceforge.net/users/ka_shrinivaasan) and non-profit machine learning remote consultancy to Clockwork Interviews Pvt Ltd, Chennai (Hiring product - http://piqube.com)  for initial design of a Resume scoring, Named Entity Recognition in Resume using GATE, CRF++, IIT-Bombay CRF, study of Social Network Analysis Tools (SocVnet,SNAP etc.,) and informal mail interactions on my open source products among other things


September 2012 - February 2013 – Parttime Consultancy for Global Analytics(Chennai)  and  Work on my opensource products (Krishna iResearch) 

1. Did the Python AMP workflow implementation as per the workflow specification for AMP using PyUtilib, RabbitMQ and Config files support. Wrote some python scripts for AMP workflow config files support and parsing .
2. Wrote Design spec analyzing workflow alternatives (like PyF, cascade) .
3. Wrote AMP workflow-over-cloud (AMP on Hadoop) specification in addition to AMP workflow spec. 
4. Guided on GDP 2.7.x and 3.0 bug fixes and issues.
5. Helped in debugging GDP 3.0 timeout manager implementation in Feb 2013 which was found to be working.

Apart from the above worked on design and development of my nonprofit open source products- https://sourceforge.net/users/ka_shrinivaasan



January 2011 – March 2011 and July 2011 – August 2012 – Global Analytics(Chennai) – Senior Lead Software Architect (C/C++/Python)

1. Mentored and Managed a team of 3 people . 

2. Released version 2.3.1 of Global Decision Platform(GDP) with fixes for crashes in production environment.

3. Did refactoring, many bug fixes and enhancements to Global Decision Platform(GDP) version 2.5.0 for master demo lead passthroughs to work. 

4. Implemented acceptor-worker thread model request handling in GDP 2.5.0 with single acceptor thread and configurable number of worker threads for Service Execution Manager(SEM) and Service components of GDP. This resulted  in significant improvement in response time. 

5. Designed and implemented session based request-response in GDP 2.5.0

6. Implemented modified timeout error logging with placeholders for errorcodes and request id and did fixes for frequent crashes in production environment for GDP 2.5.0. 

7. Released GDP version 2.5.1 for which 2 minor binaries were developed to clear the queue and test the creation of queues (for System V message queues)

8. Released GDP version 2.7 which has important bug fixes for crashes in python container(needed for AMP runtime described later), few features for graceful shutdown of the SEM, option to reconnect to MySQL during exception in Python container etc., 

9. Redesigned GDP 2.5.0 SEM loadbalancer for GDP 3.0 to route requests to service processes by periodically monitoring the service process load and removing a bottleneck due to wait/notify code. This resulted in 10x speed up of the request-response throughput time.

10. For GDP version 3.0, designed and Implemented a new Session Timeout Manager algorithm to timeout the request session based on user configured timeout value(simplified version of Survival Index Based Transaction Timeout Manager mentioned later).

11. For GDP version 3.0, worked on embedding multiple python interpreters in Service process with Python C API replacing boost::python calls. This involves facility to have a global dictionary across multiple interpreters (or) local dictionary  per request (or) per-thread dictionary for each service worker thread (using thread local storage) and also creation of pool of interpreters from which interpreters are allocated per request and returned to the pool after the request is serviced. This obviated the need for boost::python since boost did not support multiple interpreters with multithreading and interpreter pooling. This involved  fixing one of the most time consuming bug related to restricted mode python in 2.4.3. Since it was deprecated in python 2.7, fixed Python 2.4.3 source to circumvent restricted  mode and also did another fix for the same problem with PyImport_ImportModuleEx()

12. Mentored the team to work on Dynamic Risk Tables (DRT) library of GDP to extend the database compatibility to MySQL and Oracle

13. Was involved in the Automated Modelling Platform(AMP) development to automate the predictive modelling from the production data. Fixed many crashes in python runtime during testing of AMP prototype realtime design. Suggested an alternative design for AMP realtime based on external user address-space message queue, which populates  the in-memory queue from on-disk request log, periodically replenishes it from disk, reads requests from message queue and posts them in parallel to Realtime-subset and Realtime-superset python services, and gives a virtual view of the single physical queue to each queue client(queue clients are located in SEM) – meant to replace an existing queueing module with msgsnd/msgrcv which involves user and kernel address-space copying to remedy huge queue backlog seen in AMP realtime prototype. This tightly couples GDP Python runtime with the AMP runtime 

14. For GDP 3.0, implemented a GDP pluggable queue named GDAMPQ designed for AMP above – Global Decisioning and Automated Modeling Platform Queue which is a simple in-memory queue with optional disk persistence to replace an existing queueing module with msgsnd/msgrcv which involves user and kernel address-space copying. This in-memory queue in best testing circumstances is 30% better than the System V unix message queues.
