NeuronRain - Design Objectives
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NeuronRain OS is machine learning, cloud primitives enriched linux-kernel fork-off with applications in Internet-of-Things. AstroInfer is
the machine learning side of it to learn analytics variables later read as config by linux kernel and any device specific driver.
NeuronRain has been partitioned into components so that effective decoupling is achieved e.g Linux kernel can be realtime OS for realtime less-latency applications, Message Queuing can be KingCobra or any other standard MQ product. There are IOT operating systems like https://github.com/RIOT-OS/. Linux and IoT - linux on cameras,automobiles etc., - https://lwn.net/Articles/596754/. NeuronRain in itself is not just a product but a framework to build products. Applications can invoke VIRGO cloud memory,clone,filesystem primitives to create new products on NeuronRain Smart-IoT framework.

But if it has encoded horo strings for all events then to filter out strings of a particular class of events, classification is needed.

DESIGN NOTES, THEORETICAL INTERLUDES(might have errors), TODO AND NICE TO HAVE FEATURES (list is quite dynamic and might be rewritten depending on feasibility - long-term design goals with no deadline)

(FEATURE - DONE-MDL,Entropy,Edit Distance,Compressed Sensing) 1. Test with Massive Data Sets of encoded strings for pattern mining. Algorithms for Approximate Kolmogorov Complexity or Minimum Description Length (MDL), Shannon Entropy, Levenshtein Edit Distance have been implemented in Python and C++. Compressed Sensing (used in Image and Signal Processing) which "sense" from "compressed" large data - This involves computing a matrix product AX=B where X is an image or bitmap and A is a chosen matrix which together give a sketch B. Sketch of an image bitmap has been implemented.

(FEATURE - THEORY-POC Implementation-DONE) 2. An experimental text compression algorithm that deletes vowels and stores only consonants as far as meaning is not altered. For example "follow" could be stored as "fllw". Since on an average every third letter in an english word is a vowel, approximate compression is 33%. Message is reconstructed using most probable meaningful word for "fllw" (For example "follow" could be more probable than "fellow" or vice versa). This is similar to Texting in phones and to some extent encoding in Match Rating (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_rating_approach). One more example could be "Decision" which can be compressed as "Dcsn". An interesting phonetic aspect of this is that "Decision" is spelt as "Dee-C-shan", or each vowel following a consonant is subsumed or coalesced into the preceding consonant while spelling. Thus "Dcsn" gives 50% compression ratio. PyEnchant python package SpellChecker has suggest() function that returns a tuple of closely related words to a compressed (or "misspelt") word. Conventional WSD algorithms might have to be used on this tuple to get the maximum match. Initial testing reveals that the accuracy with spellcheckers is less and this problem requires a non-trivial algorithm which might require error-correcting codes like Reed-Solomon and Berelekamp-Massey assuming the english text as a finite field of alphabets as elements. Predominantly used dictionary-based Lesk's disambiguation Algorithm can find the intersection between "follow" and the rest of the context and "fellow" and rest of the context and choose the word with maximum intersection with context - this is quite commonsensical too. But the drawback of this disambiguation is that keywords are disambiguated well while other connectives (is, are, thus,  this, who, why etc.,) in the sentences are not. Another limitation of applying WSD while decompressing is lack of meaningful context words at runtime - only compressed words are available and they cannot be used as disambiguating context creating a circular dependency - disambiguation requires decompression and decompression needs disambiguation. For computing maximum likelihood, most probable vowel between 2 consonants can be zeroed in on by a 26*26 table of consonant ordered pairs and having vowels between them as probability distribution priors. This is feasible only if priors are available. For example th-t has (h,t) as consonant pairs and a is most probable vowel than e,i,o and u and th-t is disambiguated as "that". The vowels missing in compressed text can be represented by a single extra bit. This is an alternative to PyEnchant spellcheck suggest() function. This can be Hidden Markov Model also - with missing vowels as hidden states to measure and compressed letters as observations. This requires forward-backward probabilities computation or Viterbi path which gives most likely word for a compressed word. For "th-t" the Markov Model looks like:
			x1--------x2--------x3------x4
			|	  |	    |	    |
			t         h	    -       t	
and Bayesian for the above is:
	Pr(x3/[t,h,-,t]) is directly proportional to Pr(x3/[t,h]) * Pr([t]/x3) 
and to be precise it is:
	Pr(x3/[t,h,-,t] = Pr(x3/[t,h]) * Pr([t]/x3) / Pr(t)/Pr(t,h) with denominator being a pre-computable constant from substring hashtable as below.

Viterbi path would give the most likely path or most likely word for above. 

(2.1) Pr(x3/[t,h]) is computed from dictionary - number of words having the sequence / total number of words
which is the argmax( Pr(a/t,h), Pr(e/t,h), Pr(i/t,h), Pr(o/t,h), Pr(u/t,h)) and priors are computed for the substrings tha, the, thi, tho, thu.

(2.2) Pr(t/x3) is computed from dictionary similar to the previous for argmax of probabilities for substrings at, et, it, ot, ut.

(2.3) If total number words in dictionary is E (could be 200000 to 300000) and yi is the number of words of length i, then y1 + y2 + .... + yn = E .

(2.4) Number of substrings of an n bit word is (n-1)n/2.

(2.5) Thus number of substrings for all words in dictionary is y2 + 3*y3 + 6*y4 + 10*y5 + ... + (n-1)n*yn/2. Thus number of substrings (could be significantly more than 500000) is independent of the text to be decompressed and the substring prior probabilties can be precomputed and stored in a hash table (size of the table is = number of substrings * 5 for each vowel). This table has to be huge but does not depend on text to be decompressed. 

(2.6) Above is theoretical basis only implementation of which needs precomputing the above hashtable. 

(2.7) Above experimental compression scheme that ignores vowels gives a string complexity measure (a minimum description length) similar to Kolmogorov complexity.

(2.8) Algebraically, above can be imagined as a Group Action where group G is set of consonants (with the assumption that inverses exist for each consonant with a special "backspace" element added to alphabet set and identity is "space" element) and set X to act on is the set of vowels. Orbit is the set of X elements moved (g.x) and if concatenation (with phonetic coalition) is a group operator then consonants act on vowel sets. For example, the consonant "t" acts on "o" from vowel set to give the word "to". The concatenation is non-abelian.  Interestingly the above phonetic coalition of vowels to an adjoining consonant is the Stabilizer set or set of Fixed points(g.x=g). For example, the consonant "d" acting on the vowel "e" gives a phonetically coalesced compression "d" ("d" ,"de" and "dee" are phonetically same as "d") as a fixedpoint. Thus Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem ( set of cosets of Fixed points - Quotient group G/G(x) -  isomorphic to Orbit) should apply to the above.  There may be scenarios where a maximum likely vowel from above argmax() computation does not equal the actual vowel expected and for arbitrary non-dictionary strings prior computation is difficult. Thus this algorithm is quite experimental.

(2.9) Linguistic words can be construed as a polynomial graph plotted on an x-y axis: x-axis represents position of a letter in a text and y-axis represents an alphabet (vowels and consonants). From the previous string complexity measure missing vowels are missing points on the polynomial. Disambiguating the word is then equivalent to Polynomial Reconstruction Problem/List Decoding/Error correcting codes (Reference: Point 345) that reconstructs a list of polynomials (i.e set of disambiguated words) from a codeword(i.e compressed vowelless string) one of which disambiguates and decompresses the vowelless codeword - polynomial reconstructed should include (almost all) missing vowels. Text can be represented as a polynomial function defined as f:N->Alphabets where N is set of natural numbers. Factoring over this polynomial ring enables text to be represented as products of texts. An implementation of polynomial encoding of texts has been done in 364. Berlekamp-Welch algorithm creates a system of equations which themselves are evaluations of two polynomials over finite fields for all xi (P(xi) = Q(xi)/E(xi)) where each xi is from input set of ordered pair of points (xi,yi). This system of equations is solved by Gaussian Elimination to compute Q(x)/E(x) = P(x). Berlekamp-Welch encodes a text in a different way than plain polynomial curve fitting - each letter ordinal in text is a coefficient of a polynomial of degree equal to size of text whereas polynomial encoding of text fits a curve passing through the ordinal values of letters in successive positions. This polynomial with ordinal coefficients over a finite field is then evaluated in n points and transmitted. Recipient reconstructs the original polynomial from transmission errors in received points by Gaussian Elimination. If transmission error is simulated as removing vowels in original message polynomials, reconstruction by solving system of equations should almost correctly identify missing vowels.

(2.10) From point 345 and 346, high level language texts like English,French etc., can be thought of as 255-coloring of letter positions where 255 is the size of alphanumeric alphabet (ASCII,Unicode). Each letter in a text "colors" corresponding letter position in text with an alphabet. From Van Der Waerden and other coloring theorems, there are monochromatic arithmetic progressions in letter positions in high level language texts i.e alphabets in APj positions are all same for some APj. This implies there is an order in high level context sensitive natural language grammars and answers in affirmative the conjecture posited in 346.

(2.11) Monochromatic arithmetic progressions in letter positions of natural language texts implies that finite state automata can be learnt to accept such arithmetic progressions in text. For example , text "abaabaabaab..." over alphabets {a,b} has alphabet b in AP positions where AP is 2+3n. Regular language Finite State Automata for this 2-colored infinite string is:
			a---b---a---a--->b
			        |<-------|

(2.12) In terms of vowelless string complexity measure previously, if a 255-colored string is simplified to 2-colored string as "Consonant-Vowel-Consonant-Consonant-Vowel-Consonant-Consonant-Vowel..." replacing consonant and vowels with "Consonant" and "Vowel" notations, english language (and most others) on an average has an arithmetic progression k+3n of vowel positions for some constant k.

(2.13) Previous vowelless string compression can be linguistically explained in terms of sequence of syllables. Related syllable based name clustering of proper nouns occurring in BigData sets has been described in 708 - Strings of Names in english suffer from lack of compound alphabets which most other classical languages are bestowed with. Every syllable in an English name string (when it is spelt out verbally) could contain more than one alphabet which is concatenation of vowels and consonants while in most other natural languages every syllable is mostly associated with just one compound alphabet(vowel + consonant). This makes clustering similar names easier in other languages by comparing syllables (blocks of substrings) instead of alphabets. In previous example word "decision" has blocks of substrings or syllables - "de-ci-sion". Thus distance between two strings could be defined as distance between audio of the words (by recording the syllables of the two words by human speech and comparing the two audios by speech merit measures like MFCC). Text Compression then amounts to succinctly storing the sequences of syllables - an example succinct storage is to transcribe the string from English to another language having compound alphabets and storing the concise syllables in another language. Example string "de-ci-sion" is compressed syllable-wise as "d-c-sn" forfeiting vowels in English while a transcription could benefit from compound alphabets. From 2.8, algebraically each syllable is an Orbit and could be a Stabilizer set too (g.x=g) - e.g d.e=d, c.i=c in previous example string "decision".

(2.14) Variable k-order (n-grams) Markov Model of texts computes prior probabilities of successor substrings to predecessor substrings (of length k) in a text (which has been trivially implemented in NeuronRain by substring probability dictionaries in Hidden Markov Model Maximum Likelihood Estimator) and those priors are bayesian conditional probability training data for predicting next literal in a string, sufficient to decompress vowelless texts by filling in absent vowels approximately. Naive algorithm which does a regular expression match of a vowelless text encoded as DFA within a dictionary corpus,having no assumption on k-order Markov Model or Hidden Markov Model Maximum Likelihood Estimator might have better accuracy than probabilistic methods. In example earlier, vowelless text d-c-s--n for string "decision" is encoded as Regular Expression DFA d[a-z]c[a-z]s[a-z][a-z]n and matched by dictionary search. Downside of dictionary regex match is the exclusion of proper nouns (Names of People and Places) in decompressed text as dictionaries and encyclopaedia may not contain all possible proper nouns acting as an indirect certificate for Named Entity Recognition(NER) of names.

3. (FEATURE - THEORY - Pairwise LCS implementation DONE) KMeans, KNN and other clustering and classification algorithms implemented thus far, group similar encoded strings for astronomical (or any other) data. Clustered strings can further be mined for patterns with ordering by applying a Longest Common Substring algorithm within each cluster. This gives a fine grained pattern hidden in the encoded input strings. These longest common substrings can then be translated to a rule similar to class association rule (Frequent item set and GSP algorithms are quite expensive and do not fit well for mining patterns in strings).

4. (FEATURE - DONE) Implementation of String Distance measure using different distance measures (python-src/StringMatch.py) for comparing Encoded Strings in addition to pairwise and Multiple Sequence Alignment.

5. (FEATURE - DONE) Construct a Hidden Markov Model with State transitions and Observations(events). If the number of states are exponential then this will be infeasible. A HMM has been implemented for text decompression with vowel-removed strings. Also a HMM has been implemented for Part-of-Speech tagging, Named Entity Recognition and Conditional Random Fields.

6. (FEATURE - DONE - continuation of point 3) Correlate with Rules from Classics (BPHS, BJ etc.,) with the mined datasets for particular class of events (Special Case of Mundane Predictive Model is described in items 47 to 51 and basic framework is already implemented). The Longest Common Substring implementation already mines for most common pattern with in a clustered or classified dataset of encoded strings which suffices for astronomical datasets. Script for parsing the clustered data from classifiers and decoding the longest common pattern have been added.

7. (FEATURE - DONE) Integrate Classifiers in above String Pattern mining (classify strings and then mine).

8. (FEATURE - DONE) At present fundamental algorithms like - Perceptrons with Gradient Descent, Linear and Logistic Regression, Hidden Markov Model for Text Decompression, KMeans Clustering, Naive Bayesian, Decision Tree, SVM (uses thirdparty OSS) and kNN Classifiers, String Alignment and Distance based algorithms, Knuth-Morris-Pratt String Match Algorithm, Sequence Mining, Deep Learning(Convolution and Backpropagation), Social Network Analysis, Sentiment Analysis - have been implemented specialized for the encoded strings astronomical datasets.

[Disclaimer and Caveat: Due to radical conclusions that are derivable from the P(good) binomial coefficients summation infinite series when applied to majority voting with SAT setting in perfect zero-error case, all the related points elsewhere in this document on majority voting + SAT versus psuedorandom choice (e.g 100% noise stability and circuit lowerbounds for it) are work-in-progress , unreviewed (excluding those done during 2009-2011) , not-quite rigorous drafts only with possible theoretical errors, which might have commissions-omissions and more additions to make as mentioned earlier and this analyzes a very special case of voting scenario. It is not an attempt to prove or disprove P=NP,but rather an analysis of very generic unnatural proof framework based on boolean social choice complexity for proving lowerbounds which might include the question of P=NP. Infact it shrouds entire complexity classes underneath it. It is non-conventional and questionable as to whether LHS pseudorandomness or dictator boolean function can be equated to RHS Majority Voting. This just analyzes the special case when there is zero-error or same-error on both sides and the outcomes of processeses related to pseudorandom/dictator choice and Majority Voting with Voter SAT oracles are "equally good" where "Goodness" is defined as for all scenarios which could be infinite, a PRG/Dictator choice or Majority Voted Choice "make zero-error decisions". It is not a statistical mean on both sides in which all probabilities are averaged. More specifically, (in)tractability of perfect voting is pivotal to this - assuming perfection which does away with BP* complexity classes this poses itself as a strong non-trivial counterexample. In theoretical interludes in this document probability of perfection is defined as a function of NoiseSensitivity or NoiseStability which is based on commonsense notion that if an entity (human or software) has "correct thinking in decision making" outcome "decision" is "correct". For example if noisy inputs do not perturb a voter's boolean function, voter is 100% stable. This is equivalent to real life scenarios where conflicting inputs from people make a person to decide incorrectly. A perfect voter is never swayed. Even without equating the 2 sides(e.g whether there exists a P algorithm for RHS PH or EXP circuit) above are non-trivial problems. Lot of assumptions have been made in arriving at conclusions in this document, most important being equal stability implies circuit lowerbounds which is based on a matrix of scenarios where error and noise intersect and 100% noise stability regime in percolation crossing events. In general setting, distribution is Poisson binomial with unequal voter error and Error is not just limited to noise sensitivity but also includes flawed decision tree evaluation which adds one more scenario to matrix. It is more apt to say there are no conclusions arrived at from equating LHS and RHS of Pr(Good) circuits. Rather it raises lot of more open questions and contradictions. A major requirement for proving a separation or containment is that RHS majority voting circuit has to be a complete problem for class C whether exact or probabilistic(BP*), implying whole L(RHS) is in L(LHS) because LHS is an algorithm for a complete problem. For many probabilistic BP* and PH classes no complete problems are known. Conclusions can be drawn subject to knowledge of complete problems for RHS majority voting circuit.

10. (THEORY) https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/ImplicationRandomGraphConvexHullsAndPerfectVoterProblem_2014-01-11.pdf?attredirects=0&d=1 on decidability of existence of perfect voter and the probability series for a good choice of https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/CircuitForComputingErrorProbabilityOfMajorityVoting_2014.pdf?attredirects=0&d=1 are related to already well studied problems in social choice theory but problem definition is completely different. Arrow's theorem of social choice for an irrational outcome in condorcet election of more than 2 candidates and its complexity theory fourier analysis proof [GilKalai] are described in www.cs.cmu.edu/~odonnell/papers/analysis-survey.pdf. Irrational outcome is a paradox where the society is "confused" or "ranks circularly" in choice of a candidate in multipartisan condorcet voting. Rational outcome converges to 91.2% (Guilbaud number) with a possibility of 8.8% irrational outcome.

11.(THEORY) What is perplexing is the fact that this seems to contravene guarantee of unique restricted partitions described based on money changing problem and lattices in https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/SchurTheoremMCPAndDistinctPartitions_2014-04-17.pdf?attredirects=0 and https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/IntegerPartitionAndHashFunctions_2014.pdf?attredirects=0&d=1 which are also for elections in multipartisan setting (if condorcet election is done). Probably a "rational outcome" is different from "good choice" where rationality implies without any paradoxes in ranking alone without giving too much weightage to the "goodness" of a choice by the elector. Actual real-life elections are not condorcet elections where NAE tuples are generated. It is not a conflict between Arrow's theorem as finding atleast 1 denumerant in multipartisan voting partition is NP-complete (as it looks) - which can be proved by ILP as in point 20 of https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/IntegerPartitionAndHashFunctions_2014.pdf?attredirects=0&d=1 - the assumption is that candidates are not ranked; they are voted independently in a secret ballot by electors and they can be more than 3. The elector just chooses a candidate and votes without giving any ordered ranking for the candidates which makes it non-condorcet. 

12.(THEORY) Moreover Arrow's theorem for 3 candidate condorcet election implies a non-zero probability of error in voting which by itself prohibits a perfect voting system. If generalized to any election and any number of candidates it could be an evidence in favour of P != NP by proving that perfect voter does not exist and using democracy Maj+SAT circuits and P(Good) probability series convergence (As described in handwritten notes and drafts http://sourceforge.net/projects/acadpdrafts/files/ImplicationGraphsPGoodEquationAndPNotEqualToNPQuestion_excerpts.pdf/download, https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/ImplicationRandomGraphConvexHullsAndPerfectVoterProblem_2014-01-11.pdf?attredirects=0&d=1, https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/LowerBoundsForMajorityVotingPseudorandomChoice.pdf?attredirects=0, https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/CircuitForComputingErrorProbabilityOfMajorityVoting_2014.pdf?attredirects=0&d=1 and https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/PhilosophicalAnalysisOfDemocracyCircuitAndPRGChoice_2014-03-26.pdf?attredirects=0). 

13.(THEORY) But it is not known that if Arrow's theorem can be generalized for infinite number of candidates as above and whether such an electoral system is decidable. The possibility of a circular ranking in 3-condorcet election implies that there are some scenarios where voter can err though not exactly an error in making a "good choice" (or Perfect Voter Problem is decidable in case of 3 candidates condorcet election).

14.(THEORY) Each Voter has a k-SAT circuit which is input to Majority circuit. k-SAT can be reduced to 3-SAT (not 2-SAT) and thus is NP-complete. Error by a Voter SAT circuit implies that voter votes 0 instead of 1 and 1 instead of 0. This is nothing but the sensitivity of the voter boolean function i.e number of erroneous variable assignments by the voter that change the per-voter decision input to the Majority circuit. Thus more the sensitivity or number of bits to be flipped to change the voter decision, less the probability of error by the voter. If sensitivity is denoted by s, 1/q is probability that a single bit is flipped and probability of error by the voter is p then p = 1/q^s which is derived by the conditional probability that Pr[m bits are flipped] = Pr[m-th bit is flipped/(m-1) bits already flipped]*Pr[(m-1) bits are flipped] = 1/q*1/q^(m-1) = 1/q^m (and m=s) . This expression for p  can be substituted in the Probability series defined in https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/CircuitForComputingErrorProbabilityOfMajorityVoting_2014.pdf?attredirects=0&d=1. Probability of single bit flip is 1/q if the number of variables across all clauses is q and each variable is flipped independent of the other. Error by voter can also be simulated with probabilisitc truth tables(or) probabilistic CNFs.

For example, a term in the binomial summation becomes:
mC(n+1) * (1/q^s)^(n+1) * (1-1/q^s)^(m-n-1) where m is total number of voter SATs and (1/q) is probability of single variable flip in Voter SAT and s is sensitivity of Voter SAT boolean function - s can change for each voter SAT in which case it has to be s1,s2,s3,s4,s5,... and the summation requires hypergeometric algorithms.

The Voter SAT circuit has an interesting application of Hastad's Switching Lemma - random probabilistic setting of variables known as "restrictions" decreases the decision tree depth significantly , or, number of variables that determine the Voter SAT outcome reduces significantly - in other words, random "restricted convincing" of a voter SAT CNF has huge impact on number of variables yet to be "convinced".

As done in the Switching Lemma proof, parity circuit can be an AND of ORs (or OR of ANDs) which is randomly restricted to switch the connectives in lowest 2 levels to arrive at super-polynomial lowerbound for parity and hence for each voter SAT. Thus the Parity CNF can be the special case of Voter SAT also (i.e voter wants odd number of variables to be satisfied - odd voter indeed). This kind of extends switching lemma to an infinite majority with parity oracle case.

Fourier expansion of the unbounded fan-in Majority+SAT circuit is obtained from indicator polynomial (http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/?p=207) by substituting fourier polynomial for each voter SAT in the majority circuit fourier polynomial. Conjecturally, this expansion might give an infinite summation of multilinear monomials - has some similarities to permanent computation if represented as an infinite matrix i.e Permanent converges to 1 for this infinite matrix for perfect voting (?) and Permanent is #P complete. This is obvious corollary of Toda's theorem in a special case when RHS of P(Good) is a PH=DC circuit because Toda's theorem implies that any PH problem is contained in P^#P(P with access to #P number_of_sats oracle). Permanent computes bipartite matchings - non-overlapping edges between two disjoint vertex sets - probably pointing to the bipartisan majority voting. This makes sense if the entire electorate is viewed as a complete social network graph and voting is performed on this network electorate. Majority voting divides the social network into two disjoint sets (for and against) with edges among them - division is by maximum matching - "for" voter vertex matched with "against" voter vertex. When this matching is perfect, election is tied. Imperfect matchings result in a clear winner vertex set - which has atleast one unmatched vertex is the winner.

Demarcation of linear and exponential sized ciruits: P(good) RHS has Circuit SAT for each voter with unbounded fanin.
1) If the variables for each voter SAT are same, then the circuit size is exponential in number of variables - DC-uniform
2) else if the variables are different for each SAT, then the circuit is linear in number of variables - polynomial size

1) is more likely than 2) if lot of variables among voters are common.

There are three possibilities
Circuit lies between 1) and 2) - some variables are common across voters - kind of super-polynomial and sub-exponential 
Circuit is 1) - all variables are common across voters - the worst case exponential (or even ackermann function?)
Circuit is 2) - there are no common variables

As an alternative formulation, LHS of the P(Good) series can be a dictator boolean function (property testing algorithms like BLR, NAE tuples - http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/?p=1153) that always depends on only one variable and not on a Pseudorandom generator. Thus how error-free is the assignment to LHS dictator boolean function determines P(Good) LHS(sensitivity and probabilistic truth tables are the measures applicable as described previously). Thus both LHS and RHS can be boolean functions with corresponding circuits constructible for them.

Influence of a variable i in a boolean function is Probability[f(x) != f(x with i-th bit flipped)]. For Majority function influence is ~ 1/sqrt(n) from Berry-Esseen Central Limit Theorem - sum of probability distributions of values assigned to boolean random variables converge to Gaussian. Thus in infinite majority a voter is insignificant.  Error in majority voting can be better defined with Stability and Noise Sensitivity measures of a Boolean Function (Influence, Stability, Noise, Majority is Stablest theorem etc., - www.cs.cmu.edu/~odonnell/papers/analysis-survey.pdf) where correlated pairs of boolean variable tuples form an inner product to get the expression : Noise(f) = 1/2 - 1/2*Stability(f) where Noise is the measure of corruption in votes polled while Stability is the resilience of votes polled to corruption so that outcome is not altered. [But for infinite majority inner product could become infinite and the measures may lose relevance]. Also related is the Kahn-Kalai-Linial Theorem for corrupted voting - http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/?p=1484 - that derives a lower bound for the maximum influence (log(n)/n). Applications of Noise Sensitivity in real-world elections is described in - https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2009/03/06/noise-sensitivity-lecture-and-tales/ , http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~odonnell/slides/mist.pps and percolation in http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/schramm/memorial/spectrumTalk.pdf?tduid=(332400bcf8f14700b3a2167cd09a7aa9)(256380)(2459594)(TnL5HPStwNw-SliT5K_PKao3NElOXgvFug)() 


As done for sensitivity previously, a term in the P(Good) binomial summation becomes:
mC(n+1) * product_of_n+1_(NoiseSensitivityOfVoterSAT(i)) * product_of_m-n-1_(1-NoiseSensitivityOfVoterSAT(i)) where m is total number of voter SATs and the summation requires hypergeometric algorithms. Infact it makes sense to have Stability as a zero-error measure i.e the binomial summation term can be written as mC(n+1) * product_of_n+1_(NoiseSensitivityOfVoterSAT(i)) * product_of_m-n-1_(1/2+1/2*StabilityOfVoterSAT(i)) since 1-NoiseSensitivity = 1/2 + 1/2*Stability. Difference between sensitivity and NoiseSensitivity here is that NoiseSensitivity and Stability are probabilities and not number of bits and are directly substitutable in P(Good) series. 

Summation of binomial coefficients in RHS is the collective stability or noise in the infinite majority circuit. It converges to 0.5 if NoiseStability is uniform 0.5 for all Voter SATs and in best case converges to 1. This summation connects analysis, non-uniform infinite majority voting and complexity theory - Hypergeometric functions, Noise and Stability of Voter Boolean functions, Majority Circuit.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
P(Good) summation is Complementary Cumulative Binomial Distribution Function (or) Survival Function
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Goodness Probability of an elected choice is derived in https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/CircuitForComputingErrorProbabilityOfMajorityVoting_2014.pdf . For an above average good choice (i.e a choice which is more than 50% good) atleast majority populace must have made a good decision (this is axiomatically assumed without proof where all voters have equal weightages). In probability notation this is Pr(X > n/2) where X is the binomial random variable denoting the number of electorate who have made a good choice which has to be atleast halfway mark. For each Pr(X=k) the binomial distribution mass function is nCk(p)^k(1-p)^k [Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution]. Cumulative distributive function is defined as Pr(X <= k) = summation_0_k(nCk(p)^k(1-p)^(n-k)) and its complement is Pr(X > k) = 1 - Pr(X <= k) mentioned as Complementary Cumulative Distributive Function [Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function] which is also known as Survival Function[Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_function].

A plausible proof for the assumption that for an above average good choice atleast half of the popluation must have made a good decision:
If there are n inputs to the Majority circuits, the voter inputs with good decision can be termed as "Noiseless" and voter inputs with bad decisions can be termed as "Noisy" in Noise Sensitivity parlance. For infinite majority it is known that(from http://analysisofbooleanfunctions.org/):
	lim  NS(delta, Majority(n))  = 1/pi * arccos(1-2*delta) (due to Central Limit Theorem and Sheppard's Formula)
	n->infinity
	n odd

where delta is probability of noise and hence bad decision. If delta is assumed to be 0.5 for each voter (each voter is likely to err with probability 0.5) then above limit becomes:
	1/pi * arccos(1-1) = 1/pi * pi/2 = 1/2 which is the Noise (Goodness or Badness) of the majority circuit as a whole.
From this expected number of bad decision voters can be deduced as E(x) = x*p(x) = 0.5 * n = n/2 (halfway mark)

Above is infact a simpler proof for P(Good) without any binomial summation series for delta=0.5. In other words the number of bad decisions are reverse engineered. But P(Good) binomial summation (complementary cumulative distributive function) is very much required in the hardest problem where each voter has a judging function to produce an input to Majority function and each such judging function is of varied complexities and noise stabilities.

For delta=0.5, NoiseSensitivity of infinite majority=0.5 and both are equal. For other values of delta this is not the case. For example interesting anomalies below surface:

delta=0.3333...:
----------------
NS = 1/pi * arccos(1 - 2*0.333...) = 0.3918

delta=0.25:
----------
NS = 1/pi * arccos(1-2*0.25) = 0.333...

--------------------------
Chernoff upper tail bound
--------------------------
Upper bound for P(Good) binomial distribution can be derived from Chernoff bound (assuming Central Limit Theorem applies to sum of Binomial random variables)- http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jfc/cs174/lecs/lec10/lec10.pdf - For P(Good) series the upper tail bound is needed i.e. Pr(Number of voters making good decision > n/2) which is derivable to 0.5 and 1 exactly wherein the upper bound is not necessary. But for other cases , upper tail Chernoff bound is:
	P[X > (1+delta)*mean] < {e^delta/(1+delta)^(1+delta)}^mean
	Total population is n, mean=n*p and (1+delta)*mean = n/2
	Thus delta = (1 - 2*p)/2*p
	P[X > n/2] < {e^[(1-2p)/p]/(1/2p)^(1/2p)} = {e^(1-2p)n * (2p)^(1/2p)}

When p=0.5 , P[ X > n/2] < 1 which is an upperbound for 0.5.
But intriguingly for p=1 the upper tail bound is:
		(e^(-1)*sqrt(2))^n	
which is increasingly less than 1 for high values of n whereas P(good) converges to 1 in exact case (why are these different?). This contradiction arises since in exact derivation of P[X > n]:
    mC(n+1)(p)^(n+1)(1-p)^(m-n-1) + mC(n+2)(p)^(n+2)(1-p)^(m-n-2) + ... + mCm (p)^m (1-p)^(m-m) 
all the terms vanish by zero multiplication except mCm (p)^m (1-p)^m which becomes:
	mCm*1*0^0 
and by convention, 0^0 = 1, thereby converging to 1 while the Chernoff upper tail bound decreases with n.

--------------------------
Hoeffding upper tail bound
--------------------------
For Bernoulli trials involving binomial distribution summation, Hoeffding Inequality can be applied for upper tail bound - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoeffding%27s_inequality - defined by:
        P(X > (p+epsilon)n) <= exp(-2*epsilon^2 * n)

If p+epsilon = 0.5 for halfway mark, epsilon = 1/2 -p.
P(X > n/2) <= exp(-2(0.5-p)^2*n)
For p=1, P(X > n/2) <= exp(-n/2) which for infinite n converges to 1.

Thus tailbounds above are only less tight estimates and exact summation is better for p=0.5 and 1. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are two independent aspects to the P(Good) series - Goodness and Hardness:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Goodness of Voting:
The convergence of the binomial coefficient summation series in RHS is the "goodness" side of the voting expressed in terms of Noise sensitivity and Stability of each Voter's Boolean Function - whether the voters have exercised their franchise prudently to elect a "good" choice. If the Voter Boolean Functions are all balanced then by Kahn-Kalai-Linial lowerbound there are n/log(n) influential variables that control the decision of each Voter.
(2) Hardness of Voting:
The circuit for RHS(e.g Boolean Function Composition) and its Fourier polynomial expansion.

Mix of Hardness and Goodness result in variety of BP* classes or P* classes (if error is unbounded). Goodness is related to Noise Sensitivity and Stability. Probabilistic Hardness is due to pseudorandomness. Are Goodness and Pseudorandomness related? Yes, because Noise Sensitivity occurs when there is a correlation between two strings with flips. Correlation inturn occurs when flips are pseudorandom. Connection between Stability, Fourier coefficients and pseudorandom flip probability are expressed in (16) and (20) below (Plancherel's theorem).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(*IMPORTANT*) Noise Stability, Noise Sensitivity and Complexity Class BPP (error in voting)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In all points in this document, an assumption is made that Noise Stability and BPP are equivalent notions. Is this valid? A language L is in BPP if for x in L there exists a Turing Machine that accepts x and outputs 1 with bounded probability (e.g 2/3) and if x not in L, rejects x and outputs 0 with bounded probability (e.g 1/3). Following table illustrates all possible scenarios and where BPP and Noise Stability fill-in (x/e is correlated, flipped version of x):
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	x				|    f(x) = f(x/e)	|	f(x) != f(x/e) Noise    |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x in L, x/e in L			|	No error	|	Error		        |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x in L, x/e not in L			|       Error		|   No error if f(x)=1,f(x/e)=0 |
					|			|   else Error			|
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x not in L, x/e in L			|       Error		|   No error if f(x)=0,f(x/e)=1 |
					|			|   else Error			|
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x not in L, x/e not in L		|       No error	|      Error			|
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Third column of the table relates Noise Sensitivity and BPP - it subdivides the Noise Sensitivity into 4 probable scenarios. Hence Noise Sensitivity overlaps BPP - explains one half of the error. Even after a circuit is denoisified i.e third column is removed, it can still be in BPP due to the second column possibilities above. Noise sensitivity handles only half the possibilities in the above table for output noise. The second and third rows in second column represent noise in input where the circuit doesn't distinguish inputs correctly (false positives and false negatives). This requires derandomization. Thus error-free decision making depends on both denoisification and derandomization. A Turing machine that computes all 8 possibilities in the table above without error is 100% perfect decision maker. In terms of probability:
	Probability of Good Decision = Input noise stability (second column) + Output noise stability (third column)
which can also be stated as:
	Probability of Good Decision = 1-(Probability of False positives + Probability of False negatives)

Above is a better ,rather ideal, error probability measure that can be substituted in P(Good) RHS binomial distribution summation because it accounts for all possible scenarios of errors. Presently, P(Good) binomial summation depends only on output noise sensitivity. Complexity literature doesn't yet appear to have the theoretical notion of input noise counterpart of output noise sensitivity for boolean functions(e.g what is the fourier theoretic estimation of false positivity similar to the Plancherel version of noise stability?). Second column input noise can be written as TotalError-[f(x) != f(x/e)] where TotalError<=1. Probability of Good Decision is sum of conditional probabilities of these 8 possibilities in the table:
	Probability of Good Decision = Pr(f(x)=f(x/e) / x in L, x/e in L)*Pr(x in L, x/e in L) +
				       Pr(f(x)!=f(x/e) / x in L, x/e in L)*Pr(x in L, x/e in L) +
					...
				       Pr(f(x)!=f(x/e) / x not in L, x/e not in L)*Pr(x not in L, x/e not in L)
Computation of the above conditional probability summation further confounds the estimation of voter decision error in Judge Boolean Functions.

In other words, a precise estimate of voter or voting error from table above which related BP* complexity class and Boolean Noise Sensitivity:
	Probability of Bad Decision =  NoiseSensitivity - {Pr(f(x)=1, f(x/e)=0)/x in L, x/e not in L}
							- {Pr(f(x)=0, f(x/e)=1)/x not in L, x/e in L}
							+ {Pr(f(x)=f(x/e))/x in L, x/e not in L}
							+ {Pr(f(x)=f(x/e))/x not in L, x/e in L}
which may be more or less than NoiseSensitivity depending on cancellation of other conditional probability terms. This is the error term that
has to be substituted for each voter decision making error. Because of this delta, NoiseSensitivity (and NoiseStability) mentioned everywhere in this document in P(Good) binomial summation and majority voting circuit is indeed NoiseSensitivity (and NoiseStability) (+ or -) delta. Previous probability coalesces Noise and Error into one expressible quantity - i.e denoisification + derandomization.

When Probability of Bad Decision is 0 across the board for all voters, the Pr(Good) series converges to 100% and previous identity can be equated to zero and NoiseSensity is derived as:
	NoiseSensitivity = {Pr(f(x)=1, f(x/e)=0)/x in L, x/e not in L}
                           {Pr(f(x)=0, f(x/e)=1)/x not in L, x/e in L}
                           - {Pr(f(x)=f(x/e))/x in L, x/e not in L}
                           - {Pr(f(x)=f(x/e))/x not in L, x/e in L}

Above matrix of 8 scenarios and identity above give somewhat a counterintuitive and startling possibility that NoiseSensitivity of a voter's decision boolean function can be non-zero despite the convergence of Pr(Good) Majority Voting binomial series when some error terms do not cancel out in previous expression. This implies that there are fringe, rarest of rare cases where voting can be perfect despite flawed decision boolean functions.

Hastad Switching Lemma, P(Good) Majority Voting circuit and Election Approximation or Forecasting
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hastad Switching Lemma for circuit of width w and size s with probability of random restriction p for each variable states the inequality:
   Pr[DecisionTree(f/restricted) > k ] <= (constant*p*w)^k 
where p is a function of width w and p is proportional to 1/w. In forecasting, a sample of voters and their boolean functions are necessary. If the Majority circuit is PH=DC(variables are common across voters) or AC(variables are not so common across voters), the sampling algorithm pseudorandomly chooses a subset from first layer of the circuit's fanin and applies random restriction to those Voters' Boolean Circuits which abides by above inequality. The rationale is that probability of obtaining required decision tree depth decreases exponentially (RHS mantissa < 1). Thus the forecast is a 3-phase process:
(1) Pseudorandomly choose subset of Voter Boolean Functions in the first layer of the circuit - This is also a random restriction
(2) Randomly Restrict variables in each boolean circuit to get decision trees of required depth if voters reveal their blackbox boolean functions
(3) Simulated Voting (and a property testing) on the restricted boolean functions subset accuracy of which is a conditional probability function of (1) and (2). This could be repetitive random restrictions of (2) also.

(1) and (2) are random restrictions happening in 2 different layers of the circuit - amongst voters and amongst variables for each voter .

Alternatively if subset of voters reveal their votes (1 or 0) in opinion polls then the above becomes a Learning Theory problem (e.g. PAC learning, Learning Juntas or oligarchy of variables that dominate) - how to learn the boolean function of the voters who reveal their votes in a secret ballot and extrapolate them to all voters. This is opposite of (1),(2),(3) and the most likely scenario as voters hold back their decision making algorithms usually.  From Linial-Mansour-Nisan theorem , class of boolean functions of n variables with depth-d can be learnt in O(n^O(logn^d)) with 1/poly(n) error. From Hastad Switching Lemma, Parseval spectrum theorem (sum of squares of fourier coefficients) and LMN theorem , for a random restriction r, the fourier spectrum is e-concentrated upto degree 3k/r where k is the decision tree depth of the restriction. For a function g that approximates the above majority+SAT voting circuit f, the distance function measures the accuracy of approximation. 

An interesting parallel to election approximation is to sample fourier spectrum of boolean functions of a complexity class C for each voter.(This seems to be an open problem - http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/17431/the-complexity-of-sampling-approximately-the-fourier-transform-of-a-boolean-fu) . Essentially this implies complexity of approximating a voter's boolean function in complexity class C by sampling the fourier coefficients of its spectrum and hence election forecasting is C-Fourier-Sampling-Hard.

Points (53.1) and (53.2) define a Judge Boolean Function with TQBF example that is PSPACE-complete. Each voter in RHS of P(Good) has such a TQBF that is input to Majority circuit. TQBF is also AP-hard where AP is the set of all languages recognized by an alternating turing machine (ATM) with alternating forall and thereexists states, and it is known that PSPACE=AP (http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~salil/cs221/spring10/lec6.pdf).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(*IMPORTANT*) Boolean Function Composition (BFC) and Majority+SAT voting circuit
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boolean Function Composition is described in detail at [AvishayTal] Section 2.3 - http://eccc.hpi-web.de/report/2012/163/ - which is defined as f*g = f(g(x)) and the sensitivity and complexity measures of BFC are upperbounded by products of corresponding measures. Majority Voting circuit for P(Good) Binomial summation can be formulated as composition of two functions - Majority and SAT i.e Voters' SAT outputs are input to Majority (or) Majority*SAT = Majority(SAT1, SAT2,...,SATn). Hence sensitivity of this composition is upperbounded by sensitivity(MAJn)*max(sensitivity(SATi))  which becomes the "sensitivity of complete electorate" . This has a direct bearing on the error probability of voter decision in P(Good) binomial summation - the psuedorandom choice error probability or dictator boolean function sensitivity in LHS and electorate sensitivity obtained from previous composition in RHS should be equal in which scenario LHS achieves what RHS does (or) there is a PH or EXP collapse to P. Circumeventing this collapse implies that these two sensitivity measures cannot be equal and either Dictator/PRG choice or Majority Voting is better over the other  - a crucial deduction. Dictator boolean function has a sensitivity measure n (all variables need to be flipped in worst case as function depends on only one variable) while the Majority*SAT composition is a maximum of products of 2 sensitivities. Counterintuitively, RHS electorate sensitivity can be larger than LHS as there is no SAT composition in Dictator boolean function. But the convergence of P(Good) binomial coefficient series to 1 when p=1 does not rule out the possibility of these two sensitivity measures being equal and when it happens the Stability is 1 and NoiseSensitivity is 0 on both sides (assumption: NoiseSensitivity for LHS and most importantly RHS are computable and have same product closure properties under composition like other sensitivity measures).


[
Quoting Corollary 6.2 in http://eccc.hpi-web.de/report/2012/163/ for inclusions of complexity measures:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Noise Sensitivity and Probability of Goodness in P(Good) LHS and RHS - Elaboration on previous
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LHS of P(Good):
--------------
(1) Depends either on a natural (psuedo)random process or a Dictator Boolean Function that unilaterally decides outcome.

(2) When error is zero, probability of good decision is 1 (or) Pr(f(x) != f(y)) is zero where x and y are correlated bit strings obtained by
a bit flip. In other words Noise in input does not alter outcome. If NS is Noise Sensitivity, probability of good outcome is 1-NS which is 1/2 + 1/2*Stability. 

RHS of P(Good):
---------------
(1) Depends on the Noise Sensitivity of Boolean Function Composition - Maj(n)*SAT - Majn(SAT1, SAT2,....,SATn).

(2) When error is zero, probability of good decision is 1 because nCn*(1)^n*(1-1)^(0) becomes 1 in summation and all other terms vanish. If each individual voter has different probability of good decision (which is most likely in real world elections) then it becomes Poisson Probability Distribution trial. Throughout this document, only Binomial Distribution is assumed and therefore NoiseStability of voters are assumed to be equal though the individual voter boolean functions might differ. In a generic setting each voter can have arbitrary decision function which need not be restricted to boolean functions. Throughout this document, only boolean voter judging functions are assumed.

(3) NoiseSensitivity is a fitting measure for voter error or voting error as it estimates the probability of how a randomly changed input distorts outcome of an election. Randomly changed input could be wrong assignment by voter, wrong recording by the voting process etc.,

(4) Perfect Voter has a SAT or Boolean Function that is completely resilient to correlation i.e Pr(f(x) != f(y)) = 0. The open question is: is it possible to find or learn such a Voter Boolean Function. 

(5) Brute Force exponential algorithm to find perfect voter is by property testing:
   - For 2^n bit strings find correlation pairs with random flips - 2^n * (2^n - 1) such pairs are possible.
   - Test Pr(f(x) != f(y))
   - This is not a learning algorithm.

(6) For perfect voter, probability p of good decision is 1-NS or 1/2+1/2*Stability and has to be 1 which makes NS=0 and Stability=1.

(7) Open Question: Is there a learning algorithm that outputs a Perfect Voter Decision Boolean Function f such that NS=Pr(f(x) != f(y)) = 0 for all correlated pairs x,y? (Or) Can LHS and RHS of P(Good) be learnt with NS=0 and Stability=1.Such a function is not influenced by any voting or voter errors. Majority is Stablest theorem implies that Majority function is the most stable of all boolean functions with least noise, but still it does not make it zero noise for perfect stability.

Is there some other function stabler than stablest - answer has to be no - But there is an open "Majority is the Least Stable" conjecture which asserts "yes" by [Benjamini-Kalai-Schramm]:
For Linear Threshold Functions (majority, weighted majority et al) f, Stability(f) >= Stability(Majn). 
Majority is Stablest theorem is for small-influence LTFs (maximum influence of f < epsilon). If existence of perfect voter boolean function is proved it would be a generalization of this conjecture. 

An obvious corollary is that for stablest voting boolean function, majority is apt choice (or) in the Majority voting circuit each voter has a majority as voter boolean function i.e it is a boolean function composition of Majority*Majority = Maj(Maj1,Maj2,Maj3,...,Majn). This composition of Maj*Maj is the stablest with least noise. This is also depth-2 recursive majority function mentioned in [RyanODonnell] - definition 2.6 in http://analysisofbooleanfunctions.org/  and Majority Voting with constituencies in https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/IndepthAnalysisOfVariantOfMajorityVotingwithZFAOC_2014.pdf. Also the 2-phase document merit algorithm in http://www.nist.gov/tac/publications/2010/participant.papers/CMI_IIT.proceedings.pdf is a variant of this. A voter with Majority as boolean function trivially decides i.e if more than half of his/her variables are satisfied, outputs 1 without any fancy decision making or judging boolean function circuit (e.g an EXP-complete adversarial simulation). By far this is the stablest possible voting scheme unless [Benjamini-Kalai-Schramm] conjecture is true or there exists a 100% noise stable percolation boolean function - derived in (17) and (18) below.

(8) Theorem 2.45 in http://analysisofbooleanfunctions.org/ is important which proves Stability and NoiseSensitivity for infinite majority:
    lt (n->infinity, n odd) Stability[Majn] = 2/pi*arcsin(rho) 
    (or)
    lt (n->infinity, n odd) NS[delta,Majn] = 2/pi*delta + O(delta^1.5) where delta is the probability of correlation - flipping x to y. 

(9) There are two random variables f(x)=f(y) and f(x) != f(y) with respective probabilities.

(10) This implies for infinite electorate, error probability is (an error that causes x to become y with probability delta): 
    lt (n->infinity, n odd) NS[delta,Majn] = 2/pi*delta + O(delta^1.5) where delta is the probability of correlation - flipping x to y. 

(11) probability of good outcome = p = 1-NS:
    p = 1 - lt (n->infinity, n odd) NS[delta,Majn] = 1 - 2/pi*delta - O(delta^1.5). 

(12) If delta = 1:
    lt (n->infinity, n odd) NS[delta,Majn] = 2/pi + O(1). 
    (and)
    probability of good outcome = 1-NS = 1/2+1/2*Stability = 1-2/pi-O(1).

(13) In P(Good) RHS:
--------------------
If the error probability of voter is 0 and probability of good decision is 1 then binomial summation becomes nCn*(p)^n*(1-p)^n = 1 and all other terms are zero. From (11) p can be 1 only if delta is 0 or no correlation flips exist. This proves the obvious because commonsensically votes are perfect iff there is no wrongdoing.

(14) In P(Good) LHS:
-------------------
If error probability of dictator boolean function is 0 and p=1 then:
 p = 1 - NS(DictatorFunction)
   = 1 - delta^n
Similar to RHS p=1 iff delta=0 
Thus if there is no Noise on either side LHS=RHS (or) LHS is a P algorithm to RHS EXP or PH=DC. This depends on existence of perfect voter function defined in (7). This just gives a counterexample when LHS can be as efficient as RHS and viceversa.

(15) [Benjamini-Kalai-Schramm] theorem states the condition for a boolean function to be noise sensitive:
A boolean function is noise sensitive if and only if L2 norm (sum of squares) of influences of variables in f tends to zero.
Therefore, for stability any voter boolean function in P(Good) RHS should not have the L2 norm of influences to tend to zero.

(16) "How much increasing sets are positively correlated" by [Talagrand] - http://boolean-analysis.blogspot.in/2007/03/how-much-are-increasing-sets-positively.html - defines the inequality (Chang's Level-1 inequality):
	Weight(f) = sum_1_to_n(fouriercoeff(i)) <= O(mean^2*1/log(mean)) 
where Weight of boolean function f in n variables is the sum of squares of n fourier coefficients and mean is Pr(f(x)=1)-(Pr(f(x)=-1). This is alternatively defined as derivative of stability of f wrt rho at rho=0. This measure intuitively quantifies how Pr(f(x)=f(y)) changes as x becomes increasingly correlated with y (due to random flips). Related to this, point (20) is derived from Plancherel's theorem which equates E(f(x)g(x)) to summation(f_fourier(x)g_fourier(y)). But stability is E(f(x)f(y/x-correlated)). The noise operator E(f(y)) is introduced for each monomial in fourier series by which E(monomial(S)) = (rho^|S|*fourier_f(S)). E(f(y)) is thus equivalent to a new boolean function g(x) for which Plancherel formula can be applied - E(f(x)E(f(y))) = summation(rho^|S|*fourier_f(S)^2) = Noise stability. First derivative of Stability wrt rho at rho=0 is Weight(f) - in other words this connects pseudorandomness with stability of a boolean function in terms of fourier coefficients.

(17) By Majority is Stablest Theorem if P(Good) RHS is a boolean function composition of Maj*Maj=Majn(Maj1,Maj2,...,Majn) then its stability is derived as:
   (1-2/pi * arccos(rho))*(1-2/pi * arccos(rho)) assuming that stability of the composition is the product like other measures
If the LHS of P(Good) is the Dictator Boolean Function its stability is (rho)^n (because all bits have to be flipped). By equating the two stability measures both sides following expression results:
   [cos(pi/2*(1-(rho)^n))]^2 = rho

For rho=0:
---------
 [cos (pi/2*(1-0^n))]^2 = 0 hence LHS=RHS

For rho=1:
---------
 [cos (pi/2*(1-1^n))]^2 = 1 hence LHS=RHS

But for rho=0.5:
---------------
 arccos 1/sqrt(2) =  pi/2*(1-0.5^n)
 n = log(1-2/pi*0.7071)/log(0.5)
 n = 0.863499276 which is quite meaningless probably hinting that for uniform distribution the parity size n is < 1. 

(18) In RHS the P(Good) binomial coefficient summation in terms of Noise Sensitivities of each Voter SAT:
nC0(1-NS)^0(NS)^n + nC1(1-NS)^1(NS)^(n-1) + nC2(1-NS)^2(NS)^(n-2) + ...
Above summation should ideally converge to holistic Noise Sensitivity of the Boolean Function Composition of Maj*Maj described previously for stablest voting:
       1/2 + 1/2*(1-2/pi*arccos(rho))^2 = nC0(1-NS)^0(NS)^n + nC1(1-NS)^1(NS)^(n-1) + nC2(1-NS)^2(NS)^(n-2) + ...

If each voter has boolean function with varied Noise Sensitivities, above becomes a Poisson Trial instead of Bernoulli. Above is a closed form for the goodness of voting expressed as the binomial coefficient summation which otherwise requires hypergeometric algorithms because for NS=a/b (!=0.5) summation becomes (nC0*(b-a)^0a^n + nC1(b-a)^1(a)^(n-1) + nC2(b-a)^2(a)^(n-2) + ...)/b^n and closed form is non-trivial as summation is asymmetric whereas the case with NS=1/2 is symmetric with all coefficients being plain vanilla binomial coefficients. Previous identity equates Noise Sensitivity of Majority Voting Circuit in two versions: Boolean Function Composition and Majority with Oracle Voter SAT inputs.

(19) There are classes of boolean functions based on percolation crossings ( http://arxiv.org/pdf/1102.5761.pdf - Noise Sensitivity of Boolean Functions and Percolation) which decide if the paths (left-to-right) in a percolation random graph in which edges are created with a probability p, have a left-right crossing. Perturbed paths are analogous to correlated bit strings. [Russo-Seymour-Welsh] theorem states that the percolation crossing boolean functions are non-degenerate i.e function depends on all variables (quite intuitive as to find out a left-right crossing entire path has to be analyzed). Noise Stability Regime of the crossing events [page 68] answers the following question on noise stability of crossing events:

For epsilon=o(1/n^2*alpha4), Pr[fn(sequence)=fn(sequence with epsilon perturbation)] tends to zero at infinity where alpha4 is the four-arm crossing event probability (paths cross at a point on the percolation random graph creating four arms to the boundary from that point). In terms of fourier expansion coefficients this is: summation(fourier_coeff(S)^2) tending to zero, |S| > n^2*alpha4. [Open question: Is such a percolation crossing the perfect voting boolean function required in (7) and does it prove BKS Majority is least stable conjecture? But this happens only when there are infinite number of Z^2 grid cells - n * n is infinite]. If this is the only available perfect boolean function with 100% stability, [Benjamini-Kalai-Schramm] conjecture is true and both LHS and RHS use only percolation as judge boolean functions(in compositions for each voter - Majority * Percolation), then LHS=RHS by P(Good) binomial summation convergence and LHS is class C algorithm for RHS PH-complete or EXP-complete algorithm where C is the hardness of LHS pseudorandom choice judge boolean function. Also noise probability epsilon=o(1/n^2*alpha4) can have arbitrarily any value <= 1 depending on n and alpha4.

Open question: If Percolation Boolean Functions are 100% noise stable (as in infinite grid previously), what is the lowerbound of such boolean functions (or) how hard and in what complexity class C should they be. This infinite version of percolation is a non-uniform polynomial circuit class (grid has n^2 coordinates).

(*IMPORTANT* - this requires lot of reviewing - if correct places a theoretical limit on when stability occurs) From Plancherel's theorem and stability relation mentioned in (16), summation(rho^|S|*fourier_f(S)^2) = Noise stability. When stability is 1, this summation is equal to 1. In other words rho^|S1|*fourier_f(S1)^2 + rho^|S2|*fourier_f(S2)^2 + ...+ - 1 = 0 which is a univariate polynomial in rho as variable with n roots and degree n. Polynomial Identity Testing algorithms are required to ensure that this polynomial is non-zero (coefficients are non zero). The real, positive, roots of this polynomial are the probabilities where a boolean function is resilient to noise and 100% stable. It non-constructively shows existence of such stable boolean functions. [Talagrand] proved existence of a random CNF with noise sensitivity > Omega(1) - described in http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~odonnell/papers/thesis.pdf. Noise stability depends on huge [S] as evidenced by stability = summation(rho^|S|*fourier_coeff(f(S))^2). What this implies is that for any boolean function, 100% stability is attainable at only n points in [0,1]. In other words there is no boolean function which is 100% noise stable for all points of rho in [0,1]. It also implies that BKS majority is least stable conjecture is true at these points of rho. Since coefficients of this polynomial are Fourier coefficients of the boolean function, roots of this polynomial i.e stability points are functions of Fourier coefficients.

(20) Noise stability in terms of Fourier coefficient weights is defined as:
	summation( rho^k * W^k ) for all degree-k weights where W = summation(fourier_coeff(S)^2) for all |S|, S in [n]

(21) Variant 1 of Percolation as a Judge boolean function is defined in 53.4 below which is in non-uniform NC1. If this is 100% noise stable judge boolean function for LHS and RHS noise stability also converges to 100%, then there is a non-uniform NC1 circuit for RHS PH-complete or EXP-complete DC uniform circuit. This gives a non-uniform algorithm for an RHS uniform circuit. Variant 2 of Percolation in 53.5 as Judge boolean function is also in non-uniform NC1 subject to 100% noise stability condition. In 53.6 a sorting network based circuit is described for Percolation boolean function.

(22) Also from Theorem 5.17 - [RyanODonnell] - http://analysisofbooleanfunctions.org/ - for any rho in [0,1], Stability of Infinite Majority is bounded as:
	2/pi*arcsin ρ ≤ Stabρ[Majn] ≤ 2/pi*arcsin ρ + O(1/(sqrt(1-rho^2)*sqrt(n))).

(23) Peres' Theorem rephrases above bound for NoiseStability in terms of NoiseSensitivity for class of uniform noise stable linear threshold functions f (which includes Majority):
	NoiseSensitivityδ[f] ≤ O(sqrt(δ))

(24) From http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.03398.pdf: [Boppana-Linial-Mansour-Nisan] theorem states that influence of a boolean function f of size S and depth d is:
	Inf(f) = O((logS)^d-1)

(25) [Benjamini-Kalai-Schramm] Conjecture (different from Majority is least stable BKS conjecture which is still open) is the converse of above that states:
Every monotone boolean function f can be epsilon (e) approximated by a circuit of depth d and of size exp((K(e)*Inf(f))^1/(d−1)) for some constant K(e). This conjecture was disproved by [ODonnell-Wimmer] and strengthened in http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.03398.pdf.

(26) Class of uniform noise stable LTFs in (23) are quite apt for Voter Boolean Functions in the absence of 100% noise stable functions, which place an upperlimit on decision error. Depth hierarchy theorem in http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.03398.pdf separates on what fraction, 2 circuits of varying depths agree in outputs.

14.13 (*IMPORTANT*) Connections between Hypergeometric series and Riemann Zeta Function :
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/aa/aa82/aa8221.pdf - This relation implies that:
      - P(good) binomial coefficient infinite series summation (and hence the Psuedorandom Vs Majority Voting circuit) which require Hypergeometric functions 
      - and Complement Function circuit special case for RZF (and hence the Euler-Fourier polynomial for Riemann Zeta Function circuit) 
are deeply intertwined. Kummer theorem gives the p-adic number (power of a prime that divides an integer) for dividing a binomial coefficient which relates prime powers in Euler product RZF notation and Binomial coefficients in Majority voting summation. 

Above implies that binomial coefficients can be written in terms of prime powers and vice-versa: P(good) series can be written as function of sum of prime powers and Euler Product for RZF can be written in terms of binomial coefficients. Also Euler-Fourier polynomial obtained for complement function circuit (Expansion of http://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.4102v1.pdf described in 10) can be equated to binomial coefficient summation. If these two apparently unrelated problems of Complexity-Theoretic Majority voting and Analytic-Number-Theoretic Riemann Zeta Function are related then complexity lowerbound for some computational problems might hinge on Riemann Zeta Function - for example PH=DC circuit problems .

14.15 ACC circuits and P(Good) RHS circuit
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACC circuits are AC circuits augmented with mod(m) gates. i.e output 1 iff sum(xi) is divisible by m. It is known that NEXP is not computable in ACC0 - http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ryanw/acc-lbs.pdf [RyanWilliams]. From (129) above the P(good) RHS can be an EXP circuit if the boolean functions of the voters are of unrestricted depth. Thus open question is: can RHS of P(Good) which is deterministic EXP, be computed in ACC0. [RyanWilliams] has two theorems. Second theorem looks applicable to P(Good) RHS circuit i.e "E^NP, the class of languages recognized in 2^O(n) time with an NP oracle, doesn’t have non-uniform ACC circuits of 2^n^o(1) size". Boolean functions are the NP oracles for this P(Good) Majority Voting EXP circuit if the variables are common across voters. Applying this theorem places strong super-exponential lowerbound on the size of the P(Good) majority voting circuit.

Erdos discrepancy problem which questions existence of integers k,d, and C in sequence of {+1,-1} such that sum_0_to_k(x(i*d)) > C and has been proved for C=infinite - [TerenceTao] - http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05363. For spacing d=1, Erdos Discrepancy Problem reduces to Infinite Majority and as C is proved to be infinite, it looks like an alternative proof of non-decrementality condition in Infinite version of May's Theorem.

19. (FEATURE - DONE-PAC Learnt Boolean Conjunction) Implement prototypical PAC learning of Boolean Functions from dataset. Complement Boolean Function construction described in http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.4102 is in a way an example of PAC learnt Boolean Function - it is rather C Learnt (Correct Learning) because there is no probability or approximation. Complement Boolean Function can be PAC learnt (with upperbounded error) as follows:
	19.1 There are two datasets - dataset1 of size 2^n of consecutive integers and dataset2 of first n-bit prime numbers of size 2^n
	19.2 Each element of dataset1 is mapped to i-th bit of the corresponding prime number element in the dataset2. Boolean Conjunction is learnt for each of the i mappings.
	19.3 Above step gives i probabilistic, approximate, correct learnt boolean conjunctions for each bit of all the prime numbers. 
	19.4 Reference: PAC Learning - http://www.cis.temple.edu/~giorgio/cis587/readings/pac.html 
	19.5 PAC Learnt Boolean Conjunction is an approximated Decision Tree.
	19.6 PAC learning is based on Occam's Razor (no unnecessary variables)

20. (FEATURE - DONE) Integrate AstroInfer to VIRGO-KingCobra-USBmd Platform which makes it an Approximately Intelligent Cloud Operating System Framework - a Cloud OS that "learns" ,"decides" from datasets and "drives" using AstroInfer code. AsFer+USBmd+VIRGO+KingCobra integrated cloud platform with machine learning features together have been christened as "Krishna iResearch Intelligent Cloud Platform" or "NeuronRain". It has to be mentioned here that NeuronRain cloud differs from traditional cloud in following ways:
	20.1 Usual cloud platforms support only application-application layer RPCs over an existing operating system.
	20.2 NeuronRain differs in that aspect by adding new cloud features (with advanced features in development) like RPC, distributed kernel memory and network filesystem related system call clients and kernel modules kernelsocket-server-listeners into linux kernel (a fork-off in that respect)
	20.3 Cloud support within kernelspace has lot of advantages - low network latency because of kernelspace-kernelspace cloud communication by kernel sockets, userspace to kernelspace communication (a userspace application like telnet can connect to a kernel socket listener of a VIRGO driver in kernelspace), userspace-userspace communication by kernel upcalls to userspace from kernelspace.
	20.4 Kernelspace-Kernelspace communication is a privileged mode privy to kernel alone and userspace applications shouldn't be able to access kernelspace socket data.
	20.5 At present the data sent over kernel sockets is not encrypted which requires OpenSSL in kernel. Kernel doesn't have OpenSSL support presently and it is not straightforward to implement SSL handshake in NeuronRain cloud. But there are MD5 and other hashing libraries (e.g crypto) available for encrypting data before before they are sent over cloud.
	20.6 There are ongoing efforts to provide Transport Layer Security (TLS) in kernel sockets which are not yet mainline. Hopefully kernel sockets in future kernel mainline versions would support AF_KTLS sockets and thus NeuronRain cloud implicitly is TLSed :
		20.6.1 KTLS - [DaveWatson - Facebook] - https://lwn.net/Articles/666509/ and https://github.com/ktls/af_ktls
		20.6.2 IPSec for kernel sockets - [SowminiVaradhan - Oracle] - http://www.netdevconf.org/1.1/proceedings/slides/varadhan-securing-tunneled-kenel-tcp-udp-sockets.pdf
	20.7 Usual userspace-userspace network communication has following routing - user1----kernel1----kernel2----user2 for two cloud nodes node1 and node2. NeuronRain cloud communication has following routings - user1----kernel1---kernel2, kernel1---kernel2, user1---kernel1--kernel2--user2. With VFS filesystem API in kernel, both userspace and kernelspace mode communication can be persisted in filesystem and better than an equivalent application layer persistence mechanisms which require lot of internal kernel calls for disk writes. Thus kernel-kernel communication saves lot of user layer to kernel disk write invocations.

22. (FEATURE - DONE-Minimum Implementation) Period Three theorem (www.its.caltech.edu/~matilde/LiYorke.pdf) which is one of the earliest results in Chaotic NonLinear Systems, implies any data that has a periodicity of 3 can have larger periods. Fractals, Mandelbrot-Julia Sets have modelled natural phenomena. Thus finding if a data has periodicity or Chaos and if it has sensitive dependence on initial conditions (for example logistic equations similar to x(n+1) = kx(n)(1-x(n))) is a way to mine numerical data. Computation of Hausdorff-Besicovitch Dimension can be implemented to get Fractal Dimension of an uncountable set (this has to be visualized as a fractal curve than set of points).

(THEORY) DECIDABILITY OF EXISTENCE AND CONSTRUCTION OF COMPLEMENT OF A FUNCTION (important draft additions to http://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.4102v1.pdf - quite experimental, non-conventional and not necessarily correct)
===========================================================================================================================================

(*)24. (DONE) COMPLEMENT OF A FUNCTION - Approximating or Interpolating with a Polynomial: This is quite expensive and is undecidable for infinite sets. Better alternative is to approximate with Spline interpolant polynomials, for example, cubic splines which have less approximation error. (On a related note, algorithms described by the author (that is, myself) in http://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.4102v1.pdf for construction of a complement of a function are also in a way eliciting pattern in numerical data. The polynomial interpolation algorithm for complement finding can be improved with Spline interpolants which reduce the error and Discrete Fourier Transform in addition to Fourier series for the boolean expression. Adding this as a note here since TeX file for this arXiv submission got mysteriously deleted and the PDF in arXiv has to be updated somehow later.). A test python script written in 2011 while at CMI for implementing the above is at: http://sourceforge.net/p/asfer/code/HEAD/tree/python-src/complement.py. Also Trigonometric Polynomial Interpolation which is a special case of Polynomial interpolation, has following relation to DFT X(i)s:
	p(t) = 1/N [X0 + X1*e^(2*pi*i*t) + ... upto XN] and 
	p(n/N) = xn
Thus DFT amd interpolation coincide in the above.

1274. Theorems on prime number generating polynomials - special case is to generate all primes or integral complement of xy=z - related to 24
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Legendre - There is no rational algebraic function which always gives primes.
Goldbach - No polynomial with integer coefficients can give primes for all integer values
Jones-Sato-Wada-Wiens - Polynomial of degree 25 in 26 variables whose values are exactly primes exists

Polynomial interpolation and Fourier expansion of the boolean function in http://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.4102v1.pdf probably would have non-integral coefficients due to the above.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1275. Circuit construction for the complement function boolean DNF constructed in http://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.4102v1.pdf - related to 24
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The DNF constructed for complement function has to be minimized (through some lowerbound techniques) before it is represented as a circuit because the number of clauses could be exponential. The circuit minimization problem has been shown to be NP-complete(unpublished proof by Masek, [GareyJohnson]). The above complement function boolean DNF would yield a constant depth 2 circuit (probably after minimization also) with unbounded fanin. If the size of the circuit is polynomial it is in AC (=NC). The size of the circuit depends on the boolean DNF constructed above which inturn depends on input complement set. Thus circuit depends on input making it a Non-Uniform AC circuit.  Though complement function is undecidable as described in http://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.4102v1.pdf, Non-uniform circuits "decide" undecidable languages by definition.

Old draft of the complement function - https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/ComplementOfAFunction_earlier_draft.pdf?attredirects=0 describes this and proposes a name of co-TC0 as integer multiplication is in TC0 (threshold circuits) which may not be true if the circuit size is super-polynomial. Super-polynomial size circuits are DC circuits allowing exponential size. Assuming polynomial size the above may be named as "Non-uniform co-TC" for lack of better naming.

Due to equivalence of Riemann Zeta Function and Euler's theorem - inverse(infiniteproduct(1-1/p(i)^z)) for all primes p(i) - gives a pattern in distribution of primes which is the Riemann Hypothesis of Re(nontrivial zeroes of RZF)=0.5. Complement function for xy=z obtained by http://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.4102v1.pdf by polynomial interpolation or Fourier approximation polynomial of the DNF boolean formula can thus be conjectured to have a strong relation to RZF or even generalize RZF. In circuit parlance, the DNF boolean formula and its minimized Non-uniform AC(if polynomial sized) circuit that outputs prime number bits, thus are related to non-trivial zeroes of Riemann Zeta Function. Another conjecture that can be made is that if the real part of the non-trivial zeroes is 0.5 in RZF, then the Non-uniform circuit family constructed for the above complement function DNF should also have a pattern in the circuit graph drawn - subgraphs of the circuit family of graphs have some common structure property.

Fourier polynomial of a boolean formula is of the form:
	f(x) = Sigma_S(fouriercoeff(S)parityfn(S))

and is multilinear with variables for each input. S is the restriction or powerset of the bit positions.

Thus if a prime number is b-bit, there are b fourier polynomials for each bit of the prime. Thus for x-th prime number fourier expression is,
	P(x) = 1+2*fx1(x)+2^2*fx2(x).....+2^b*fxb(x)
where each fxi() is one of the b fourier expansion polynomials for prime bits.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1276. Riemann Zeta Function written as Euler-Fourier Polynomial : - related to 24
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fourier polynomials for each prime can be substituted in Euler formula and equated to Riemann Zeta Function:
RZF = Inverse((1-1/P(x1)^s)(1-1/P(x2)^s))...ad infinitum---------------------------------------------------------------------(1).

Non-trivial complex zero s is obtained by,
	P(xi)^s = 1
	P(xi)	= (1)^(1/s)
	1+2*fx1(xi)+2^2*fx2(xi).....+2^b*fxb(xi) = (1)^(e^(-i*theta)/r) after rewriting in phasor notation s=r*e^(i*theta).-----------(2)

Above links Fourier polynomials for each prime to roots of unity involving non-trivial zeroes of Riemann Zeta Function in RHS. LHS is the xi-th prime number. Since LHS is real without imaginary part, RHS should also be real though exponent involves imaginary part. There are as many roots of unity in RHS as there are prime numbers. The radian is taninverse which is semi-determined assuming RH with Re(s) = 0.5.

LHS is multilinear with at most b variables for b bits of the prime number. A striking aspect of the above is that Fourier parity function is +1 or -1 and a lot of them might cancel out in the above summed up polynomial in LHS after substitution and rewriting.

If s is written as a+ic, then (1)^(1/s) = (1)^(1/a+ic) = (1)^((a-ic)/(a^2+c^2))

If RH is true a=0.5 and above becomes, (1)^((0.5-ic)/(0.25+c^2)).

	1+2*fx1(xi)+2^2*fx2(xi).....+2^b*fxb(xi) = (1)^((0.5-ic)/(0.25+c^2)) -----------(3)

Thus imaginary part c has one-to-one correspondence to each prime. Non-trivial zeroes are usually found using functional notation of RZF instead of the above - applying Analytic Continuation that extends the domain in steps to be exact. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1277. Delving deeper into (1) above which equates Riemann Zeta Function with Complement Function Fourier Polynomials substituted in Euler's infinite product (Hereinafter referred to as Euler-Fourier polynomial) - Pattern in primes from above Euler-Fourier polynomial: - related to 24
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Finding pattern in distribution of primes is equivalent to finding pattern in above set of prime bit circuits or fourier polynomials for each prime - The family of circuits for primes above has to be mined for circuit DAG subgraph patterns which is more of machine learning than complexity (there is almost no complexity theoretic reference to this aspect). The set of fourier polynomials can be mined for linear independence for example. (1),(2) and (3) are multiple ways of expressing same relation between complement function boolean circuit and RZF.

Similar to zeros of RZF, Fourier poynomial obtained from Euler's formula by substituting complement function prime bits fourier polynomials gives a very complex polynomial whose degree could be d*s in b variables, where d is the maximum degree in prime bit fourier polynomials. In randomized setting, Schwartz-Zippel Lemma can be applied for finding an upperbound for number of roots of this Fourier-Euler polynomial which is the traditional tool in Polynomial Identity Testing. Using the lemma, number of roots of the above polynomial is <= d*s/ |K| where K is the random finite subset of b variables in the boolean complement function. If |K| = b, then number of roots is upperbounded by d*s/b.[This is assuming rewriting as (2) or (3)]. But degree is a complex number d*s (It is not known if there is a Schwartz-Zippel Lemma for complex degree).  The roots of this Fourier-Euler polynomial should intuitively correspond to zeros of Riemann Zeta Function which probably gives a complexity theoretic expression of Riemann Zeta Function (than Analytic Number Theoretic). This implies that there should be complex roots also to the Euler-Fourier polynomial which itself is puzzling on what it means to have a complex number in boolean circuits. 

Important thing to note is that what it means to be a zero of the Euler-Fourier polynomial [(1),(2) and (3)] which has complex degree variable and also boolean variables within each clause. RZF just has the s in exponent. Thus Euler-Fourier polynomial is more generic and fine-grained. But zeroes of this polynomial are both within the multilinear components and the exponents instead of just in exponent in RZF. This might reveal more pattern than what RH predicts conjecturally. Moreover due to non-uniformity each Fourier polynomial component substituted in Euler formula for each prime, is different.

Sensitivity and Block sensitity of the above complement function circuit should also have a strong relation to prime distribution as sensitivity is the number of input bits or block of bits that are to be flipped for change in value of the circuit(prime bit is the value) . For each Fourier polynomial of a prime bit above the sensitivity measure would differ and  the prime distribution is proportional to collective sensitivity of all the prime bit circuit Fourier polynomials . Also the degree of approximating Fourier polynomial is lower bounded by sensitivity (www.cs.cmu.edu/~odonnell/papers/analysis-survey.pdf).

1278. Arithmetic Circuit for Euler Product and RZF - Alternative formulation to Euler-Fourier polynomials - related to 24
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Instead of a boolean circuit above can be an arithmetic circuit (with * and + gates with elements of some field as inputs to these) alternatively which is useful in representing polynomials. The division in the above Euler product can be replaced by the transform f/g = f/(1-(1-g)) = f*(1+(1-g)+(1-g)^2+...) by geometric series expansion. This is how division is implemented using powering and hence multiplication in NC circuits. Above Euler product can be represented as a depth 3 Pi-Sigma-Pi ----  * for product of each prime clause, + for subtraction within each clause, * for raising (1/p) to power s ---- circuit assuming 1/p. Powering with complex exponent s requires representing s as a 2*2 matrix M(s) where a and b are real and imaginary parts of s:
	
	M(s) =  | a  -b|
	        | b   a|

Thus p^s can be written as p^M(s) with matrix exponent. Rewriting this as e^(M(s) ln p) and expanding as series,

	e^(M(s) ln p) = 1 + M ln p + M*M lnp^2/2! + ...
and 	1 - 1/p^s = 1 - e^(-M(s) ln p) = 1-(1-M*ln p+ M*M ln p^2/2! - ...) = M*ln p - M*M ln p^2/2! + ... (alternating +,- terms ad infinitum) 

Thus each prime clause in the Euler product is written as an infinite summation of 2*2 matrix products. Using the transform f/g above division 1/(1-1/p^s) for each prime clause in the Euler product can be reduced to powering. Product gate at root multiplies all such prime clauses. Obviously above circuit is exponential and probably is the lowerbound for this circuit. If the product is made finite then a non-uniform arithmetic circuit family is created depending on input advice and degree of the above polynomial varies. This is an alternative to Euler-Fourier polynomial obtained based on complement function boolean circuit. No Fourier polynomial for prime bits is used here but prime power as such is input to arithmetic gates.

Instead of Euler formula, circuit for Riemann Zeta Function can be constructed with + gate at the root and circuits for n^s (or e^(s ln p)) computation at the leaves using the above series expansion.  For first n terms of RZF, the circuit represents the polynomial (with s replaced by the 2*2 matrix for the complex s):
	RZF(n) = n - M(s) * (ln 2 + ln 3 + ...+ ln n)/1! + M(s)^2 * ( ln 2^2 + ln3^2 +...+ lnn^2)/2! + ... + M(s)^n * (ln2^n + ...+lnn^n)/n!

The reason for drawing above arithmetic circuit is to represent the Riemann Zeta Function in complex plane as a circuit that depends on Matrix representation of complex number field(determinant of the matrix is the norm) and relate the roots of it to non-trivial zeroes of Riemann Zeta Function. The geometric intuition of Schwartz Zippel lemma is to find the probability of a point being on this circuit represented polynomial's surface. In the above circuit the variable is the Matrix M (matrix representation for the zero s). The imaginary part is hidden within the 2*2 matrices. The degree of above polynomial is n and is univariate in M. Non-uniform Sigma-Pi-Sigma Arithmetic circuit for above restricted version of Riemann Zeta Function can be constructed similar to the above for arbitrary n. 

Using Taylor series expansion and Jordan Normal Form above can be written as a huge square matrix.(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_function). Taylor series for a real function f(x) = f(0) + f'(0)/1! + f''(0)/2! + ... and 2*2 matrix for complex zero can be written in Jordan Normal Form as XYX^(-1) with Y being the Jordan block of diagonal fixed entries and superdiagonal 1s. Evaluating f(Y) with Taylor expansion gives a square matrix. Thus Riemann Zeta Function has a matrix in Jordan Normal Form. Finding zeros of RZF is equivalent to solving system of equations represented as Jordan Nomal Form using Gauss-Jordan Elimination. The matrix is already upper triangular and can be equated to zero matrix. 

Eigen values of Chaotic systems Wave modelling Random matrices (matrix as random variable) have been shown to have a striking relation to zeros of RZF - Spacing of Random matrix eigenphases and RZF zeros have been conjectured to be identical (Montgomery). From complexity standpoint, the characteristic polynomial or the determinant of such Random Matrices can be computed by determinant circuits which have polynomial size and polylog depth.

1279. Can be ignored - quite Experimental - Different way to reduce the complex exponent in (1) - related to 24
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From (1), P(xi)^s = 1.
=> P(xi) ^ (k+il) = 1 where s=k+il
=> P(xi)^k * P(xi)^(il) - 1 = 0
 P(xi)^k * [cos(l*ln(P(xi))) + i*sin(l*ln(P(xi)))] - 1 = 0	-----------------(4)

Thus real and imaginary parts can be equated to zero independently as,
	P(xi)^k * cos(l*ln(P(xi))) = 1 ------------------------------------------(5)

	P(xi)^k * sin(l*ln(P(xi))) = 0 ------------------------------------------(6)
	

From (5) and (6), it can be deduced that:

	tan(l*ln(P(xi))) = 0 ----------------------------------------------------(7)

From (7), it can be inferred that Re(s)=k is not involved and PIT has to be done only on the b+1 variables (b bits in primes and the Im(s)=l). This probably points to the fact that for all primes, the prime distribution is independent of the Re(s). Series expansion of (7) gives,

	tan(T) = T + T^3/3 + 2*T^5/15 + .... = 0  where T = l*ln(P(xi)) ---------(8)


l*ln(P(xi)) = 0 =>
	l = 0 or ln(P(xi)) = 0
	P(xi) = 1	
both of which can not hold. 

From (5),
	P(xi)^k = sec(l*ln(P(xi))) ----------------------------------------------(9)

if T = l*lnP(xi), e^(T/l) = P(xi)

	P(xi)^k = e^(kT/l) = 1+T^2/2 + 5T^4/24 + 61*T^6/720 + 277T^8/8064 + ... (expansion of sec)	---------- (10)

	1+kT/l + (kT/l)^2/2! + (kT/l)^3/3! + .... =	1 + T^2/2 + 5T^4/24 + ....(expansion of e^(KT/l))  --------(11) 


(5) can also be written as,

	ln P(xi)^k	=	ln(sec(l*ln(P(xi)))

	k	=	ln[sec(l*ln(P(xi)))] / lnP(xi)	-----------------------------------------------------------(12)

By RH k has to be 0.5 irrespective of RHS.

Approximation of l:
-------------------
By assuming k=0.5 and Using series expansion of cos(x) - choosing only first two terms, l is approximately,

	P(xi) = 1/[cos(l*lnP(xi))]^2			-----------------------------------------------------------(13)
	l = sqrt(2)*sqrt(sqrt(P(xi)) - 1) / ln (P(xi)	-----------------------------------------------------------(14)

More on (7):
------------
	tan(l*ln(P(xi))) = 0 implies that l*ln(P(xi)) = n*pi for some integer n. 
	ln(P(xi)) = n*pi/l
	P(xi) = e^(n*pi/l) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(15)

Above equates the Fourier polynomial for xi-th prime in terms of exponent of e with Imaginary part l of some RZF zero. It is not necessary that primes have one-one correspondence with zeros in the same order. All above just imply that it is true for some prime(and its Fourier polynomial) and some RZF zero that satisfy these identities.

1280. Ramanujan Graphs, Ihara Zeta Function and Riemann Zeta Function and Special case of Complement Function - related to 24
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A graph is Ramanujan graph if it is d-regular and eigen values of its adjacency matrix are sqrt(d-1)*2 or d. Ihara zeta function similar to RZF is a Dirichlet series that is based on prime cycle lengths of a graph defined as ProductOf(1/1-q^(-s*p)) where s is a zero and p prime for a (q+1)-regular graph. Thus a reduction is already available from RZF to a graph. The Ihara Zeta Function satisfies Riemann Hypothesis iff graph is Ramanujan - this follows from Ihara identity that relates Ihara Zeta Function and the adjacency matrix of a graph. Thus proving above conjecture for Euler-Fourier polynomial of complement function for primes boolean and arithmetic circuits family might need this gadget using prime cycles.

If a set of p-regular graphs for all primes is considered,then Riemann Zeta Function can be derived (using Ihara Zeta Function identity) as a function of product of Ihara Zeta Functions for these graphs and a function of the determinants of adjacency matrices for these graphs divided by an infinite product similar to Euler product with (1+1/p^s) clauses instead of (1-1/p^s). This requires computing product of determinants of a function of adjancency matrices for these graphs. A regular connected graph is Ramanujan if and only if it satisfies RH. Zeroes of the individual Ihara zeta functions are also zeroes of this product for the set of graphs and hence for the RZF. Intuitively the product might imply set of all paths of all possible lengths across these graphs. Determinant of the product of adjacent matrices is product of determinants of the matrices and equating it to zero yields eigenvalues. All these graphs have same number of edges and vertices. The eigen values then are of the form sqrt(q^(2-2a)+q^(2a)+2q) were s=a+ib for each of the regular graphs. The RHS of Ihara Zeta Function can be written as [(1+1/q^s)(1-1/q^s)]^[V-E] and the product gives the RZF and the other series mentioned above. Eigen values can be atmost q.

[If an eigen value is t (<= q), then it can be derived that
	q^s = q + (or) - sqrt(q^2 -4t) / 2
where s=a+ib. Setting a=0.5 is creating a contradiction apparently  which is above divided by sqrt(q) (while equating real and imaginary parts for q^(ib) or e^(ib*logq)- needs to be verified if this kind of derivation is allowed in meromorphic functions).]


Above and the Informal notes in https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/RamanujanGraphsRiemannZetaFunctionAndIharaZetaFunction.pdf?attredirects=0&d=1 can further be simplified as follows to get RZF in terms of IZF identity.

Disclaimer: It is not in anyway an attempted proof or disproof of RH as I am not an expert in analytical number theory. Hence arguments might be elementary. Following was found serendipitously as a surprise while working on special case of circuits for complement function for primes and it does not have direct relation to complementation - Fourier polynomial for Complement Function generalizes Riemann Hypothesis in a sense. Moreover, Notion of complementing a function is absent in mathematical literature I have searched so far except in mathematical logic. Following are derived based on Ihara Identity of Ihara Zeta Function.[https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/2014/08/18/the-riemann-hypothesis-for-graphs/#more-2824] for a prime+1 regular graph.

(1) For some i-th prime+1 regular graph (i.e q+1 regular graph where qi is prime),
			[1+qi^-s]				1
	-----------------------------------------	= -------------- 
	[zi(s)det(I-A*qi^-s + qi^(1-2s)*I]^(1/|V|-|E|)	     [1-qi^-s]


(2) Infinite product of the above terms for all prime+1 regular graphs gives the RZF in right in terms of
Ihara Zeta Function Identities product on the left -  The infinite set of prime+1 regular graphs relate to
RZF zeros.

(3) For non-trivial zeros s=a+ib,RZF in RHS is zero and thus either numerator product is zero or denominator product tends to infinity 

(4) From Handshake Lemma, it can be derived that a q-regular graph with order n(=|V| vertices) has
q*n/2 edges (=|E| edges)

(5) If numerator is set to zero in LHS, 
		q^(a+ib) = -1
and
		cos(blogq) + isin(blogq) = -1/q^a which seems to give further contradiction

(6) If denominator is set to infinity in LHS,
	[z1*z2*.....det()det()....]^1/|V|-|E| = Inf 
			(or)
	[z1*z2*.....det()det()....]^1/|E|-|V| = 0 

for some term in the infinite product of LHS which implies that
	[z1*z2*.....det()det()....] = 0 which is described earlier above in the notes. 

(7) More derivations of the above are in the notes uploaded in  handwritten preliminary drafts at: 
	(7.1) https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/RZFAndIZF_25October2014.pdf?attredirects=0&d=1
	(7.2) http://sourceforge.net/p/asfer/code/HEAD/tree/python-src/ComplFunction_DHF_PVsNP_Misc_Notes.pdf
	
(8) By equating the determinant in (6) above to zero, written notes in (7) derive values of s=a+ib for non-Ramanujan prime+1 regular graphs for the expressions in points (1) to (6) above. They seem to suggest that RH is true with elementary complex arithmetic without using any complex analysis, with or without any assumption on the eigenvalue surprisingly - assuming q^s + q^(1-s) = v (v can be set to any eigenvalue - can be atmost q+1 for the q+1-regular non-ramanujan graph) and solving for s=a+ib - gives a=1/2 and thus for both ramanujan and non-ramanujan graphs as eigen value becomes irrelevant - needs lot of reviewing - because it implies that graph formulation above of Riemann Hypothesis is true for all prime+1 regular graphs by applying Ihara Identity of Ihara Zeta Function and thus Riemann Hypothesis is true. The choice of prime+1 regularity is just a contrived gadget to equate to Riemann Zeta Function through an infinite product. Crucial fact is the independence of eigen value in the previous derivation whenever the graph regularity is prime+1, thus directly connecting prime numbers and real part of Riemann Zeta Function non-trivial zero.

(9) Above doesn't look circular also because infinite product of characteristic polynomials - determinants - are independent of infinite product of Ihara Zeta Functions preceding them in denominator - this happens only when the product z1*z2*... is not zero i.e when the graphs are non-ramanujan. The infinite product of determinants of the form det(I-A(qi)^(-s)+(qi)^(1-2s)I) when solved for zero do not depend on eigenvalue and s is assumed nowhere. Independence of eigen value implies all possible graphs. Further the last step is independent of regularity q too. Had it been circular, the eigenvalue for Ramanujan graph should have occurred somewhere in the derivation throwing back to square one.

(10) Expression in (1) for a prime+1 regular graph can also be equated to Euler-Fourier polynomial mentioned in (24c) per-prime term for each prime+1 regular graph - LHS is a graph while RHS is a fourier polynomial for boolean circuit for a prime - P(xi). Thus pattern in prime polynomials in RHS are related to patterns in graphs on left:
			[1+qi^-s]				1
	-----------------------------------------	= -------------- 
	[zi(s)det(I-A*qi^-s + qi^(1-2s)*I]^(1/|V|-|E|)	     [1-P(xi)^-s]

(11) qi can be replaced with Fourier polynomial P(xi),and the above becomes:
		[1-P(xi)^-2s] = [zi(s)det(I-A*P(xi)^-s + P(xi)^(1-2s)*I]^(1/|V|-|E|)
	(or)    [1-P(xi)^-2s]^(|V|-|E|) = [zi(s)det(I-A*P(xi)^-s + P(xi)^(1-2s)*I]

(12) LHS of (11) can be expanded with binomial series. Thus Euler-Fourier polynomial is coalesced into Ihara identity to give Euler-Fourier-Ihara polynomial for a prime(and hence corresponding prime+1 regular graph). Partial Derivatives of the above polynomial look crucial in deciphering pattern in primes - for example doe(s)/doe(P(xi)). 

(13) ACC circuits have support for mod(m) gates. Thus a trivial circuit for non-primality is set of mod(i) circuits - 1,2,3,...,sqrt(N) - that output 1 to an OR gate up (factor gates output 1). This non-primality circuit is equivalent to complement of complement function circuit for xy=z described previously (and it can be stated in its dual form also).

(14) The Fourier polynomial of a prime P(xi) is holographic in the sense that it has information of all primes due to the multiplexor construction.

(15) Without any assumption on Ihara and Riemann Zeta Functions, for any (q+1)-regular graph for prime q, just solving for eigenvalue in det[-[A - I*(q^s + q^(1-s))]] to get Real(s) = 0.5 looks like an independent identity in itself where A is adj matrix of graph. It neither requires Riemann Zeta Function nor Ihara Zeta Function to arrive at Real(s)=0.5.

(16) In (15), even the fact that q has to be prime is redundant.  Just solving for q^s + q^(1-s) = some_eigen_value gives Real(s)=0.5. In such a scenario what the set {Imaginary(s)} contains is quite non-trivial. It need not be same as {Imaginary(RZF_zero)}.

(17) Assuming Real(s)=0.5 from 7.1 and 7.2, it can be derived with a little more steps that eigen_value = 2*sqrt(q)*cos(b*log(q)) - eigen value depends only on imaginary(s) and regularity.

(18) It is not known if {Imaginary(RZF_zero)} = {Imaginary(s)}. If not equal this presents a totally different problem than RZF and could be a disjoint_set/overlap/superset of RZF zeroes.

(19) Maximum eigen value of (q+1)-regular graph is (q+1) and the infinite set {Imaginary(s)} can be derived from eigen_value=2*sqrt(q)*cos(b*log(q)) in (17) for infinite set of (q+1)-regular graphs.

(20) An experimental python function to iterate through all {Imaginary(s)} mentioned in (19) supra has been included in complement.py. Because of the restriction that cos() is in [-1,1], eigen_value <= 2*sqrt(q) which has a trivial value of q=1 when eigen_value=q+1.

(21) (SOME EXPERIMENTATION ON DISTRIBUTION OF PRIMES) List of primes read by complement.py is downloaded from https://primes.utm.edu/lists/. IharaIdentity() function in complement.py evaluates Imaginary(s)=b=arccos(v/(2*sqrt(q)))/log(q) by incrementing v by small steps in a loop till it equals 2*sqrt(q). This allows v to be in the range [0,2*sqrt(q)] whereas Ramanujan graphs require it to be 2*sqrt(q-1) or q. Hence non-ramanujan graphs are also allowed. Logs in testlogs/ print all Imaginary(s) iterations of this eigenvalues for all 10000 primes. arccos() function returns radians which is a cyclic measure and hence can take x+2*y*pi where y=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,... which could be arbitrarily large infinite set. Logs print only x with y=0 and not all cycles. Prima facie visual comparison shows this set to be different from Imaginary(RZF) for x alone which could be inaccurate. Sifting through all cycles and verifying if these are indeed Im() parts of RZF might be an arduous task and could be undecidable too because two infinite sets have to be compared for equality. But theoretically the Re() part of (2) which is infinite product of (1) equivalent to Riemann Zeta Function is 0.5 for all while Im() part is computationally intensive. Crucial evidence that comes out of it is the possibility of cyclic values of radians in b=arccos(v/(2*sqrt(q))/log(q) which implies a fixed (prime, eigenvalue) ordered tuple correspond to infinitely many b(s) (Im() parts). Thus 2*sqrt(q)*cos(b*log(q)) = eigen_value is a generating function mining pattern in distribution of primes. Rephrasing, b has generating function: b <= (x + 2*y*pi)/logq, where 0 <= x <= pi/2. SequenceMining.py also has been applied to binary representation of first 10000 prime numbers (Commit Notes 273 below) which is learning theory way of finding patterns in distribution in primes. Logs for the most frequent sequences in prime strings in binary have been committed in testlogs/. These binary sequences mined from first 10000 primes have been plotted in decimal with R+rpy2 function plotter. Function plot in decimal shows sinusoidal patterns in mined sequences with periodic peaks and dips as the length of sequence increases i.e the mined sequences in prime binary strings periodically have leftmost bits set to 1 and rightmost bits set to 1 and viceversa which causes decimals to vacillate significantly. Primes are not regular and context-free languages which are known from formal languages theory. The function doing complementation in complement.py can be translated to Turing Machine by programming languages Brainfuck and Laconic which is equivalent to a lambda function for complement.

1281. PAC Learning and Complement Function Construction - related to 24
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Complement Boolean Function construction described in http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.4102 is in a way an example of PAC learnt Boolean Function - it is rather C Learnt (Correct Learning) because there is no probability or approximation. Complement Boolean Function can be PAC learnt (with upperbounded error) as follows:
        - There are two datasets - dataset1 of size 2^n of consecutive integers and dataset2 of first n-bit prime numbers of size 2^n 
        - Each element of dataset1 is mapped to i-th bit of the corresponding prime number element in the dataset2. Boolean Conjunction is learnt for each of the i mappings (PAC Learning Algorithm: http://www.cis.temple.edu/~giorgio/cis587/readings/pac.html).
        - Above step gives n probabilistic, approximate, correct learnt boolean conjunctions for each bit of all the 2^n prime numbers.

1282. Star Complexity and Complement Function Circuit Lowerbound (related to 24,198)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Star Complexity of a Boolean Circuit is the minimum number of AND and OR gates required in monotone circuit graph. Size lowerbound for Complement Function circuit can thus be lowerbounded by Strong Magnification Lemma (Stasys Jukna - http://www.thi.informatik.uni-frankfurt.de/~jukna/ftp/graph-compl.pdf) - Size(ComplementCircuit) >= Star(ComplementCircuitGraph) - (2 + o(1))*n . Mapping from Boolean Circuit to Graph is done through a bipartite graph gadget wherein a boolean variable x(v1,v2) iff there is an edge from v1 to v2 in the bipartite graph and replacing each boolean literal by an OR of two new variables. Star Complexity views Boolean Circuits as a graph and for most graphs it is Omega(n^2/logn). Obtaining Size Lowerbounds for arbitrary complement functions is non-trivial.

Additional references:
---------------------
	34.3 Above PRAM k-merge algorithm implies Factorization is in NC, a far more audacious claim than Factorization in P. It has been disputed if PRAM is indeed in NC because of input size being N and not logN. But there have been insurmountable evidences so far which all point to PRAM model being equivalent to NC circuits in certain conditions and NC circuit nodes can simulate PRAM with polylog upperbound on number of bits [HooverGreenlawRuzzo]- https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ruzzo/papers/limits.pdf . References for this are in LaTex and PDF links previously and also mentioned below in "Additional References"

	34.4) (IMPORTANT OPTIMIZATION OVER 34.1, 34.2 ABOVE) Instead of [BerkmanSchieberVishkin] an O(logloglogN) algorithm can be used described in (since the numbers in tiles are within a known range - 1 to N - for factorization of N in discretized tesselated hyperbolic arc) - Triply-Logarithmic Parallel Upper and Lower Bounds for Minimum and Range Minima over Small Domains (Omer Berkman, Yossi Matias, Prabhakar Ragde) - 1998 - http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196677497909056. This algorithm internally applies [BerkmanSchieberVishkin] but lemmas 2.3 and 3.1 mentioned in [BerkmanMatiasPrabhakar] preprocess the input within a known domain [1..N]. This takes O(logloglogN) time using (logN)^3/logloglogN processors for each merging problem and O(logloglogN) time using N/logloglogN processors overall. This algorithm can therefore supersede 34.1 and 34.2.

	34.5) Randomized Algorithms ,Rajeev Motwani and Prabhakar Raghavan, Chapter 12 on Distributed and Parallel Algorithms, also describes input size and randomized algorithms for Parallel sort - Definition 12.1 of NC (Page 336) - "NC consists of languages that have PRAM algorithms with O(logN) time and O(N^k) PRAM processors".

	34.6) Also an alternative merge algorithm in constant depth polysize circuit described in Chandra-Stockmeyer-Vishkin [http://cstheory.com/stockmeyer@sbcglobal.net/csv.pdf] can be applied (but it is for merging two lists of m, m-bit numbers where as the above factorization needs merging two lists of O(m), log(m)-bit numbers)

	34.7) [RichardKarp-VijayaRamachandran] define the inclusion of PRAM models in NC in page 29 of http://digitalassets.lib.berkeley.edu/techreports/ucb/text/CSD-88-408.pdf - NCk in EREWk in CREWk in CRCWk=ACk in NC(k+1). [KarpRamachandran] cite [HooverKlawePippenger] - Bounding Fanout in Logical Networks - http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=322412 - for this inclusion. Thus references for PRAM=NC imply All Nearest Smaller Values (ANSV) CRCW PRAM algorithm [BerkmanSchieberVishkin] is also in NC counterintuitively despite the input size being N=n (and not logN).

        34.11) The crucial fact in the above is not the practicality of having order of n parallel processors with RAM to get the logarithmic time lowerbound (which looks costly in number of PRAMs wise), but the equivalence of PRAM to NC which is theoretically allowed despite input size being n instead of logn (because each PRAM cell mapped to a circuit element can have polylogn bits and polyn such PRAMs are allowed) which is sufficient for Discrete Hyperbolic Factorization to be in NC.

	34.16) There is a commercially available Parallel CRCW RAM chip implementation by NVIDIA CUDA GPUs - http://developer.nvidia.com/cuda and XMT research project - www.umiacs.umd.edu/users/vishkin/XMT/ but not for CREW PRAM which is a limitation of implementing All Nearest Smaller Values PRAM merge for discretized hyperbolic arc and doing a benchmark.

I don't understand why some CS theory people apologize for the PRAM. NC is robust and interesting as a complexity class, and an easy way to show that a problem is in NC is to give a PRAM algorithm. That's all the argument I need for the PRAM's existence. And yes, I've heard all of the arguments about why the PRAM is completely unrealistic ..."

	34.19) [Page 29 - HooverGreenlawRuzzo] - "... but there is no a priori upper bound on the fanout of a gate. Hoover, Klawe, and Pippenger show that conversion to bounded fanout entails at most a constant factor increase in either size or depth [160]..."

	34.20) (DONE-BITONIC SORT IMPLEMENTATION) In the absence of PRAM implementation, NC Bitonic Sort has been invoked as a suitable alternative in parallel tile merge sort step of Parallel Discrete Hyperbolic Factorization Implementation. Commit Notes 261-264 and 265-271 below have details on this. Bitonic Sort on SparkCloud requires O((logn)^2) time with O(n^2logn) parallel comparators (which simulate PRAM but comparators required are more than PRAMs). With this NC factorization has been implemented on a Spark cloud.

	34.21) An important point to note in above is that an exhaustive search in parallel would always find a factor, but in how many steps is the question answered by NC computational geometric search. This is 1-dimensional geometric factorization counterpart of 2-dimensional Graham's Scan and Jarvis March for Convex Hull of n points. A parallel algorithm in O(n) steps wouldn't have qualified to be in NC. Above NC algorithm scans just an one-dimensional tesselated merged tiles of a hyperbolic arc in O((logn)^2) for merge + O(logn) for search and doesn't scan more than 1-dimension. Parallel tesselation of O(n) long hyperbolic arc to create locally sorted tile segments requires < O(logn) steps only if number of processors is > O(n/logn). Hence it adheres to all definitions of NC. Thus total parallel work time is O((logn)^2) + O(logn) + O(logn) = O((logn)^2). Here again N=n.

	34.24) [DexterKozen-CheeYap] - Cell Decomposition is in NC - http://anothersample.net/order/fe1d53539cff07d3e836ccc499d443b38b2848ba - This is a deep Algebraic Geometry/Topology result for Cell Decomposition by constructing NC circuit for it. Coincidentally, the connection between NC factorization and geometry conjectured in 35 below is already present as evidenced by this. This algorithm is for Cell decomposition of a manifold in arbitrary dimensions - a set of disjoint union of cells created by intersecting polynomials. For NC factorization, the polynomial of interest is hyperbola. Illustration in [Kozen-Yap] - page 517 - is for 0,1,2-dimension cells with 2 polynomials - parabola and circle. This corresponds to tesselation step of factorization where a continuous hyperbola is discretized into disjoint union of cells.

	34.25) Cell decomposition for tesselation of hyperbola can be created in two ways. In the first example, set of polynomials are {hyperbola, stepfunction1, stepfunction2, y=k forall integer k}. Geometrically the hyperbola is bounded above and below by 2 step functions i.e hyperbola intersects a grid of x-y axes lines. This creates 2-dimensional cells above and below hyperbola ensconced between 2 step functions which are homeomorphic to R^2 (there is a bijective map between cells and R^2 - Topology - James Munkres}. Each cell has same sign for a polynomial {above=+1, on=0, below=-1}. This cell decomposition is in NC. Cells above and below hyperbola have to be merged to get squared tesselation.

	34.26) In another example Cell decomposition is created by intersection of integer y-axis lines and hyperbola which results in set of 0-cells (discrete set of points on hyperbola).

        34.28) Tiling of Hyperbolic curve: The discretization step of a hyperbola to form set of contiguous tiled segments has been mentioned as "Tesselation" throughout this document which could be a misnomer. Precise equivalent of this tiling is pixelation in Computer Graphics where an image bitmap is downsampled to create a low-resolution approximation of image - in this example, an image of hyperbolic curve is pixelated to g et a tiled set of segments (http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/PixelizationOfAFont/ shows how a letter A is pixelated to create stylized pixelated A).

        34.29) The tiling of hyperbolic curve is done by deltax = N/[y∗(y+1)] which is a process similar to low-pass filter or Box Blur in Graphics. In a parallel setting with PRAMs or Parallel Bitonic Sort, the preprocessing step required is the tiled hyperbolic arc already in place spread out across all nodes of total number O(N/logN). This naive tiling though not as sophisticated as Box Blur Gaussian Filter, needs time O(logN) for each node i.e delta computation per coordinate is O(1) and each node is allotted O(logN) long arc segment and thus O(1*logN) per node.

Similar notion of pixelation holds for pixelating hyperbola pq=N for finding factors p and q of integer N. Art Gallery problem in computational geometry finds minimum number of vantage points to guard the art gallery. If hyperbolic curve is considered as an art gallery, and guards have visibility only in vertical and horizontal directions, pixelation creates set of rectangles bounded by vantage points ensconcing the hyperbola. This illuminates the hyperbola completely.

It is an open problem to find an efficient data structure for parallel ray shooting which searches n points in parallel by shooting n light rays.

 Pixelation of Hyperbola pq=N (described in 465) creates a polygon covering it and Factors of N are points located in the vertices of this polygon: Parallel Planar Point Location algorithms involve Cascading technique to find the factor query points p and q on the faces of this polygon. Cascading algorithms execute in multiple levels of the processor tree per stage and there are logarithmic number of stages - O(logN) parallel time. Cascading derives its nomenclature from relay nature of computation. Node at height h is "woken-up" and computes its subtree only after certain number of stages e.g h. This reduces integer factorization to Parallel Planar Point Location on Polygon.

	34.81) An Oracle Result for relativized BQP and P - [Fortnow-Rogers] - https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9811023.pdf - There exists an oracle A for which P^A = BQP^A - Theorems 4.1,4.2,4.3 - Pages 9-10 - This is significant because  with respect to some oracle, Quantum computation is equivalent to and can be simulated by Deterministic Classical Computation in polynomial time. In the context of PRAM-NC factorization, this theorem applies because NC^A is in P^A (Christopher Wilson - https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-16486-3_111) for any oracle A. Sequential Optimization for Computational Geometric Factorization mentioned in 506 implies a weaker result - Factorization is in P. An example Oracle for Factorization is the set of beacons (approximate factors) obtained by Ray-Shooting queries. Shor's Quantum Factorization (mentioned in 350) involves period finding - finding period r such that f(x)=f(x+r). Ray shooting queries are also period finding algorithms in the sense that gaps between prime factors are estimated approximately - if f is a ray shooting query oracle A, querying f returns the next prime factor pf(n+1) = pf(n) + gap (exactly or approximately) in classical deterministic polynomial time which is in NC^A or P^A. Ray shooting can be performed in both P and BQP from the previous equivalence of period finding and prime factor gap ray shooting i.e in P^A and BQP^A.

Persistent Binary Search Trees are versioned Binary Trees which support insert/delete and preserve the past history of the Binary Search Tree for queries. Factorization is a Planar Point Location problem - Pixelated hyperbolic tile segments create set of polygons (arrays of pixels forming a rectangle of dimension 1 * length_of_tile_segment) and these polygons divide 2D plane. Factor points (pixels) are located in some of these polygons. Planar Point Location retrieves the polygon containing the factor point in O(logN) time. This retrieved polygon tile segment can in turn be binary searched in O(logN) time because of implicit sortedness (either x or y axis points are strictly ascending). To be in NC, Parallel RAM Construction of Persistent Binary Search Tree is necessary.

VITTER] - Parallel RAM construction of Bridge Separator Tree for Planar Point Location - http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.72.4319&rep=rep1&type=pdf - Separators are st-paths in planar subdivision graph formed by the hyperbolic line segments of pixel-array polygons on 2D plane. "...The separator tree uses O(n) space and supports point location queries in O((logn)^2) time, where n is the number of vertices of S [33]..." - Lemma 4.5 - "... Let S be a regular subdivision with n vertices. The bridged separator tree for point location in S can be constructed by an EREW PRAM in O(log n) time using n/log n processors, which is optimal ...". Thus a factor point N=pq within some of the hyperbolic pixel-array polygons can be found in O((logN)^2 + logN) = O((logN)^2) PRAM time and O(N/logN) processors. Number of rectangle polygons in planar subdivision created by the hyperbolic pixel-array = N of vertices 4*N. This concurs with O((logN)^2) to O((logN)^3) PRAM time for Segment Trees. This factorization by parallel planar point location is work-optimal and is in NC requiring N/logN processors.

Input wires are connected by comparator at specific points. Inputs traversing this graph while finding a comparator are swapped if top wire has greater value than bottom wire. This process propagates till the output is reached. Output gates contain sorted integers. Logdepth sorting networks are constructed by Bipartite Expander Graphs - approximate halvers - which split the inputs into two sets of smallest and largest in two halves of the wires (bitonic). This implies computational geometric sorting networks of O(logN) time for sorting the hyperbolic tile segments and finding the factors by binary search but constant in O(logN) is notoriously huge.

This lowerbound is relevant to Computational geometric factorization by binary searching hyperbolic tile pixelation on PRAMs(number of variables = number of bits in integer to factorize). Integer factorization circuits on PRAMs (e.g PRAM circuits for parallel planar point location algorithms to locate a factor point on hyperbolic arc bow) have polylogarithmic depth (parallel time) and for each PRAM in the longest path from root to leaf of the circuit, this lowerbound applies. Factorization lowerbound for all PRAMs along this longest path is Omega((logN)^k*logloglogN) if n=logN.

35. (THEORY) Above Discrete Hyperbolic Factorization can be used as a numerical dataset analysis technique.

B.	EXPERIMENTAL NON-STATISTICAL INFERENCE MODEL BASED ON ALREADY KNOWN THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE RESULTS:
########################################################################################################################

36.1. (FEATURE - DONE-WordNet Visualizer implementation for point 15) The classification using Interview Algorithm Definition Graph (obtained from Recursive Gloss Overlap algorithm described in http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.4458 , https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/TAC2010papersubmission.pdf?attredirects=0 and http://www.nist.gov/tac/publications/2010/participant.papers/CMI_IIT.proceedings.pdf ) wordnet node indegrees can classify a same document in multiple classes without any training set (unsupervised). Thus same document will be in multiple classes. This can be visualized as one stack per class and documents in same class are pushed into a stack corresponding to each class. When a same document is across multiple classes, a document can be visualized as a "hyperedge" of a hypergraph that transcends multiple class nodes. Here each class node in this non-planar graph (or multi-planar graph) is a stack.

36.2. (THEORY) Thus if number of classes and documents are infinite, an infinite hypergraph is obtained. This is also somewhat a variant of an inverted index or a hashtable where in addition to hashing ,the chained buckets across the keys are interconnected (Quite similar to https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/SurvivalIndexBasedTxnTimeoutManager.pdf?attredirects=0 and https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/PhDThesisProposal.pdf?attredirects=0). This is also similar to "Connectionism" in Computational Psychology which allows cycles or interconnections in Perceptrons and Neural Networks. An old version of this was written in an old deleted blog few years ago in 2006 at: http://shrinivaskannan.blogspot.com. If the relation between Hash Functions and Integer Partitions is also applied as described using Generating Functions in https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/IntegerPartitionAndHashFunctions.pdf?attredirects=0 then an upperbound on number of possible Hypergraphs (visualizing them as interconnected Hash tables) can be derived which is a stronger notion to prove.

37.(FEATURE - PoC WordNet Visualizer Closure DONE) Above multiplanar hypergraph is quite related as a theoretical construct to a Pushdown Automata for Context Free Grammar. Also the Definition Graph Construction using Recursive Gloss Overlap is a Context-Sensitive counterpart of Parse Trees obtained for Context Free Grammar, but ignoring Parts-Of-Speech Tagging and relying only on the relation between words or concepts within each sentence of the document which is mapped to a multipartite or general graph. Infact this Definition Graph and Concept Hypergraph constructed above from indegrees quite resemble a Functional Programming Paradigm where each relationship edge is a Functional Program subroutine and the vertices are the parameters to it. Thus a hyperedge could be visualized as Composition Operator of Functional Programs including FP routines for Parts-of-Speech if necessary [WordNet or above Concept Hypergraph can be strengthened with FPs like LISP, Haskell etc.,]. RecursiveNeuralNetworks(MV-RNN and RNTN) have a notion of compositionality quite similar to Functional Programming in FPs (Reference: http://nlp.stanford.edu/~socherr/EMNLP2013_RNTN.pdf ) but for tree structures. Applying the compositionality for Concept Hypergraphs constructed above using FPs is a possible research direction.

38.(THEORY) But above is not context free because context is easily obtainable from the hyperedge which connects multiple classes. As an experimental gadget above seems to represent an alternative computational model for context sensitivity and also process of human thought. This needs HyperEdge Search algorithms for hypergraph. A Related Neuropsychological notion of Hippocampus Memory Allocation in Human Brain can be found in http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~valiant/Hippocampus.pdf. Also a similar gadget is a special case of Artificial Neural Network - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopfield_network - Hopfield Network - used to model human associative memory (pattern based memory retrieval than address based retrieval). Hyperedges of the above hypergraph can be memory vectors retrieved in an associative memory.

39.(THEORY) An interesting academic question to pose is - "Does the above hypergraph have a strong connectivity and a diameter upperbounded by a constant?". Equivalently, is the collection of universal knowledge close-knit or does nature connect seemingly unrelated concepts beyond what is "observable"? For example, path algorithms for Hypergraphs etc., can be applied to check s-t connectivity of two concepts. Some realworld linear programming and optimization problems which have strong natural applications are KnapSack problem,Tiling Problem or Packing problem that occur in everyday life of humanbeings (packing items for travel, arranging on a limited space etc.,). Thus the concept hypergraph might have a path connecting these.  

40.(THEORY) A recent result of Rubik's cube (http://www.cube20.org/) permutations to get solution having a constant upperbound (of approximately 20-25 moves) indicates this could be true (if all intermediary states of Rubik's transitions are considered as vertices of a convex polytope of Concepts then isn't this just a Simplex algorithm with constant upperbound? Is every concept reachable from any other within 20-25 moves? Or if the above hypergraph is considered as a variant of Rubik's Cube in higher dimensions, say "Rubik's Hypercube" then is every concept node reachable from the other within 20 logical implication moves or is the diameter upperbounded by 20?).  Most problems for hypergraph are NP-Complete which are in P for graphs thus making lot of path related questions computationally harder. Counting the number of paths in hypergraph could be #P-Complete. There was also a recent study on constant upperbound for interconnectedness of World Wide Web document link graph which further substantiates it (http://www9.org/w9cdrom/160/160.html - paragraph on diameter of the Strongly Connected Component Core of WWW). Probably this is a special case of Ramsey theory that shows order emerging in large graphs (monochromatic subgraphs in an arbitrary coloring of large graph).

41.(THEORY) Mapping Rubik's Cube to Concept Wide Hypergraph above - Each configuration in Rubik's Cube transition function can be mapped to a class stack node in the Concept Hypergraph. In other words a feature vector uniquely identifies each node in each class stack vertex of the Hypergraph. Thus move in a Rubik's cube is nothing but the hyperedge or a part of the hyperedge that contains those unique vectors. Thus hyperedges signify the Rubik's cube moves. For example if each class stack vertex is denoted as c(i) for i-th class and each element of the stack is denoted by n(i) i.e. nth element of stack for class i, then the ordered pair [c(i),n(i)] uniquely identifies a node in class stack and correspondingly uniquely identifies an instantaneous face configuration of a Rubik's Hypercube(colored subsquares represent the elements of the feature vector). Thus any hyperedge is a set of these ordered pairs that transcend multiple class stacks.

42.(THEORY) The Multiplanar Primordial Field Turing Machine model described by the author in "Theory of Shell Turing Machines" in [http://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/UndecidabilityOfFewNonTrivialQuestions.pdf?attredirects=0] with multiple dimensions seems to be analogous to the above. If dimension info is also added to each plane in above hypergraph then both above formulations and Shell Turing Machines look strikingly similar. One more salient feature of this hypergraph is that each class node stack indirectly encodes timing information for events from bottom to top of the stack and height of each stack independently varies. Thus this is more than just a hypergraph. There also exists a strong similarity with Evocation WordNet (one word "reminding" or "evocative" of the other) - http://wordnet.cs.princeton.edu/downloads.html - difference being above is a hypergraph of facts or concepts rather than just words. The accuracy of sense disambiguation is high or even 100% because context is the hyperedge and also depends on how well the hyperedges are constructed connecting the class stack vertices.

43.(THEORY) Instead of a wordnet if a relationship amongst logical statements (First Order Logic etc.,) by logical implication is considered then the above becomes even more important as this creates a giant Concept Wide Web as mentioned in [http://sourceforge.net/projects/acadpdrafts/files/ImplicationGraphsPGoodEquationAndPNotEqualToNPQuestion_excerpts.pdf/download] and thus is an alternative knowledge representation algorithm.

44.(THEORY)  Implication graphs of logical statements can be modelled as a Random Growth Network where a graph is randomly grown by adding new edges and vertices over a period of learning. 

45.(THEORY)  If a statistical constraint on the degree of this graph is needed, power law distributions (Zipf, Pareto etc.,) can be applied to the degrees of the nodes along with Preferential Attachment of newborn nodes.

46.(THEORY) Set cover or Hitting Set of Hypergraph is a Transversal of hypergraph which is a subset of set of vertices in the hypergraph that have non-empty intersection with every hyperedge. Transversal of the above Concept Wide Hypergraph is in a way essence of the knowledge in the hypergraph as in real world what this does is to grasp some information from each document (which is a hyperedge of class vertices) and produces a "summary nucleus subgraph" of the knowledge of the encompassing hypergraph.

47.(THEORY)  Random walk on the above concept hypergraph, Cover time etc., which is a markov process. Probably, Cover time of the hypergraph could be the measure of time needed for learning the concept hypergraph.

48.(THEORY - IMPLEMENTATION - DONE)  Tree decomposition or Junction Trees of concept hypergraph with bounded tree width constant.[If Junction tree is constructed from Hypergraph modelled as Bayesian Network, then message passing between the treenodes can be implemented, but still needs to be seen as what this message passing would imply for a junction tree of concept hypergraph above.]. A tree width measure computing script for Recursive Gloss Overlap graph for a text document has been added in python-src/InterviewAlgorithm which is a standard graph complexity measure.

49.(THEORY)  2(or more)-dimensional random walk model for thinking process and reasoning (Soccer model in 2-dimensions):
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As an experimental extension of point 47 for human reasoning process,  random walk on non-planar Concept hypergraph (collective wisdom gained over in the past) or a planar version of it which is 2-dimensional can be theorized. Conflicts in human mind could mimick the bipartite competing sets that make it a semi-random walk converging in a binary "decision". Semi randomness is because of the two competing sets that drive the "reasoning" in opposite directions. If the planar graph is generalized as a complex plane grid with no direction restrictions (more than 8), and the direction is anything between 0 to 2*pi radians, then the distance d after N steps is sqrt(N) (summation of complex numbers and the norm of the sum) which gives an expression for decision making time in soccer model.(related: http://web.archive.org/web/20041210231937/http://oz.ss.uci.edu/237/readings/EBRW_nosofsky_1997.pdf). In other words, if mental conflict is phrased as "sequence of 2 bipartite sets of thoughts related by causation" then "decision" is dependent on which set is overpowering. That is the corresponding graph vertices are 2-colored, one color for each set and yet not exactly a bipartite graph as edges can go between nodes of same set. Brownian Motion is also a related to this. Points (53.1) and (53.2)  describe a Judge Boolean Function (with TQBF example) which is also a decision making circuit for each voter in P(Good) summation with interactive prover-verifier kind of adversarial notions based on which a voter makes a choice.

C.	Slightly Philosophical - Inferences from conflicting opinions:
################################################################################## 

50. (DONE) As an example, if there are "likes" and "dislikes" on an entity which could be anything under universe - human being, machine, products, movies, food etc., then a fundamental and hardest philosophical question that naturally has evaded an apt algorithm: Is there a way to judge an entity in the presence of conflicting witnesses - "likes" and "dislikes" - and how to ascertain the genuineness of witnesses. In http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.4458 and http://www.nist.gov/tac/publications/2010/participant.papers/CMI_IIT.proceedings.pdf this has been the motivation for Interview Algorithm and P(Good) error probability for majority voting which is the basis for this. Moreover the opinions of living beings are far from correct due to inherent bias and prejudices which a machine cannot have.

51. (DONE) Another philosophical question is what happens to the majority voting when every voter or witness is wrong intentionally or makes an error by innocous mistake.[http://sourceforge.net/projects/acadpdrafts/files/ImplicationGraphsPGoodEquationAndPNotEqualToNPQuestion_excerpts.pdf/download]. This places a theoretical limitation on validity of "perceptional judgement" vis-a-vis the "reality".

52. (THEORY) There is a realword example of the above - An entity having critical acclaim does not have majority acclaim often. Similarly an entity having majority acclaim does not have critical acclaim. Do these coincide and if yes, how and when? This could be a Gaussian where tails are the entities getting imperfect judgements and the middle is where majority and critical acclaim coincide.

53. (THEORY) Items 50,51,52 present the inherent difficulty of perfect judgement or perfect inference. On a related note,Byzantine algorithms have similar issues of deciding on a course of action in the presence of faulty processors or human beings and faulty communications between them. Thus, probably above problem reduces to Byzantine i.e Faulty human beings or machines vote "like" or "dislike" on an entity and a decision has to be taken. This is also in a way related to Boolean Noise Sensitivity where collective intelligence of an entity can be represented as a "judging" boolean function and its decision tree. This "judge" boolean function accepts arguments from two opposing parties and outputs 1 or 0 in favour of one of them. How perfect is this "judge" depends on NoiseSensitivity of its boolean function. Thus a perfect judge boolean function is 100% NoiseStable even though attempts are made to confuse it through noise inputs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
53.1 (THEORY) Judge Boolean Function (there doesn't seem to be an equivalent to this in literature - hence it is defined as below):
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Judge Boolean function f:(0,1)^n->(0,1) has two classes of input sets of bit sets (x1,x2,x3,...) and (y1,y2,y3,...) corresponding to two adversarial parties x and y and outputs 0 (in favor of x) or 1 (in favor of y) based on the decision tree algorithm internal to f. Each xi and yi are sets of bits and hence input is set of sets (Intuitively such classes of boolean functions should be part of interactive proof systems.). This function is quite relevant to P(Good) summation because:
	- LHS PRG/Dictator boolean function choice can also be thought of as randomly chosen Judge boolean function (from a set of judge boolean functions) defined above. NoiseStability of this Judge boolean function is its efficacy.
	- In RHS, each voter has a judge boolean function above and NoiseStability of Boolean Function Composition of Maj*Judge is its efficacy.
	- An example: From https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/InterviewAlgorithmInPSPACE.pdf?attredirects=0, Judge Boolean Function can be a Quantified Boolean Formula (QBF) i.e (There exists f(xi) (For all g(yk) ...(((...))). Intuitively this simulates a debate transcript (prover-verifier) between x and y that is moderated by the QBF judge boolean function. Of interest is the NoiseStability of this QBF.
	- QBF is PSPACE-complete and hence Judge Boolean Function is PSPACE-complete. 
        - Thus LHS of P(good) is in PSPACE (a pseudorandomly chosen Judge Boolean Function) while RHS of P(good) is still in PH=DC where each voter's Judge Boolean Function is fed into Majority circuit inputs, because, if the QBF is of finite depth then RHS is depth-restricted and due to this RHS is in PH=DC. Thus if P(Good) probability is 1 on either side then there exists a PSPACE algorithm for PH implying PSPACE=PH than an intimidatingly unacceptable P=PH. If there is no quantifier depth restriction on either side both LHS and RHS can grow infinitely making both of them EXP. This makes Judge Boolean Function somewhat a plausible Voter Oracle than simple boolean functions - each voter is intrinisically allowed an intelligence to make a choice amongst 2 adversaries.
	- Since Judgement or Choice among two adversaries is a non-trivial problem, it is better to have each Voter's SAT in RHS and that of pseudorandom choice in LHS to be in the hardest of complexity classes known. Thus interpretation of convergence of P(Good) series depends on hardness of judgement boolean function (it could be from simple 2-SAT,3-SAT,k-SAT upto PSPACE-QBFSAT and could be even more upto Arithmetic Hierarchy) some of which might have circuit_complexity(LHS) == circuit_complexity(RHS) while some might not.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
53.2 (THEORY) P(Good) Convergence, Voter TQBF function, PH-completeness and EXP-completeness - Adversarial reduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
P(Good) RHS is in PH if depth restricted and in EXP if depth unrestricted. LHS is a pseudorandomly chosen Judge Boolean Function. PH-completeness or EXP-completeness of RHS remains to be proven (if not obvious). PH is the set of all problems in polynomial hierarchy - PH=U sigma(p,i). For every i there exists a problem in sigma(p,i) that is sigma(p,i)-complete. If there exists a PH-complete problem then PH collapses to sigma(p,i) for some level i.[Arijit Bishnu - http://www.isical.ac.in/~arijit/courses/spring2010/slides/complexitylec12.pdf] . Hence it remains an open question if there exists a PH-complete problem. Thus instead of depth restriction, the hardest depth unrestricted EXP circuit class(EXP=DC) is analyzed as a Judge Boolean Function. There are known EXP-complete problems e.g. Generalized Chess with n*n board and 2n pawns - [Fraenkel - http://www.ms.mff.cuni.cz/~truno7am/slozitostHer/chessExptime.pdf]. In RHS, each voter has a Judge Boolean Function, output of which is input to Majority circuit. This Judge Boolean Function can be shown to be EXP-complete by reduction from Chess. Reduction function is as below:
Each Voter can be thought of as simulator of both adversaries in Chess i.e Voter TQBF has two sets of inputs x1,x2,x3,... and y1,y2,y3,... Each xi is a move of adversary1-simulated-by-voter while each yi is a move of adversary2-simulated-by-voter. Voter thus makes both sides of moves and votes for x or y depending on whichever simulation wins. Thus there is a reduction from generalized Chess EXP-complete problem to Voter Judge Boolean Function (special cases of Chess with n constant are PSPACE-complete). Hence RHS is a Majority(n) boolean function composed with EXP-complete Judge Boolean Function (assumption: voters vote in parallel). When P(Good) summation converges to 1(i.e Judge Boolean Function has zero noise and 100% stability existence of which is still an open problem), LHS is an EXP-complete algorithm for RHS which is harder than EXP-complete - it is still quite debatable as to how to affix notation to above RHS - probably it is P/EXP(access to an oracle circuit) or P*EXP(composition).RHS of P(Good) belongs to a family of hardest of boolean functions. [Kabanets - http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~kabanets/papers/thes-double.pdf] describes various classes of hard boolean functions and Minimum Circuit Size Problem [is there a circuit of size at most s for a boolean function f] and also constructs a read-once(each variable occurs once in the branching) branching program hard boolean function [Read-Once Branching Programs - http://www.math.ias.edu/~avi/PUBLICATIONS/MYPAPERS/RWY97/proc.pdf, Bounded Width polysize Branching Programs and non-uniform NC1 - http://www.complexity.ethz.ch/education/Lectures/ComplexityHS10/ScriptChapterTwelve] . In a general setting, RHS of P(Good) summation is m-EXP-complete (staircase exponents). RHS always has a fixed complexity class (PH-complete or EXP-complete or NEXP-complete if RHS is non-deterministically evaluated) while only complexity class of LHS changes due to pseudorandomly chosen Judge Boolean Function. Even Go is EXP-complete which has close to 10^170 possibilities which is greater than chess - same person simulates both sides of adversaries and captures territory by surrounding.

A special case of Complexity of Quantified 3-CNF Boolean Forumlas is analyzed in http://eccc.hpi-web.de/report/2012/059/download/ - if 3CNF quantified boolean formulas of n variables and poly(n) size can be decided in 2^(n-n^(0.5+e)) time deterministically, NEXP is not contained in NC1/poly. This has direct implications for P(Good) majority voting circuit - if LHS is 100% noise stable NC1/poly percolation boolean function circuit and RHS is Quantified 3-CNF QBFs as Judge Boolean Functions decidable in 2^(n-n^(0.5+e)) time then, since NEXP in RHS can not have NC1/poly circuits, RHS P(Good) summation shouldn't be equal to LHS which implies that RHS NEXPTIME Quantified 3-CNF decidable in 2^(n-n^(0.5+e)) time cannot be 100% noise stable. There are other NEXP-complete problems viz., Succinct 3-SAT. The 100% noise stability regime for percolation boolean function is described in [http://arxiv.org/pdf/1102.5761.pdf - page 68]

Depth Hierarchy Theorem ,a recent result in 2015 in http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.03398.pdf proved PH to be infinite relative to some and random oracles i.e PH does not collapse with respect to oracles, which mounts the evidence in favour of non-existence of PH-Complete problems, but does not rule them out.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
53.3 (THEORY- *IMPORTANT* ) Conditions for complexity classes of LHS and RHS of P(Good) summation being equated
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RHS of P(Good) is either PH-complete or EXP-complete as mentioned in 53.2.
LHS of P(Good) is a pseudorandomly chosen Judge Boolean Function while RHS is a huge mixture of judge boolean functions of almost all conceivable complexity classes depending on voter which together make the DC-circuit. LHS thus can belong to any of the complexity classes depending on the pseudorandom choice.

Probability of LHS Judge Boolean Function belonging to a complexity class C with NoiseStability p is =
Probability of LHS PRG choice Judge Boolean Function in complexity class C * Probability of Goodness in terms of NoiseStability of PRG choice =
 c/n * p where c is the number of judge boolean functions in complexity class C and n is the total number of judge boolean functions

When p=1 and c=n LHS is 1 and is a complexity class C algorithm to RHS PH-complete or EXP-complete DC circuit when RHS P(Good) summation in terms of NoiseStabilities also converges to 1. Thus complexity_class(LHS) has a very high probability of being unequal to complexity_class(RHS). This is the perfect boolean function problem (in point 14 above) rephrased in probabilities. This is very tight condition as it requires:
  - boolean function composition in RHS is in some fixed circuit complexity class (PH-complete or EXP-complete) and only LHS complexity class varies depending on pseudorandom choice
  - LHS has to have 100% noise stability
  - RHS has to have 100% noise stability
Thus above conditions are to be satisified for equating complexity classes in LHS and RHS to get a lowerbound result. Also convergence assumes binomial complementary cumulative mass distribution function as mentioned in 14 above which requires equal probabilities of successes for all voters (or equal noise stabilities for all voter boolean functions). Hence voters may have different decision boolean functions but their noise stabilities have to be similar. If this is not the case, P(Good) series becomes a Poisson trial with unequal probabilities.

If LHS and RHS of P(Good) are not equatable, probability of goodness of LHS and RHS can vary independently and have any value. LHS and RHS are equatable only if the probability of goodness (in terms of noise stabilities on both sides) is equal on both sides. (e.g 0.5 and 1). Basically what this means is that LHS is an algorithm as efficient as that of RHS. If a pseudorandom choice judge boolean function has 100% noise stability then such a choice is from the huge set of boolean functions on RHS .This is an assumption based on the fact that any random choice process has to choose from existing set. Also when LHS pseudorandom judge boolean function choice is 100% noise stable, if RHS had LHS as one of its elements it would have forced RHS to be 100% and noise stabilities of all other judge boolean functions in RHS to 0%. Because of this RHS has to exclude LHS pseudorandom choice judge boolean function. That is:
	cardinality(RHS) + cardinality(LHS) = cardinality(Universal set of judge boolean functions) (or)
	cardinality(RHS) + 1 = cardinality(Universal set)
which is the proverbial "one and all". 

Assuming there exists a boolean percolation function with noise stability 100%, voter with such a boolean function could be a pseudorandom choice in LHS and RHS has to exclude this function.

53.4 (THEORY) Variant 1 of Percolation as a Judge boolean function (related to 14 above)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Percolation boolean function returns 1 if there is a left-right crossing event in a path within the Z^2 grid random graph else 0. The definition of percolation is modified slightly as below to obtain a ranking of 2 adversaries:
There are n parameters on which the voter or a judge weighs two adversaries a and b (each take the 2 coordinates in the grid) and scores them as set of ordered pairs (a1,b1),(a2,b2),(a3,b3),...,(an,bn) where each ai is the score given by voter for adversary a on parameter i and each bi is the score given by voter for adversary n on parameter i. These coordinates are plotted on the grid and a left-right traversal of these coordinates is done via a path that covers all of them. At each coordinate, total score summations of ai(s) and bi(s) so far traversed are computed. The boolean function outputs 1 if sum(ai) > sum(bi) favouring adversary a and outputs 0 if sum(ai) < sum(bi) favouring adversary b. This is just a 2 candidate ranking variant of 3-candidate condorcet elections. In terms of circuit complexity, this is an iterated integer addition circuit(in non-uniform NC1) which inputs to a comparator circuit(in AC0 - [Chandra-Stockmeyer-Vishkin] - http://cstheory.com/stockmeyer@sbcglobal.net/csv.pdf) which together make non-uniform NC1 (since AC0 is contained in NC1). Thus this variant of percolation decides based on sum of integral scores than left-right crossing. It always has a left-right crossing and there are no random graph edges.

53.5 (THEORY) Variant 2 of Percolation as a Judge boolean function (related to 14 above)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
53.5.1 Both x and y axes have the criteria common to both adversaries a and b as coordinates.
53.5.2 If adversary a is equal to b for a criterion c, then there is a horizontal left-right edge with probability p.
53.5.3 If adversary b is better than a for criterion c, then there is a vertical edge (down-top) with probability p.
53.5.4 If adversary a is better than b for criterion c, then there is a vertical edge (top-down) with probability p.
-----------------
53.5.5 Example 1:
-----------------
criterion    a    b
c1           5    4 (top-down)
c2           3    5 (down-top)
c3           2    2 (left-right)
c4           4    6 (down-top)
c5           7    8 (down-top)
	--------------------
	    21    25  (a < b)
        --------------------
----------------
53.5.6 Example 2:
----------------
criterion    a    b
c1           2    1 (top-down)
c2           7    2 (top-down)
c3           5    5 (left-right)
c4           3    8 (down-top)
c5           9    7 (top-down)
        ---------------------
            26    23  (a > b)
        ---------------------
53.5.7 Length of each edge is proportional to the difference between score(a) and score(b) at criterion c.
53.5.8 Lemma: a is better than b implies a top-down crossing event and b is better than a implies down-top crossing event.
Proof: If a is better than b in majority of the criteria then the path is more "top-down"-ish due to 53.5.4 (top-left to bottom-right) and if b is better than a then path is more "down-top"-ish due to 53.5.3 (bottom-left to top-right). Thus this formulation of percolation subdivides left-right paths into two classes top-down and down-top and all paths are left-right paths.
53.5.9 Above variant of percolation boolean function returns 1 if path is top-down (a > b) else 0 if path is down-top (a < b).
53.5.10 Previous description is an equivalence reduction of percolation and judging two adversaries.
53.5.11 To differentiate top-down and down-top left-right paths, comparator circuits (constant depth, polysize) and non-uniform NC1 circuit for integer addition of scores are required. Together this is also a non-uniform NC1 circuit (for infinite grid) similar to Variant1 in 53.4.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
53.6 (THEORY) Circuit for Percolation as a Judge Boolean Function
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For an m * m grid with random edges, maximum length of the left-right path is m^2 (traverses all grid cells). Each boolean function is a path that is represented as set of coordinates on grid. If these coordinates form a left-right crossing, then circuit has value 1. Each coordinate on the grid requires 2logm bits. Hence maximum input bits required is m^2 * 2logm = O(m^2*logm). Coordinates are sorted on left coordinate left-right ascending by a Sorting Netwok (e.g Batcher-sortingnetworks, Ajtai-Komlos-Szemeredi-AKS-sortingnetworks, Parallel Bitonic Sort - http://web.mst.edu/~ercal/387/slides/Bitonic-Sort97.pdf). This function outputs, with the sorted coordinates as inputs:
  - 1 if both x-axis coordinate of the leftmost ordered pair is 0 and x-axis coordinate of the rightmost ordered pair is m
  - else 0
which requires comparators. Sorting networks of depth O((logn)^2*n) and size O(n(logn)^2) exist for algorithms like Bitonic sort, Merge sort, Shell sort et.,. AKS sorting network is of O(logn) depth and O(nlogn) size. For n=m^2, AKS sorting network is of O(log(m^2)) depth and O(m^2log(m^2)) size. Thus percolation circuit consists of:
  - Sorting network that sorts the coordinates left-right in NC1 or NC2
  - Comparator circuits in constant depth and polynomial size
which together are in NC. This is non-uniform NC with advice strings as the circuit depends on percolation grid - e.g BP.(NC/log) where advice strings are the grid coordinates and the circuit has bounded error (Noise+delta). [If the left-right paths are classified as top-down and down-top paths for ranking two adversaries (in 53.5 above) additional comparator circuits are required for finding if right coordinate is in top or down half-space. This is by comparing the y-axis of the leftmost and rightmost in sorted ordered pairs and output 1 if y-axis of leftmost lies between m/2 and m and y-axis of rightmost lies between 0 and m/2 (top-down) and output 0 else (down-top).]

Above percolation circuit based on Sorting networks is not optimal for arbitrarily large inputs. As per Noise Stability Regime [page 68 - http://arxiv.org/pdf/1102.5761.pdf - Christophe Garban, Jeffrey E.Steif], for epsilon=o(1/n^2*alpha4), Pr[fn(crossing event sequence)=fn(crossing event sequence with epsilon perturbation)] tends to zero at infinity where alpha4 is the four-arm crossing event probability (paths cross at a point on the percolation random graph creating four arms to the boundary from that point). In terms of fourier expansion coefficients this is: summation(fourier_coeff(S)^2) tending to zero, |S| > n^2*alpha4. Circuit for this arbitrarily large percolation grid would be infinitely huge though can be termed as non-uniform NC sorting-network+comparator and hence a non-uniform circuit for an undecidable problem. Noise stability tending to zero depends not just on input, but on "infinite-input".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
53.7 (THEORY) P/Poly and P(Good) LHS and RHS - Karp-Lipton and Meyer's Theorems
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
P/poly is the circuit class of polynomial size with polynomial advice strings and unrestricted depth. Thus P/poly is non-uniform circuit class.  Hence non-uniform NC is in P/poly. In 53.4, 53.5 and 53.6 example non-uniform NC1 circuits (subject to 100% noise stablility) Percolation boolean function were described. These are in P/poly as non-uniform NC is in P/poly and thus LHS of P(Good) is in P/poly. Hence when LHS and RHS binomial coefficient summations converge to 100% noise stability satisfying the conditions in 53.3, LHS is a P/poly algorithm to RHS EXPTIME DC uniform circuit (because both sides are depth unrestricted). To be precise LHS is an NC/poly circuit. If the advice string is logarithmic size, it is NC/log and there is a known result which states that NP in P/log implies P=NP. For percolation boolean functions with 100% noise stability regime (page 68 - http://arxiv.org/pdf/1102.5761.pdf), if the grid boundaries are the only advice strings, boundary coordinates can be specified in log(N) bits and hence LHS is in NC/log.

If RHS is simply NP (if depth restricted and unlikely for arbitrary number of electorate) then LHS is a P/poly algorithm to RHS NP implying NP is contained in P/poly. By Karp-Lipton theorem NP in P/poly implies that PH collapses to second-level i.e sigma(p,2) and from [Arvind, Vikraman; Köbler, Johannes; Schöning, Uwe; Schuler, Rainer (1995)] NP in P/poly implies AM=MA.

EXPTIME version of this is Meyer's Theorem which states that if EXPTIME is in P/poly (which is the hardest case for RHS of P(good) and can be m-EXPTIME) then EXPTIME = sigma(p,2) \intersection pi(p,2) and EXPTIME=MA. When RHS of P(good) is a DC uniform EXPTIME circuit, P(good) convergence subject to availability of 100% noise stable percolation boolean functions satisfying conditions in 53.3, implies that EXPTIME=MA.

53.8 (THEORY) An example Majority+SAT majority voting circuit, P(Good) convergence and some observations on Noise Stability
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let the number of voters be 8 (=2^3). Each voter has a boolean function of 3 variables - x1,x2 and x3. From Boolean Function Composition, this is defined as Maj(SAT1(x1,x2,x3),SAT2(x1,x2,x3),...,SAT8(x1,x2,x3)). Each variable xi corresponds to a criterion i and xi=1 if and only if the criterion i is satisfied in 2-candidate voting (candidate0 and candidate1). Thus all voters should vote xi=1 if the candidate1 satisfies criterion xi. If some of the voters vote xi=0 even though the candidate1 satisifes criterion xi, then it becomes noise in the boolean function. This composition has exponential size in number of inputs (32 = 2^3 + 3*2^3) = O(n*exp(n))). For negation NOT gates are allowed and it is not necessarily a monotone circuit. If the variables are different for each voter, there are 24 variables and circuit is polynomial in input size - O(n^k).This illustrates the pivotality of noise when voters have a variable in common.

If the RHS doesn't converge to 1 and thus is in BPP and Noise Stability of LHS is 100% (e.g by PRG choice of a percolation function) then LHS is a P/poly algorithm for RHS BPP. This implies BPP is in P/poly , an already known amplification result. Infact this result implies something stronger: Since BPP is in P/poly, even if RHS doesn't converge, there is always a P/poly algorithm in LHS by amplification.

If the RHS has a perfect k-SAT boolean decision function for all voters, size of the circuit is super-polynomial and sub-exponential(if exponential, circuit is DC uniform), P(Good) series converges to 100% and LHS is 100% noise stable Percolation function, then LHS is a P/poly algorithm for RHS NP-complete instance. Special case is when RHS has only one voter - LHS is P/poly (or NC/poly or NC/log) and RHS is NP-complete(assuming k-SAT of RHS voter is 100% noise stable) - and thus there is a P/poly circuit for NP in such a special case. From [Karp-Lipton] (53.7) if NP is in P/poly, PH collapses to second level and AM=MA. If LHS is P/log and RHS is NP, then P=NP. Thus 100% noise stable boolean function in LHS has huge ramifications and the P(Good) summation, its circuit version devour complexity arena in toto and variety of results can be concluded subject to noise stability.

If LHS of P(Good) is in NC/log (Percolation as Judge boolean function) and RHS doesn't converge to 100% (i.e Majority*SAT boolean function composition has < 100% noise stability), LHS is a more efficient NC/log algorithm for RHS BP* hard circuit(e.g RHS is single voter with a SAT judge boolean function without 100% noise stability and thus in BPP). BPP is already known to have P/poly circuits and this implies a better bound that BPP is in NC/log. BPP is not known to have complete problems in which case , NC/log algorithm for RHS BPP-complete problem would imply NC/log = BPP for the single voter RHS with 3-SAT judging function with < 100% noise stability.

Subtlety 1: For single voter in RHS with a 3-SAT voter judge boolean function, RHS is NP-complete from voting complexity standpoint irrespective of noise stability(Goodness of voting). But if noise stability is the criterion and 3-SAT is not noise stable 100%, RHS is a BPP problem. This is already mentioned in point 14 above(2 facets of voting - judging hardness and goodness).

Subtlety 2: [Impagliazzo-Wigderson] theorem states that if there exists a decision problem with O(exp(n)) runtime and Omega(exp(n)) circuit size, then P=BPP. P(Good) RHS being a DC uniform circuit can have exponential size if variables are common across voter judge boolean functions, but is questionable if it is a decision problem of runtime O(exp(n)) - for m-EXPTIME circuits this bound could be O(staircase_exp(n)).

NC/log circuits can be made into a uniform circuits by hardwiring advice strings which are logarithmic size. There are 2^(log(n)) = n advice strings possible for NC/log circuit with O(logn) depth and O(n^k) size. The n advice strings are added as hardwired gates into NC/log circuit which doesnot alter the polynomial size of the circuit. Due to this NC/log is in NC and hence in P. For NC/log LHS with 100% noise stability, if RHS is BPP-complete with < 100% noise stability, LHS is NC/log algorithm for BPP-complete problem (or) BPP is in NC/log and hence in P. But P is in BPP. Together this implies P=BPP if LHS is NC/log and RHS is a BPP-complete majority voting circuit(special case: one voter with less than 100% noise stability and 3-SAT boolean function). This leads to the question: Is there a 3-SAT voter judge boolean function with 100% noise stability? Is percolation with 100% noise stability regime reducible to 3-SAT? If yes, then LHS [P/log, NC/log or P/poly] percolation boolean function with 100% noise stability solves RHS NP-complete problem and hence NP is in P/poly, PH collapses to second level and AM=MA (or) NP is in [P/log, NC/log] and P=NP.

53.10 (THEORY) Dictatorship, k-juntas testing and P(Good) circuit - simulation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LHS of P(Good) is a pseudorandom choice judge boolean function. It has to be tested for dictatorship and k-junta property. This step adds to
the hardness of LHS. What is the probability of LHS pseudorandom choice being a dictator or k-junta boolean function? This probability is independent of Goodness probability of LHS which is the noise stability. If the size of the population is n and k out of n are having dictators or k-juntas as judge boolean functions, probability of LHS being dictator or k-juntas is k/n. Following steps are required:
	- PRG Choice outputs a Judge boolean function candidate for LHS.
	- Dictatorship or k-juntas testing algorithm is executed for this candidate PRG choice.
Expected number of steps required for choosing a dictator via PRG is arrived at by Bernoulli trial. Repeated PRG choices are made and property tested for dictatorship and k-juntas. Probability of PRG choice being a dictator is k/n. Probability p(t) that after t trials a dictator or k-juntas is found:
p(t) = (1-k/n)^(t-1)(k/n) = (n-k)^(t-1) * k/n^t

If t is the random variable, expectation of t is:
E(t) = sigma(t*p(t)) = sigma((n-k)^(t-1)*tk/n^t)

For a property testing algorithm running in O(q), time required in finding a dictator or k-juntas is O(q*sigma((n-k)^(t-1)*tk/n^t))

For k=0:
	E(t) = 0
For k=1:
	E(t) = sigma((n-1)^(t-1) * t/n^t) = 1/n + (n-1)*2/n^2 + (n-1)^2*3/n^3 + ...
	     < 1/n + 2n/n^2 + 3n^2/n^3 + ...
	     = 1+2+3+...+n/n
             = n(n+1)/2n
	     = (n+1)/2
Thus to find one dictator approximately (n+1)/2 PRG expected choices are required. Above is not necessarily an exact process by which LHS arises but just a simulation of one special scenario.

[Axiomatically k shouldn't be greater than 1 i.e there shouldn't be more than one dictator or juntas. Philosophical proof of this is by contradiction. Every element in a population set is subservient to a dictator by definition. The meaning of "dictator" here is global uniqueness for all voters and not locally unique to a voter boolean function. If there are 2 dictators population-wide, this definition is violated.]

(THEORY-*IMPORTANT*) 53.11 Hastad-Linial-Mansour-Nisan (HLMN) Theorem and Noise Stable boolean functions - Denoisification 1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hastad-Linial-Mansour-Nisan Theorem states that for a boolean function f:{0,1}^n->{0,1} computed by circuit of size < s and depth < d, if the
fourier coefficients for large S are epsilon-concentrated:
	sigma(fourier_coeff(S)^2) < epsilon for |S| > t where t = O((log s/epsilon)^(1/d-1)).
Above implies that:
	t = O(log s/epsilon)^(d-1) = k*(log s/epsilon)^(d-1) for some constant k.
	(t/k)^(1/d-1) = log(s/epsilon)
	s = epsilon*2^((t/k)^1/(d-1))
For a noisy boolean function f with rho probability of flip, the noise operator T is applied to the Fourier expansion of f:
	T(f) = sigma(rho^|S|*fourier_coeff(S)*parity(S)) for S in [n] and each Fourier coefficient of T(f) = rho^|S|*fourier_coeff(S)
From HLMN theorem, applying noise operator above (this needs to be verified) to noisy boolean function circuit Fourier spectrum:
	if sigma([rho^|S|*fourier_coeff(S)]^2) <= epsilon, |S| > t where t=O((log s/epsilon)^(d-1)),
	size s = sigma([rho^|S|*fourier_coeff(S)]^2)*2^[(t/k)^1/(d-1)] substituting for epsilon and |S| > t.
	Thus size of the circuit exponentially depends on t - size of parity sets S in [n] - |S| - which can have maximum value of n(number of inputs).

If f is 100% noise stable, from Plancherel theorem:
	sigma(rho^|S|*f(S)^2) = 1, S in [n]
Stability can be written as:
	sigma_S_<_t(rho^|S|*f(S)^2) + sigma_S_>=_t(rho^|S|*f(S)^2) = 1
	[1 - sigma_S_<=_t(rho^|S|*f(S)^2)] = sigma_S_>_t(rho^|S|*f(S)^2)
Since rho < 1:
	epsilon = sigma_S_>_t_((rho^|S|*f(S))^2) < epsilon_stable = sigma_S_>_t_(rho^|S|*f(S)^2) , |S| > t
	epsilon_stable can also be written as = sigma_S_<_t_(1-rho^|S|*f(S)^2), |S| < t

	s = sigma[f(S)^2] * 2^(t/k)^1/(d-1)) , t=O((log s/epsilon)^(d-1)), |S| > t
	s_stable = [1-sigma_S_<_t(rho^|S|*f(S)^2)]*2^((t/k)^1/(d-1))  , t=O((log s_stable/epsilon_stable)^(d-1)), |S| < t
	(or)
	s_stable = sigma(rho^|S|*[fourier_coeff(S)]^2)*2^[(t/k)^1/(d-1)] , t=O((log s_stable/epsilon_stable)^(d-1)), |S| > t.
s_stable is the size of the 100% noise stable circuit for f.
From above, t with noise operator is:
	t(noise_operator)=O(log s/sigma(rho^|S|*f(S)^2)), |S| > t (or)
	t(noise_operator)=O(log s/(1-sigma_S_<_t(rho^|S|*f(S)^2))), |S| < t
which is substituted for t in s_stable above and t without noise operator is:
	t=O(log s/sigma(f(S)^2)), |S| > t
which implies that t(noise_operator) > t since denominator summation of fourier coefficients is attenuated by rho^|S| i.e the lowerbound of t in exponent for size increases due to noise operator. This should be the case for both expressions of s_stable above using Plancherel version of stability. This has strong relation to non-uniformity as rho is set of pseudorandom number strings for flip corresponding to values of rho where stability=1 which are advice strings to the circuit. The exponent t(noise_separator) increases as rho in denominator of log(s/epsilon_stable) increases - correlation due to random flip increases - implying that circuit size depends on increased lowerbound for log(s/epsilon_stable) which is a logarithmic increase in exponent that becomes a polynomial increase in size (because of 2^log()). Thus 100% stability requires polynomial increase in circuit size which implies a P/poly circuit for 100% noise stability. For example, if LHS of P(Good) has Percolation circuit in P/Poly, with polynomial increase in size 100% noise stability can be obtained. If LHS of P(Good) has percolation circuit in NC/poly, polynomial increase in size for 100% noise stability would still be in NC/poly, with additional gates adding to depth with bounded fanin. Moreover, from (53.8), an LHS with 100% noise-stable NC/poly circuit (if percolation is in NC/poly and not P/poly) for an RHS BPP-complete (i.e RHS binomial summation need not converge with 100% noise stability) means BPP is in P and P=BPP.

*Implication 1 of above: If RHS is in BPP (e.g a 3-SAT voter judge boolean function circuit with < 100% noise stability or bounded error) with polynomial size additional gates, it becomes 100% noise stable i.e a BPP circuit becomes NP-complete instance. But BPP is already known to be in P/poly and hence BPP has polynomial size circuits. Hence size(BPP_circuit) + polynomial size addition for stability is still a polynomial = P/poly circuit which makes RHS to be 100% noise stable NP-complete from <100% BPP problem. This implies NP has P/poly circuits surprisingly and NP in P/poly implies PH collapses to second level sigma(pi,2), and also AM=MA.

*Implication 2 of above: If LHS of P(Good) has BP.(NC/log) circuit due to <100% noise stability, with polynomial size increase it can be derandomized or denoisified to 100% noise stable circuit. NC/log is in P/log. With polynomial size increase P/log is still P/log. If RHS is BPP it can be denoisified as mentioned in Implication 1 to NP-complete instance. Thus both LHS and RHS converge in P(Good) binomial summation and RHS is NP-complete and LHS is P/log. Thus NP is in P/log implying P=NP.

Points 53.4, 53.5, 53.6 and 53.7 describe P/poly, NC/poly and NC/log circuits for Percolation Boolean Functions subject to 100% noise stability regime. Important disclaimer is that above considers only denoisification and just denoisification may not be sufficient to remove errors in BP* circuits. As described in 14 on "Noise Stability and Complexity Class BPP" table of error scenarios, there might be cases where both denoisification(removing errors in column three) and derandomization(removing errors in column two) might be required that could add to the circuit size. But since BPP is in P/poly (Adleman's theorem) this is just another polynomial overhead in size. Thus increase in size due to denoisification + derandomization = poly(n) + poly(n) = poly(n) in P/poly.

Noise sensitive NC/log percolation circuit in LHS of P(Good) is in BP(NC/log) which requires denoisification and derandomization. Is BP(NC/log) in P/log? If yes, this could imply P=NP when RHS is an error-free NP-complete k-SAT instance (denoisified and derandomized BPP). BP(NC/log) can be denoisified with poly(n) additional gates from derivation above from HMLN theorem which makes NC/log to be in P/log. Next step of derandomization is by naive enumeration of all possible pseudorandom advice strings. Assumption here is that length of pseudorandom strings required for derandomizing percolation is log(n) which is sufficient to specify any point on an axis in the percolation grid. If log(n) bit pseudorandom advice is enumerated there are 2^(logn)=n possible pseudorandom strings which is poly(n) addition in circuit size again. P/log circuit is executed for all 2^(logn) psuedorandom strings which makes the total runtime n*poly(n)=poly(n). Thus derandomization takes as input a denoisified P/log circuit , adds poly(n) gates to it and outputs a circuit that has runtime poly(n) with logarithmic advice i.e P/log. This has a strange consequence that NP can have P/log circuits and P=NP (Implication 2) contrary to popular belief if logarithmic advice is valid. Equivalently for error-free , denoisified and derandomized PH-Complete problems in RHS (assuming PH-complete problems exist - from (53.2) above), denoisified and derandomized P/log circuit in LHS implies P=PH - collapse of polynomial hierarchy.

(THEORY-*IMPORTANT*) 53.12 Hastad-Linial-Mansour-Nisan (HLMN) Theorem and Noise Stable boolean functions - Denoisification 2
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Above version derived by rewriting HLMN in terms of s(size) and t(size of fourier basis) is not too appealing. Basically, rate of change of circuit size with respect to noise is required and may not be necessary if denoisification is a subproblem of larger derandomization. It then reduces to the question of how size of circuit increases with derandomization, specifically for BPNC percolation circuits - Since BPP is in P/poly, is BPNC in NC/poly or NC/log.  From Linial-Mansour-Nisan Theorem - Lemma 7 (Main Lemma) - http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/~ehudf/courses/anal09/LMN.pdf - Circuit size and Fourier coefficients are related as:
	For |S| > t, Summation(fourier_coeff(S)^2) <= 2*(Size)*2^(-t^(1/d)/20)
For Noise-operated Fourier Spectra, the summation is augmented with rho(noise operator):
	For |S| > t, Summation(rho^|S|*fourier_coeff(S)^2) <= 2*(Size)*2^(-t^(1/d)/20)
Applying Plancherel theorem and stability=1:
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |	For |S| < t, 1-Summation(rho*fourier_coeff(S)^2) <= 2*(Size)*2^(-t^(1/d)/20)					  |
    |	=> [1-Summation(rho^|S|*fourier_coeff(S)^2)] * 2^((t^(1/d)/20)-1) <= Size 				          |
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
which is the circuit size lowerbound in terms of noise probability and fourier coefficients. As rho increases from 0 to 1, lowerbound for
size decreases, that is, low noise requires high circuit size. Partial Derivative of size bound wrt rho:
    -Summation(fourier_coeff(S)^2)] * 2^((t^(1/d)/20)-1) <= doe(Size)/doe(rho)
which points to exponential - in t and d - decrease in size (because t=O(n) and d=O(function(n)) with linear increase in rho (noise) due to negative sign and vice versa. Consequences of this are significant. Though derandomization could result in polysize circuits, denoisification does not necessarily add poly(n) size and in worst case could be exponential too. For NC circuits, t=O(n) and d=O(polylog(n)) , denoisification results in 2^O(n^(1/polylog(n))) increase in size which is superpolynomial. Stability=1 is the point when LHS and RHS of P(Good) binomial summation converge i.e both sides are equally efficient and are perfect voter boolean functions not affected by input noise. Therefore BPNC can not be denoisified in polynomial circuit size even if it can be derandomized to be in NC with polynomial size (i.e if BPNC is in NC/poly). Thus percolation NC circuit in LHS cannot be made 100% stable with denoisification with mere polynomial size and has superpolynomial size lowerbound. This implies when RHS is also 100% stable circuit size of RHS is atleast superpolynomial. Rephrasing:
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	| P(Good) binomial summation in its circuit version can not have polynomial size circuits 		|
	| when LHS and RHS converge with 100% noise stability.							|
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For example, if LHS is a percolation logdepth circuit and RHS is single voter with 3-SAT NP-complete circuit, when LHS and RHS are both 100% noise stable and derandomized (rho=0):

	LHS circuit size >= O(2^n^(1/polylog(n))) = superpolynomial, quasiexponential lowerbound, depth is polylog(n)
implying LHS percolation circuit could become superpolynomial sized when noise stability is 1 and not in NC despite being logdepth.

	RHS circuit size >= O(2^n^(1/d)) = higher superpolynomial, quasiexponential lowerbound, depth is arbitrary ,could be constant for 3-CNF
and thus LHS and RHS circuits are equally efficient algorithms with differing circuit sizes. As RHS is NP-complete, LHS is size lowerbound for RHS - LHS has lesser superpolynomial size than RHS where d(depth of RHS which could be a constant 3) < polylog(n)(depth of LHS).
[Open question: Does this imply superpolynomial size lowerbounds for NP and thus P != NP]

53.13. (THEORY) Partial Derivative of Circuit size wrt rho (noise probability) - increase in circuit size for Denoisification
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From 53.11 above, size of denoisified circuit from HMLN theorem, and Stability in terms of Fourier coefficients with noise operator is:
	s_stable = [1-sigma_S_<_t(rho^|S|*f(S)^2)]*2^((t/k)^1/(d-1))  , t=O((log s_stable/epsilon_stable)^(d-1)), |S| < t
	(or)
	s_stable = sigma(rho^|S|*[fourier_coeff(S)]^2)*2^[(t/k)^1/(d-1)] , t=O((log s_stable/epsilon_stable)^(d-1)), |S| > t.
Lower bound of exponent increases as sigma(rho^|S|*f(S)^2) decreases in denominator of exponent subject to stability constraint:
	[1 - sigma_S_<=_t(rho^|S|*f(S)^2)] = sigma_S_>_t(rho^|S|*f(S)^2)
which implies that sigma_S>t_(rho^|S|*f(S)^2) decreases when sigma_S<t_(rho^|S|*f(S)^2) increases. This is Consequence of HMLN theorem that t acts as an inflexion point for Fourier spectrum with noise operator - area integral from 0 to t is concentrated greater than area integral from t to n.

Partial derivative of Circuit size wrt to rho can be derived as:
	delta_s/delta_rho = sigma_S>t_(|s|*rho^(|s|-1) * f(S)^2) / (1 - sigma_S<t_(rho^|S|*f(S)^2)) where delta_s is increase in size of circuit with delta_rho increase in noise probability. When rho=0, increase in circuit size is 0 (obvious base case). When rho=1, which is the worst case, increase in circuit size is = sigma_S>t_(|S|*f(S)^2) / f(S)^2 which is upperbounded by n - poly(n) increase in size.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
53.14. (THEORY) Hastad-Linial-Mansour-Nisan Theorem, Circuit size, Noise Stability and BP* classes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Percolation circuit defined previously has:
- Sorting Network for creating path sequentially on grid (NC logdepth and polysize)
- Comparators (Constant depth and polysize) are required for comparing the leftmost and rightmost coordinates.
Together Percolation is in non-uniform NC. This circuit depends on number of points on the left-right path which is poly(n).
Therefore percolation is in NC/poly because size of list of advice strings could be O((n^2)log(n^2)) and it may not have NC/log circuits.
From Linial-Mansour-Nisan Theorem - Lemma 7 (Main Lemma) - http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/~ehudf/courses/anal09/LMN.pdf:
	For |A| > t, Summation(fourier_coeff(A)^2) <= 2*(Size)*2^(-t^(1/d)/20)
With noise operator, noise stability=1 from Plancherel's theorem:
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |	For |S| < t, 1-Summation(rho^|S|*fourier_coeff(S)^2) <= 2*(Size)*2^(-t^(1/d)/20)			          |
    |	Corollary: For |S| > t, Summation(rho^|S|*fourier_coeff(S)^2) <= 2*(Size)*2^(-t^(1/d)/20)   	         	  |
    |	=> [1-Summation(rho^|S|*fourier_coeff(S)^2)] * 2^((t^(1/d)/20)-1) <= Size 					  |
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When denoisified, rho=0 and lowerbound for size:
	[1-(0^0*f(phi)^2+0+0+..)]*2^((t^(1/d)/20)-1) <= size
	[1-f(phi)^2]*2^((t^(1/d)/20)-1) <= size (as all other coefficients vanish)
when t=n, the size is lowerbounded by :
	[1-f(phi)^2]*2^((n^(1/d)/20)-1)
which is superpolynomial. This implies an NC/poly polysize circuit when denoisified becomes O(2^((n^(1/polylog(n)/20)-1) .

From the table that describes relation between Noise and Error(BP* and PP) in 14 previously, it is evident that Noise intersects Error
if following is drawn as a Venn Diagram i.e. Noise stability solves just a fraction of total error, and remaining requires derandomization.
In other words, Noisy circuit could be error-free and Noise-free circuit could have error.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	x				|    f(x) = f(x/e)	|	f(x) != f(x/e) Noise    |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x in L, x/e in L			|	No error	|	Error		        |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x in L, x/e not in L			|       Error		|   No error if f(x)=1,f(x/e)=0 |
					|			|   else Error			|
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x not in L, x/e in L			|       Error		|   No error if f(x)=0,f(x/e)=1 |
					|			|   else Error			|
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x not in L, x/e not in L		|       No error	|      Error			|
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Noise percolation circuit in P(Good) summation converges in noise stability regime:
	lt Pr[f(w(n)) != f(w(n)/e)] = 0, e=1/(alpha4*n^2)
	n -> inf
Infinite f(n) is representable as Non-uniform NC/poly circuit though undecidable because turing machine computing the above limit is not in recursive but recursively enumerable languages.

For a 3-CNFSAT boolean function with noise, size of circuit is lowerbounded as:
     [1-Summation(rho^|S|*fourier_coeff(S)^2)] * 2^((t^(1/d)/20)-1) <= Size , for constant depth d.
For rho=1,
     [1-Summation(fourier_coeff(S)^2)] * 2^((t^(1/d)/20)-1) <= Size , for constant depth d, |S| < t.

Gist of the above:
53.14.1 Size of percolation logdepth circuit (with noise) rho=1:
	(f([n])^2) * 2^(n^(1/polylog(n-1)/20)-1) <= size
53.14.2 Size of depth d circuit (with noise) rho=1:
	(f([n])^2) * 2^((n-1)^(1/d/20)-1) <= size
53.14.3 Size of percolation logdepth circuit (with noise) rho=0:
	(1-f([phi])^2) * 2^(n^(1/polylog(n)/20)-1) <= size, phi is empty set
53.14.4 Size of depth d circuit (with noise) rho=0:
	(1-f([phi])^2) * 2^(n^(1/d/20)-1) <= size, phi is empty set

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
53.15 (THEORY) Special Case of HLMN theorem for PARITY as 3-SAT and counterexample for polynomial circuit size
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From HMLN theorem:
     Summation(fourier_coeff(S)^2) * 2^((t^(1/d)/20)-1) <= Size , for constant depth d, |S| > t.
When t=n-1, fourier series has only coefficient for the parity set that has all variables:
	fourier_coeff([n])^2 * 2^(((n-1)^(1/d)/20)-1) <= size, for constant depth d.
For a circuit of size polynomial (n^k) and depth 3:
	summation(fourier_coeff([n])^2) <= n^k / 2^((t^(1/3)/20)-1).
and for t=n-1:
	fourier_coeff([n])^2 <= n^k / 2^(((n-1)^(1/3)/20)-1).
From definition of fourier coefficients:
	fourier_coeff([n]) = summation(f(x)*(-1)^(parity(xi)))/2^n for all x in {0,1}^n
Maximum of fourier_coeff([n]) occurs when f(x)=1 for (-1)^parity(xi) = 1 and when f(x)=-1 for (-1)^parity(xi) = -1 together summing to 2^n.
	Maximum(fourier_coeff([n])) = 2^n/2^n = 1 (this implies all other fourier coefficients are zero)
Which happens when f(x) is equivalent to Parity function.
An example PARITY as 3-CNFSAT from DIMACS32 XORSAT [Jing Chao Chen - http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0703006] that computes parity of n=3 variables x1,x2,x3 is:
	(x1 V not x2 V not x3) /\ (not x1 V x2 V not x3) /\ (not x1 V not x2 V x3) /\ (x1 V x2 V x3)
Previous PARITY SAT accepts odd parity strings. Complementing variables in each clause makes it accept even parity:
	(not x1 V x2 V x3) /\ (x1 V not x2 V x3) /\ (x1 V x2 V not x3) /\ (not x1 V not x2 V not x3)
Assumption: PARITY as 3-CNFSAT has polynomial size.
PARITY 3-SAT is satisified by odd parity bit strings and is NP-complete because this is search version of parity - it searches for strings that have odd parity. Complementing each clause would make it satisfy even parity bit strings.  This example PARITY as 3-SAT with variables in each clause complemented maximizes the fourier coefficient to 1 at S=[n].For |S| < n by pigeonhole principle if one coefficient at |S|=n is enough to make it 1 others have to be either all zero or cancel out each other. An extension of this 3-CNF for arbitrary n should be recursively obtainable from the above example by XOR-ing with additional variables and simplifying and also by Tseitin Transformation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tseytin_transformation) which converts arbitrary combinatorial logic to CNF.
=>    1^2 <=  n^k / 2^(((n-1)^(1/3)/20)-1) which is a contradiction to assumption (denominator is exponential) that PARITY 3-SAT has polynomial size (n^k) circuits.

From above, for some circuit size of PARITY as 3-CNFSAT, there exists t(=O(n)) such that:
      2^(((t)^(1/3)/20)-1) <=  size / summation(f(S)^2) , |S| > t
      2^(((t)^(1/3)/20)-1) <=  size (for all t < n-1, fourier coefficients of PARITY 3-SAT are 0, and this bound is meaningful only for t=n-1).
i.e for all values of t, circuit size is bounded from below by a quantity exponential in function of n (which could be O(n), W(n) or Theta(n).If this is O(n), might imply a lowerbound by upperbound - reminiscent of Greatest Lower Bound in a Lattice if Complexity Classes form a Lattice). LHS of the inequality can have values of t from 1 to n-1 and only one value of this can be chosen lowerbound. If LHS is not a function of n, it leads to a contradiction that 2 PARITY 3SAT circuits of varying sizes can have constant lowerbound. Also finding Minimum Circuit Size problem is believed to be in NP but not known to be NP-Complete(http://web.cs.iastate.edu/~pavan/papers/mcsp.pdf).
(How can a special case of NP-complete problem have superpolynomial size circuits? Is this a counterexample and thus implies superpolynomial size circuits for all problems in NP and P != NP. Because of this correctness of above counterexample has to be reviewed)

53.16.3 If Percolation is in NC/poly and both LHS and RHS of P(Good) converge to 100% noise stability, does it imply an NC/poly lowerbound for
arbitrary circuit size in RHS? In other words what does it imply when 2 circuits of varying size have equal stability - Do two boolean circuits of equal decision error (NoiseStability + or - delta) with different sizes imply a lowerbound? E.g NC/poly circuit for PH=DC (if PH-complete) circuit implying PH in NC/poly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
53.16.3.1 If equal error (NoiseStability +/- delta) with different circuit sizes implies a lowerbound:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is an inherent conflict between 53.16.1, 53.16.3 which are conditions for polynomial size circuits for NP and 53.16.2 which implies superpolynomial circuit size for a special case of NP-complete 3-SAT problem. This contradiction is resolveable if following is true:
	- LHS of P(Good) is percolation NC/poly circuit in 100% noise stability regime.
	- RHS of P(Good) is non-percolation circuit of arbitrary size (e.g. DC circuit of exponential size , superpolynomial size NP circuit from 53.15 and 53.16.2 etc.,).
	- LHS NC/poly 100% noise stability implies a lowerbound when RHS (e.g superpolynomial size NP circuit from 53.15 and 53.16.2) is also 100% noise stable contradicting superpolynomial size lowerbound for NP from 53.16.2. Contradiction is removed only if RHS of P(Good) is never 100% noise stable and hence LHS is not equatable to RHS i.e P(Good) summation has to be divergent and never converges to 100% while LHS is 100%. Major implications of this divergence are:
	- the individual voter error/stability cannot be uniform 0.5 or 1 across the board for all voters - voters have varied error probabilities.
	- varied stability/sensitivity per voter implies RHS majority voting is Poisson Distribution.
	- for probabilities other than 0.5 and 1, RHS P(good) summation becomes hypergeometric series requiring non-trivial algorithms which might or might not converge.
	- This assumes that RHS does not have a boolean function that is 100% noise stability regime similar to LHS Percolation.
	- Superpolynomial size for NP-complete PARITY3SAT (kind of a promise problem) implies P != NP and P != NP implies either a Poisson distribution or a hypergeometric series that might or might not converge.
In other words a democratic decision making which does not involve percolation is never perfect and thus BKS conjecture has to be true berating majority i.e there exists atleast one function - percolation - stabler than stablest majority.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
53.16.3.2 If equal error (NoiseStability +/- delta) with different circuit sizes doesn't imply a lowerbound:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	- LHS of P(Good) is percolation NC/poly circuit in 100% noise stability regime.
	- RHS of P(Good) is of arbitrary size (e.g. superpolynomial size NP circuit from 53.16.2).
	- LHS NC/poly 100% noise stability doesn't imply a lowerbound when RHS (e.g superpolynomial size NP circuit from 53.16.2) is also 100% noise stable. It doesn't contradict convergence of P(Good) summation to 100%, superpolynomial size lowerbound for NP from 53.16.2 and BKS conjecture has to be trivially true i.e Both LHS and RHS of P(Good) are equally stable.

53.17 (THEORY) Oracle results and P=NP and PH
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From [Baker-Gill-Solovay] there are oracles A and B such that P^A = P^B and P^A != P^B implying natural proofs involving relativizing oracles cannot answer P=NP question. Also PH is shown to be infinite with oracle access recently. Because of this all points in this document avoid oracle arguments and only use fourier series of boolean functions and boolean function compositions for circuit lowerbounds for P(Good) voting circuits.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
53.18 (THEORY) P(Good) circuit special case counterexample in PH collapse
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LHS of P(Good) - a sigma(p,k) hard (could be dictatorial or PRG) circuit with 100% (noise stability +/- delta) (assuming such exists)
RHS of P(Good) - a sigma(p,k+1) hard majority voting circuit with 100% (noise stability +/- delta) (assuming such exists)

If above converging P(good) LHS and RHS imply a lowerbound , LHS sigma(p,k) lowerbounds RHS sigma(p,k+1) implying PH collapses to some level k.
The matrix of noise versus BPP in 53.14 and 14 imply noise and BPP intersect, but if only classes in (sigma(p,k) - BPP) are chosen for voter boolean functions, derandomization is not required and noise stability is sufficient to account for total error. If there is a PH-complete problem, PH collapses to some level,but implication in other direction is not known i.e collapse of PH implying PH-completeness - if both directions are true then this proves non-constructively that there exists a PH-complete problem. Every level k in PH has a QBFSAT(k) problem that is complete for sigma(p,k) class. To prove PH-completeness from PH-collapse, all problems in all PH levels should be reducible to a PH-complete problem i.e all QBFSAT(k) complete problems should be reducible to a QBFSAT(n)-complete problem for k < n. Intuitively this looks obvious because QBFSAT(n) can generalize all other QBFSAT(k) by hardcoding some variables through a random restriction similar to Hastad Switching Lemma.

Equating sigma(p,k) with sigma(p,k+l) is probably the most generic setting for P(Good) circuits discounting arithmetic hierarchy.

Example sigma(p,k)-complete QBFSAT(k) boolean function:
	there exists x1 for all x2 there exists x3 ... QBF1(x1,x2,x3,...,xk)

Example sigma(p,k+1)-complete QBFSAT(k+1) boolean function:
	there exists x1 for all x2 there exists x3 ... QBF2(x1,x2,x3,...,xk,x(k+1))

53.19 (THEORY) Depth Hierarchy Theorem for P(Good) circuits
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Average case Depth Hierarchy Theorem for circuits by [Rossman-Servedio-Tan] - http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.03398 - states that any depth (d-1) circuit that agrees with a boolean function f computed by depth-d circuit on (0.5+o(1)) fraction of all inputs must have exp(n^omega(1/d)) size. This theorem is quite useful in election forecast and approximation where it is difficult to learn a voter boolean function exactly.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
53.20 (THEORY) Ideal Voting Rule
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rousseau] theorem states that an ideal voting rule is the one which maximizes number of votes agreeing with outcome [Theorem 2.33 in http://analysisofbooleanfunctions.org/]. The ideal-ness in this theorem still doesn't imply goodness of voting which measures how "good" is the outcome rather than how "consensual" it is - fact that majority concur on some decision is not sufficient to prove that decision is correct which is measured by noise stability +/- delta. Because of this P(good) summation is quite crucial to measure hardness alongwith goodness.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
53.21 (THEORY) Plancherel's Theorem, Stability polynomial and Lowerbounds in 53.18
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stability polynomial can be applied to QBFSAT(k) and QBFSAT(k+1) in 53.18.

By Plancherel's Theorem, Stability of a boolean function with noise rho is written as polynomial in rho:
	Stability(f) = sigma(rho^|S|*f(S)^2) , S in [n]
which can be equated to 1 to find roots of this polynomial - noise probabilities - where 100% stability occurs.

From HLMN theorem for sigma(p,k)-complete QBFSAT(k):
	sigma(f(A1)^2) <= 2*(M1)*2^(-t1^(1/d1)/20)  , |A1| > t1

From HLMN theorem for sigma(p,k+1)-complete QBFSAT(k+1):
	sigma(f(A2)^2) <= 2*(M2)*2^(-t2^(1/d2)/20) , |A2| > t2

When noise stability is 100%:
	Stability(QBFSAT(k)) = sigma(rho1^|S1|*f(S1)^2) = 1, S1 in [n]
	Stability(QBFSAT(k+1)) = sigma(rho2^|S2|*f(S2)^2) = 1, S2 in [n]
where rho1 and rho2 are variables each in the polynomial for QBFSAT(k) and QBFSAT(k+1). Solving these polynomials gives the points where 100% stability occurs in both QBFSATs. By choosing non-zero, real, positive roots of these polynomials as noise probabilities, 100% stability can be attained for QBFSAT(k) in LHS and QBFSAT(k+1) in RHS. Noise probabilities need not be equal in LHS and RHS. This is not an average case bound but lies as special case somewhere between best case and worst case. If delta due to BPP is ignored, equal stability implies lowerbound - LHS sigma(p,k) lowerbounds RHS sigma(p,k+1) and PH collapses to level k. If collapse implies completeness as mentioned in 53.18 , this suffices to prove existence of a PH-complete problem non-constructively. Thus Stability implying Lowerbound has enormous implications for separation results.

Above deduction on PH collapse and possible PH-completeness contradicts 53.15 counterexample for NP having superpolynomial size circuits and hence P !=NP, because PH-completeness could imply P=PH (when LHS of P(Good) is an [NC/log in P] percolation circuit - unlikely if percolation has only NC/poly circuits - which is 100% stable and RHS is PH-complete and 100% stable) and therefore P=NP. Resolution of this contradiction requires:
	- Equal decision error ( stability +/- delta ) does not imply lowerbound.
	- Roots of sigma(rho^|S|*f(S)^2) - 1 = 0 can only be complex with Re+Im parts and can't be real.
	- sigma(rho^|S|*f(S)^2) - 1 = 0 is zero polynomial where all coefficients are zero.
	- PH-collapse does not imply PH-completeness.

Stability polynomial above with rho as variable can be applied to any circuit to find the noise probabilities where 100% stability is attained without machinery like size and depth hierarchies, if equal stability implies lowerbounds. Indirectly 100% stability implies size bound - when rho=1, Stability polynomial grows and concides with HLMN theorem for circuit size lowerbound as mentioned above.



54(THEORY). Would the following experimental gadget work? It might, but impractical:
A voter gadget spawns itself into liker, disliker and neutral parallel threads on an entity to be judged. The neutral thread gathers inputs from liker and disliker threads and gets a weighted sum on them to classify the entity as "like-able" or "dislike-able". Thus real-world classification or judgement and perception seem mythical. (And how is weightage decided? Can this be using SentiWordNet score?). Theoretically, this is similar to Judge Boolean Functions defined in 53.* above, specifically when a voter decides by interactive proof system adversarial simulation (likes and dislikes are reducible to provers and verifiers) which is EXPTIME-complete. Implementation of this gadget is thus EXPTIME-complete.

55(THEORY). Evocation is a realworld everyday phenomenon - a word reminding of the other. Positive thought chooses the right evocation and a negative thought chooses the negative evocation in the absence of context to disambiguate. For example, for a pessimist "fall" means "falling down" while for an optimist "fall" could mean "windfall or sudden gain". For a pestimist((optimist+pessimist)/2), fall could mean one of the "seasons" or even nothing. Mind sees what it chooses to see. Pessimism and Optimism are probably mathematically definable as accumulated weighted thoughts of past occurrences and any future thought or decision is driven by this "accumulated past" which acts as an implicit "disambiguator". This accumulated past or a Karma is reminiscent of above hypergraph of class stacks. 

56(THEORY). A crude way to automatically disambiguate is to lookup the corresponding class stack and analyze only bounded height of events from the top of the stack. Bounded height would imply analyzing only a small window of the past events. For example, looking up the class stack from top to bottom for limited height of 2 for "fall" might have hyperedges "tree fall, heavy rain fall". Thus automatic disambiguation context could be the tuple of tuples [[tree], [heavy, rain]] gathered from each hyperedge analyzed from top. Then this tuple of tuples has to be weighted to get majority. Alternatively, each tuple in this tuple set, as a random variable, could be assigned a belief potential or a conditional probability of occurrence based on occurrence of other tuples in the set. Thus a Bayesian Belief Network can be constructed and by propagating belief potential, probability of each tuple can be computed. Most disambiguating tuple is the one with high belief propagation output. Alternatively, elements of the set of tuples above can be construed as Observations and the State - the most disambiguating tuple - is Hidden and needs to be measured. Thus a Hidden Markov Model can be built. Emission probabilities for an Observation at a State are to be given as priors - probability of a tuple being observed for a word or "class". Importantly each stack is grown over time and is a candidate for Markov process with the restriction - node at height h is dependent only on node at height (h-1) - height encodes timestamp. (But this makes the inference semi-statistical). Consequently, this gives a Trellis from which a Viterbi path can be extracted. Forward-Backward probabilities can be computed (Either generative or discriminative model can be applied, generative being costlier) using this Markov property and deeming the stack itself as a dynamically grown Hidden Markov Model where the Observations are the tuples(hyperedges) and the hidden state is the document that disambiguates. Using the Forward-Backward algorithm, the State(hyperedge) which maximizes the Probability of ending up in that State is the most disambiguating document hyperedge = argmax [Pr(State(t)=Hyperedge(e) / ObservedTuples(1..t)] i.e The tuple or hyperedge that has highest forward conditional probability in the Trellis transition. This assumes the Hypergraph node stack as a Markov Chain. Moreover, State need not be a hyperedge. State is rather a "meaningful context". As in above example, uttering "fall" would kickoff a Forward-Backward computation on the Hypergraph node class stack for "fall" considering the stack as a Hidden Markov Model and would output the argmax State (which is not limited to hyperedge) as above. (Handwritten illustration at: https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/NotesOnConceptHypergraphHMM_and_ImplicationGraphConvexHulls_2013-12-30.pdf?attredirects=0&d=1). Above assumption that node at height (h-1) implies node at height h is quite experimental and is just to model how the human neuropsycological process of "evocation" works on uttering a word. There is no real-life application to this - an event at height (h-1) need not imply an event at height h.

57(THEORY). Thus Sentiment Mining techniques can be used for the above hypergraph to get the overall sentiment of the hypergraph past. Probably each hyperedge might have to be analyzed for positive or negative sentiment to get grand total. Citation graph maxflow in http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.4458 already gives a SentiWordnet based algorithm to weight each edge of a citation graph. Citations can be generalized as "like" or "dislike" opinions on entities as mentioned above.

58(THEORY). Thus not only documents but also events in human life can be modelled as above hypergraph to get a graphical model of the past and a PsychoProfiling of an individual could be arrived at using Sentiment mining. Thus, item 18 about "AstroPschoAnalysis" is feasible by two parallel paths which converge - Psychoprofiling by above concept or event hypergraph for a human being and equating it with results from Astronomical+Astrological analysis done through String Multiple Sequence Alignment mining.

59. Initial Design Notes for - Mundane Predictive Model:
##################################################################################

- (FEATURE - DONE) DecisionTree, NaiveBayes and SVM classifiers and horoscope encoders are already in the AstroInfer codebase. 
- (FEATURE - DONE) Encode the dataset which might be USGS or NOAA(Science on a Sphere) datasets or anyother dataset available after getting text horos for these using Maitreya's Dreams textclient (AstroInfer version)
- (FEATURE - DONE) Above gives encoded horoscope strings for all classes of mundane events in both Zodiacal and AscendantRelative formats (autogenerated by Python scripts in python-src/)
- (FEATURE - DONE) Above set is a mix of encoded strings for all events which can be classified using one of the classifiers above.
- (FEATURE - DONE) For each class the set of encoded horo strings in that class can be pairwise or multiple-sequence aligned to get the pattern for that class
- (FEATURE - DONE) There are two sets for each class after running the classifiers - one set is AscendantRelative and the other is Zodiacal
- (FEATURE - DONE) The above steps give the mined astronomical patterns for all observed mundane events - Pattern_Mundane_Observed_AscRelative and Pattern_Mundane_Observed_Zodiacal

60. (FEATURE - DONE) Above has implemented a basic Class and Inference Model that was envisaged in 2003. Class is the set-theoretic notion of sets sharing common underlying theme. Using VC Dimension is a way to determine accuracy of how well the dataset is "shattered" by the classes. 

61. (THEORY) Now on to mining the classics for patterns: For all classes of events, running the classifier partitions the rules in a classic into set of rules or patterns for that class. Here again there are two sets for each class - Pattern_Mundane_Classic_AscRelative and Pattern_Mundane_Classic_Zodiacal

62. (THEORY) Thus correlation of the two sets *_Observed_* and *_Classic_* (each set has 2 subsets) for percentage similarity using any known similarity coefficient would unravel any cryptic pattern hidden astronomical datasets for that event and would be a circumstantial and scientific proof of rules in astrological classics with strong theoretical footing and would also bring to light new rules earlier unknown.

63. (THEORY and IMPLEMENTATION) More  importantly, for example, if a non-statistical,astrological model of rainfall is computed based on a classical rule which says that "Venus-Mercury in single sign or Venus-Sun-Mercury in close proximity degrees with Sun in the middle causes copious rainfall" is used as a model, expected output of the model could be "Between 28October2013 and 15December2013 there could be peak monsoon activity in ----- longitude ---- latitude with --- percentage probability". And thus this could be a Medium Range Weather Forecasting tool. A python script that searches the Astronomical Data for mined rules from Sequence Mining of Astronomical Data has been added to python-src/. It uses Maitreya's Dreams Ephemeris text client for getting astronomical data for range of date, time and longitude and latitude. This script prints matching date, time and longitude and latitude when a rule for a weather phenomenon occurs as mined by sequence mining.

64. (FEATURE - DONE-related to 65 and 139) Integrate AstroInfer,USB-md,KingCobra and VIRGO into an approximately intelligent cloud OS platform that not just executes code statically but also dynamically learns from the processes (say through log files, executables, execution times etc., and builds predictive models).
USB-md Design Document: http://sourceforge.net/p/usb-md/code-0/HEAD/tree/USBmd_notes.txt
VIRGO Design Document: http://sourceforge.net/p/virgo-linux/code-0/HEAD/tree/trunk/virgo-docs/VirgoDesign.txt
KingCobra Design Document: http://sourceforge.net/p/kcobra/code-svn/HEAD/tree/KingCobraDesignNotes.txt
This AsFer+USBmd+VIRGO+KingCobra would henceforth be known as "Krishna iResearch Intelligent Cloud OS - NeuronRain "

65. (THEORY and IMPLEMENTATION) Related to point 64 - Software Analytics - source code and logs analytics - related to Program comprehension - point 139 on BigData Analytics has more on this. Recently added VIRGO kernel_analytics module is in a way a software analytics module which reads config file set by the machine learning software after mining the kernel logs and objects. Kernel Analytics VIRGO driver module at present reads key-value pairs written to by the AsFer Machine Learning code from /etc/virgo_kernel_analytics.conf. Optionally, AsFer code can directly modify the kernel tunable parameters learnt by AsFer (https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt) through modprobe or "echo -n ${value} > /sys/module/${modulename}/parameters/${parm}" for existing modules while virgo_kernel_analytics.conf is read for VIRGO specific modules. Graph Isomorphism of Program Slice Dependency Graphs for 2 codebases mentioned in https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/PhDThesisProposal.pdf is also a Software Analytics problem. There are Slicing and Graph Isomorphism tools already available. Recently there has been a SubExponential Time algorithm for GI - [Lazlo Babai]. Kernel Analytics config in filesystem requires reloading. New feature to set the kernel analytics key-value pairs directly from userspace to kernel memory locations dynamically has been added via boost::python C++ and CPython extensions - described in 217.SATURN Program Analysis Framework has been integrated into VIRGO Linux - error logs of SATURN are AsFer analyzable - more on this in 232. SourceForge VIRGO repository does not contain SATURN .db files in saturn_program_analysis/saturn_program_analysis_trees/. They are committed only in GitHub saturn_program_analysis/saturn_program_analysis_trees/ . Spark code computing Cyclomatic Complexity of codebase from SATURN generated .dot files has been committed in python-src/software_analytics/ . This requires VIRGO Linux saturn program analysis driver generated .dot files.

66. (THEORY) Encoding a document with above Hypergraph of Class stack vertices and Hyperedges - This hypergraph of concepts can also be used as a steganographic encoding tool for obfuscating a document (somewhat an encryption of different kind). For example, each document is a hyperedge in this hypergraph of class stack vertices. By choosing a suitable encoding function every concept or a word can be replaced with some element within each class stack vertex. This encoding function chooses some element in each class stack - f(word or concept C1 in a document) = a different word or concept C2 in the class stack vertex that contains C1. This function f has to be one-one and onto so that it is invertible to get the original document. This function can be anything modulo the height of that stack. Thus a plain text meaningful document can encrypt another meaningful hidden document without any ciphertext generation.

69. (FEATURE - Audacity FFT - DONE) Music Pattern Mining - Experimental Idea of previous two points is to mine patterns in discrete data and voice(music for example) samples. Music as an expression of mathematics is widely studied as Musical Set Theory - Transpositions and Inversions (E.g http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_and_mathematics, http://www.ams.org/samplings/feature-column/fcarc-canons, http://www-personal.umd.umich.edu/~tmfiore/1/musictotal.pdf). Items 56,57 and 58 could help mining deep mathematical patterns in classical and other music and as a measure of similarity and creativity. In continuation of 68, following experiment was done on two eastern Indian Classical audio clips having similar raagas:
	69.1 FFT of the two audio files were done by Audacity and frequency domain files were obtained with sampling size of 65536, Hanning Window, Log frequency
	69.2 FFTs of these two have been committed in music_pattern_mining/. Similarity is observed by peak decibel frequency of ~ 500Hz in both FFTs - Similarity criterion here is the strongest frequency in the sample though there could be others like set of prominent frequencies, amplitudes etc.,. Frequencies with low peaks are neglected as noise.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
70-79 (THEORY - EventNet Implementation DONE) EventNet and Theoretical analysis of Logical Time:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

70. In addition to Concept wide hypergraph above, an interesting research could be to create an EventNet or events connected by causation as edge (there is an edge (x,y) if event x causes event y). Each event node in this EventNet is a set of entities that take part in that event and interactions among them.This causation hypergraph if comprehensively constructed could yield insights into apparently unrelated events.This is hypergraph because an event can cause a finite sequence of events one after the other, thereby including all those event vertices. For simplicity,it can be assumed as just a graph. This has some similarities with Feynman Diagrams and Sum-over-histories in theoretical physics.

71. Each event node in the node which is a set as above, can have multiple outcomes and hence cause multiple effects. Outcome of an interaction amongst the elements of an event node is input to the adjacent event node which is also a set. Thus there could be multiple outgoing outcome edges each with a probability. Hence the EventNet is a random, directed, acyclic graph (acyclic assuming future cannot affect past preventing retrocausality). Thus EventNet is nothing but real history laid out as a graph. Hypothetically,  if every event from beginning of the universe is causally connected as above, an indefinite ever growing EventNet is created. 

72. If the EventNet is formulated as a Dynamic Graph with cycles instead of Static Graph as above where there causal edges can be deleted, updated or added, then the above EventNet allows changing the past theoretically though impossible in reality. For example, in an EventNet grown upto present, if a causal edge is added from a present node to past or some causal edge is deleted or updated in the past, then "present" causes "past" with or without cycles in the graph.

73. EventNet can be partitioned into "Past","Present" and "Future" probably by using some MaxFlow-MinCut Algorithms. The Cut of the graph as Flow Network is the "Present" and either side of the Cut is "Past" and "Future".

74. A recreational riddle on the EventNet: Future(Past) = Present. If the Future is modelled as a mathematical function, and if Past is fixed and Present is determined by 100% freewill and can have any value based on whimsical human actions, then is the function Future() well-defined?

75. Conjecture: Undirected version of EventNet is Strongly Connected or there is no event in EventNet without a cause (outgoing edge) or an effect(incoming edge).

76. Events with maximum indegree and outdegree are crucial events that have deep impact in history.

77. Events in each individual entity's existence are subgraphs of universal EventNet. These subgraphs overlap with each other.

78. There is an implicit time ordering in EventNet due to each causation edge. This is a "Logical Clock" similar to Lamport's Clock. In a cloud (e.g VIRGO Linux nodes, KingCobra MAC currency transactions) the EventNet is spread across the nodes and each node might have a subgraph of the giant EventNet. 

79. EventNet can also be viewed as a Bayesian Network.

--------------------------------
80. (THEORY) Mining EventNet for Patterns: 
---------------------------------
As an old saying goes "history repeats itself". Or does it really? Are there cycles of events? Such questions warrant checking the EventNet for cycles. But the above EventNet is acyclic by definition.This probably goes under the item 48 above that models the events as a hypergraph based on classification of events which is different from EventNet altogether. Alternatively, the EventNet nodes which are events with set of partakers and their interactions,can be mined for commonalities amongst them. Thus checking any pair of event nodes separated by a path of few edges (and thus separated in logical time) for common pattern suffices and this recursively continues. 

Frequent Subgraph Mining of above EventNet (i.e whether a subgraph "repeats" with in the supergraph) as mentioned in Graph Search feature above could find patterns in events history.(Reference: Graph growing algorithms in chapter "Graph Mining", Data Mining, Han and Kamber)

There is a striking resemblance of EventNet to sequence mining algorithm CAMLS - a refined Apriori algorithm - (http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~yarongon/papers/camls.dasfaa2010.pdf) which is for mining a sequence of events - each event has intraevent partakers  occurring at different points in time with gaps. EventNet mining is infact a generalization of linear time in CAMLS to distributed logical clock defined as EventNet causation infinite graph above. The topological orderings of EventNet can be mined using CAMLS. Sequence Mining python script that implements Apriori GSP has been added to repository and it can be applied to topologically sorted EventNet graphs as well.

----------------------------
81-86. (THEORY) Fractal nature of events:
-----------------------------
81. Are events self-similar or exhibit fractal nature? This as in item 71, needs mining the event nodes which are sets of partakers for self-similarity. A fractal event is the one which has a cycle and any arbitrary point on the cycle has a cycle attached at that point and so on. An example of fractal event is the Hindu Vedic Calendar that has Major cycles, subcycles, cycles within cycles that occur recursively implying that calendar is self-similar. How to verify if the EventNet graph has a fractal nature or how to prove that a graph is "Fractal" in general? Would it be Ramsey theory again?

82. EventNet is a Partial Order where there may not be edges of causality between some elements. Thus a Topological Sort on this EventNet directed,acyclic graph gives many possible orderings of events. If history of the universe assuming absolute time is formulated as EventNet, then the topological sort does not give a unique ordering of events which is counterintuitive to absolute time.(Is this sufficient to say there is no absolute time?). 

83. EventNet on history of events in the universe is quite similar to Directed Acyclic Graph based Scheduling of tasks with dependencies on parallel computers. Thus universe is akin to a Infinitely Massive Parallel Computer where events are dynamically scheduled with partakers, outcomes and with non-determinism. Even static scheduling is NP-Complete.

84. In the above EventNet, each node which is a set can indeed be a graph also with freewill interactions amongst the set members as edges. This gives a graph G1 with each node being replaced by a graph G2. This is a fractal graph constructed naturally and notions of Outer products or Tensor products or Kronecker products with each entry in adjacency matrix replaced by another adjacency matrix apply. By definition each node can be replaced by different graph.

85. Similar to Implication graphs as Random Growth Graphs, EventNet also qualifies as a Random Growth Network as events happen randomly and new edges are added whenever events happen (with previous Kronecker Tensor model). Rich-Get-Richer paradigm can also hold where nodes with more adjacent nodes are more likely to have future adjacent nodes. (A related notion of Freewill Interactions in http://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/UndecidabilityOfFewNonTrivialQuestions.pdf?attredirects=0 is worth mentioning here). 

86. Regularity Lemma can be used as a tool to test Implication and EventNet Random Growth Graphs - specifically seems to have an application in EventNet Kronecker Graph model above where each node is replaced by a graph and thus can be construed as epsilon-partition of the vertices that differ infinitesimally in density. Each element in the partition is the event.

In addition to USGS data, NOAA Hurricane dataset HURDAT2 has been downloaded and added to repository. Asfer Classifier Preprocessor script has been updated to classify set of articles listed in articlesdataset.txt using NaiveBayesian or DecisionTree Classifiers and training and test set text files are also autogenerated. New parser for NOAA HURDAT2 datset has been added to repository. With this datasets HTML files listed in articlesdataset.txt are classified by either classifiers and segregated into "Event Classes".Each dataset document is of proprietary format and requires parser for its own to parse and autogenerate the date-time-longlat text file.Date-time-longlat data for same "Event Class" will be appended and collated into single Date-time-longlat text file for that "Event Class".

1345. (FEATURE- DONE) commits as on 12 September 2013

2.DateTimeLongLat data for all datasets within an event class (text file) need to be collated into a single asfer.enchoros.<classname>.zodiacal or asfer.enchoros.<classname>.ascrelative. For this a Python script MaitreyaToEncHoroClassified.py has been added to repository that reads the segregated parsed dataset files generated by asfer_dataset_aggregator.sh and invokes maitreya_textclient for all date-time-long-lat data within all parsed datasets for a particular event class - "EventClassDataset_<class>.txt" and also creates autogenerated asfer.enchoros.<class>.zodiacal and asfer.enchoros.<class>.ascrelative encoded files

Extended version of BerkmanSchieberVishkin ANSV algorithm - http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~dany/papers/highly.ps.Z (has some references to NC, its limitations, higly parallelizable - loglog algorithms) - input to this ANSV algorithm is elements in array (of size N) and not number of bits (logN) which is crucial to applying this to merge tree of factorization and proving in NC.

17. Defintions related to PRAM model - http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~tvrdik/2/html/Section2.html - Input to PRAM is N items stored in N memory locations - (For factorization, this directly fits in as the O(N) ~ Pi^2/6 * N coordinate product integers stored in as many locations - for discretized tiles of hyperbola)

18. Reduction from PRAM to NC circuits - http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/theory-bk/theory-bk-sevense6.html#Q1-80006-21 (The SIMULATE_RAM layer in each step is a subcircuit that is abstracted as a node in NC circuit. This subcircuit performs the internal computation of PRAM processor in that NC circuit node at some depth i. The NC circuit is simulated from PRAM model as - depth is equal to PRAM time and size is equal to number of processors.). Thus for Discrete Hyperbolic Factorization, the ANSV PRAM mergetree of polylogdepth is simulated as NC circuit with this reduction. Thus though each array element in ANSV is a logN bit integer, the SIMULATE_RAM abstraction reduces it to a node in NC circuit that processes the input and propagates the output to next step towards root. 

19. Length of input instance in PRAM (n or N) - http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/theory-bk/theory-bk-sevense2.html#Q1-80002-3 - "... When no confusion arises, because of the obvious relationship between the number N of values in the input and the length n of the input, N and n are used interchangeably. ...". For ANSV algorithm, the number N of values in the input array and the length n of the input are the same (N=n) and due to this it runs in polyloglogtime in input size O(loglogN) and with polynomial processors N/loglogN. 

20. Quoted abstract - "... The all nearest smaller values problem is defined as follows. Let A = (a1 ; a2 ; : : : ; an ) be n elements drawn from a totally ordered domain. For each ai , 1 <= i <= n, find the two nearest elements in A that are smaller than ai (if such exists): the left nearest smaller element aj (with j <= i) and the right nearest smaller element ak (with k >= i). We give an O(log log n) time optimal parallel algorithm for the problem on a CRCW PRAM ...". Thus N=n.

21. SIMULATE_RAM subcircuit in point 18 - Number of bits allowed per PRAM cell in PRAM to NC reduction - http://hall.org.ua/halls/wizzard/books2/limits-to-parallel-computation-p-completeness-theory.9780195085914.35897.pdf - pages 33-36 - quoted excerpts - "... Let M be a CREW-PRAM that computes in parallel time t(n) = (log n)^O(1) and processors p(n) = n^O(1) . Then there exists a constant c and a logarithmic space uniform Boolean circuit family, {αn }, such that αn on input x1 , . . . , xn computes output y1,1 , y1,2 , . . . , yi,j , . . . , where yi,j is the value of bit j of shared memory cell i at time t(n), for 1 ≤ i ≤ p(n) ∗ t(n) and 1 ≤ j ≤ c*t(n) ...". Thus number of bits allowed per PRAM memory location is upperbounded by polylogn. For ANSV algorithm underlying the Discrete Hyperbolic Factorization, maximum number of bits per PRAM cell is thus logN where N is the integer to factorize (and maximum number of PRAM cells is  ~ pi^2/6 *N) thereby much below the above polylogN bound for number of bits per PRAM cell for creating a uniform NC circuit from PRAM model.

(THEORY) 90.Some notes on extensions to Integer partitions and Hash Functions 
(https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/IntegerPartitionAndHashFunctions.pdf?attredirects=0)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Riemann sums (discrete approximation of Riemann integral) of all the functions corresponding to the hash functions are same. Thus all such functions form an equivalence class.(Assuming each partition created by the hash functions as a function plot)

2. Hardy-Ramanujan asymptotic bound for partition function p(n) is ~ O(e^(pi*sqrt(0.66*n))/(4*1.732*n) which places a bound on number of hash functions also.(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(number_theory))

3. If m-sized subsets of the above O(m!*e^(sqrt(n))/n) number of hash functions are considered as a (k,u)-universal or (k,u)-independent family of functions(Pr(f(x1)=y1...) < u/m^k,then follwing the notation in the link mentioned above, this m-sized subset family of hash functions follow the Pr(f(x1)=y1 & ...) < u/m^n where n is number of keys and m is the number of values. (m! is for summation over (m,lamda(i)) for all partitions)

4. Thus deriving a bound for number of possible hash functions in terms of number of keys and values could have bearing on almost all hashes including MD5 and SHA.

5. Birthday problem and Balls and Bins problem - Since randomly populating m bins with n balls and probability of people in a congregation to have same birthday are a variant of Integer partitioning and thus hash table bucket chaining, bounds for birthday problem and Chernoff bounds derived for balls and bins could be used for Hash tables also (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem, http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~nickhar/W12/Lecture3Notes.pdf)

6. Restricted partitions which is the special case of integer partitions has some problems which are NP-complete. Money changing problem which is finding number of ways of partitioning a given amount of money with fixed denominations(Frobenius number) is NP-complete(http://citeseer.uark.edu:8080/citeseerx/showciting;jsessionid=92CBF53F1D9823C47F64AAC119D30FC4?cid=3509754, Naoki Abe 1987). Number of partitions with distinct and non-repeating parts follow Roger-Ramanujan identities (2 kinds of generating functions).

7. The special of case of majority voting which involves integer partitions described in https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/IndepthAnalysisOfVariantOfMajorityVotingwithZFAOC_2014.pdf requires a hash function that non-uniformly distributes the keys into hashes so that no two chains are equal in size (to simulate voting patterns without ties between candidates). This is the special case of restricted partitions with distinct and non-repeating parts of which money changing is the special case and finding a single solution is itself NP-complete. 

8. Thus Majority voting can be shown to be NP-complete in 2 ways:
	8.1 by Democracy circuit (Majority with SAT) in http://sourceforge.net/projects/acadpdrafts/files/ImplicationGraphsPGoodEquationAndPNotEqualToNPQuestion_excerpts.pdf/download and https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/PhilosophicalAnalysisOfDemocracyCircuitAndPRGChoice_2014-03-26.pdf
	8.2 by reduction from an NP-hard instance of Restricted Partition problem like Money changing problem for Majority voting with constituencies described in https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/IndepthAnalysisOfVariantOfMajorityVotingwithZFAOC_2014.pdf

9. Infact the above two ways occur in two places in the process of democratic voting: The democracy circuit is needed when a single candidate is elected while the restricted partition in second point is needed in a multi-partisan voting where multiple candidates are voted for.

10. Point 8.2 above requires a restricted partition with distinct non-repeating parts. There are many results on this like Roger-Ramanujan identities, Glaisher theorem and its special case Euler's theorem which equate number of partitions with parts divisible by a constant and distinctiveness of the parts (odd, differing by some constant etc.,). Such a restricted partition is needed for a tiebreaker and hence correspond bijectively to  hash collision chaining.

11. An interesting manifestation of point 10 is that nothing in real-life voting precludes a tie and enforces a restricted partition, with no two candidates getting equal votes, where all voters take decisions independent of one another(voter independence is questionable to some extent if swayed by phenomena like "votebank","herd mentality" etc.,) thereby theoretically invalidating the whole electoral process. 

12. Counting Number of such restricted partitions is a #P-complete problem - https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~deloera/TALKS/denumerant.pdf. 

13. If a Hash table is recursive i.e the chains themselves are hashtables and so on... then this bijectively corresponds to a recurrence relation for partition function (expressing a partition of a higher integer in terms of lower integer).

14. If the hash table chains are alternatively viewed as Compositions of an integer (ordered partitions) then there are 2^(n-1) maximum possible compositions.(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_(number_theory))

15. In the summation over all parts of partitions derived in https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/IntegerPartitionAndHashFunctions.pdf if m==n then it is the composition in point 14 above and thus summation over all parts of partitions is greater than or equal to 2^(n-1) since some permutations might get repeated across partitions. Thus the summation expresses generalized restricted composition(summation_over_all_partitions_of_n((n,lamda(i))>=2^(n-1)).

16. Logarithm of above summation then is equal to (n-1) and thus can be equated to any partition of n. Thus any partition can be written as a series which is the combinatorial function of parts in all individual partitions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(THEORY) 93. Reduction from Money Changing Problem or 0-1 Integer LP to Restricted Partitions with distinct parts
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If the denominations are fixed as 1,2,3,4,5,....,n then the denumerants to be found are from the diaphantine equation:
a1*1 + a2*2 + a3*3 + a4*4 + a5*5 + ...+ an*n
(with ai = 0 or 1). GCD of all ai(s) is 1. Thus Schur's theorem for MCP or Coin Problem applies.
Integet 0-1 LP NP-complete problem can also be reduced to above diophantine format instead of MCP. Finding one such denumerant with
boolean values is then NP-complete and hence finding one partition with distinct non-repeating parts is NP-complete (needed in multipartisan
majority vote).

http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.4458 and http://www.nist.gov/tac/publications/2010/participant.papers/CMI_IIT.proceedings.pdf have been extended for a summary creation algorithm from WordNet subgraphs of Recursive Gloss Overlap by filtering out low degree vertices(https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/DocumentSummarization_using_SpectralGraphTheory_RGOGraph_2014.pdf?attredirects=0&d=1). For undirected graphs there is a notion of k-core of a graph which is an induced subgraph of degree k vertices. Since Wordnet is a directed graph, recently there are measures to measure degeneracy(D-cores - http://www.graphdegeneracy.org/dcores_ICDM_2011.pdf). Graph peeling is a process of removing edges to create a dense subgraph. This can be better visualized using visual wordnet implementations:

(THEORY) 106. Creating a summary graph from EventNet
------------------------------------------------------------------
EventNet graph for historical cause and effect described above can be huge of the order of trillion vertices and edges. To get a summary of the
events might be necessary at times - similar to a document summarization. Summarizing a graph of event cause-effects requires giving importance to most important events in the graph - vertices with high number of degrees (indegrees + outdegrees) . This is nothing but finding k-core of a graph which is a maximal connected subgraph of EventNet where every vertex is of degree atleast k.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
(FEATURE - DONE) 112. Expirable objects
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Setting expiry to an object is sometimes essential to control updates and access to an object. Example application of this - A JPEG image
should be accessible or displayable for only a finite number of times and after that it has to self-destruct. Though doing this in C++ is 
straightforward with operator overloading, in C it looks non-trivial. Presently only C++ implementation is added to repository.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(FEATURE- DONE) 113. Commits as on 11 November 2014 - Expirable template class implementation 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Similar to weak_ptr and shared_ptr, a generic datatype that wraps any datatype and sets an expiry count to it has been added to repository 
in cpp-src/expirable/ . For example, a bitmap or a JPEG image can be wrapped in expirable container and it can be access-controlled. 
If expiry count is 1, the object (an image for example) can be written to or displayed only once and thus a singleton.  Presently this is 
only for rvalues. Implementing for lvalues (just a usage without assignment should be able to expire an object) seems to be a hurdle as 
there is no operator overloading available for lvalues - i.e there is no "access" operator to overload. This might be needed for KingCobra
MAC electronic money also.(std::move() copy-by-move instead of a std::swap() copy-by-swap idiom)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(FEATURE- DONE) 114. Commits as on 12 November 2014 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Expirable template in asferexpirable.h has been updated with 2 operator=()

Initial implementation for EventNet:
-----------------------------------
1. EventNet python script has inputs from two text files - EventNetEdges.txt and EventNetVertices.txt - which define the event vertices and the causations amongst them with partakers in each event node
2. This uses GraphViz (that in turn writes a dot file) and python-graph+gv packages
3. GraphViz writes to EventNet.graphviz.pdf and EventNet.gv.png rendered and visualized graph files.
4. Above text files are disk-stored and can be grown infinitely.
5. EventNetVertices.txt has the format:
        <event vertex> - <csv of partakers in the event vertex>
   EventNetEdges.txt has the format:
        <ordered pairs of vertices for each causation edge>
6. Topological Sorting of EventNet using python-graph algorithms package

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(THEORY) 123. EventNet - partakers of events and an application of EventNet to a related problem
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Event vertices have partakers of event as defined in 122. Point 84-86 previously defined EventNet as
a fractal graph tensor where each vertex is a graph or partakers. Alternative formulation of this is
where the partakers are just key words or persons in that event. For example, a fictitious story can be translated into a giant EventNet where each vertex is an event with corresponding partakers in it. It could be difficult to find edges among the partakers (Ideally the edges are conversations among the partakers of an event specific to this example). As an approximation, the partakers could be simply the keywords parsed from that set of conversations. Complexity or connectedness and number of topological orderings possible for this translated EventNet is a measure of elegance.

(FEATURE- DONE) 124. Commits as on 4 December 2014

EventNet - a cloudwide event ordering with unique id implementation
--------------------------------------------------------------------
EventNet has 2 input files for vertices and edges with partakers and 
writes an output file with ordering of the events

Input - EventNetVertices.txt has the format:
       <event vertex> - <csv of partakers> - <tuples of conversations amongst the partakers # separated>
       partakers could be machine id(s) or IP addresses and thread id(s) and the conversations being the        messages to-and-fro across the partakers, which create an IntraEvent Graph of Conversations
       within each event vertex

Input - EventNetEdges.txt has the format:
       <event vertex1, event vertex2>

Output - EventNetOrdering.txt has the format:
       <index in chronologically ascending order> - <event id>

EventNet script thus is run in a central node which has the input files above that is
updated by all the nodes in cloud. Outgoing edge from an event vertex has partakers from multiple
events and thus is an outcome of the event. If the input files are split and stored in multiple cloud
nodes, the topological sorts for multiple input files have to be merged to create a single cloudwide
ordering. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(THEORY) 125. Massive EventNet computation 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each conversation of the events needs to create a log message that is sent to the EventNet service
which updates the input vertices and edges files. The python EventNet script run optionally on a hadoop
cluster mapreduce recomputes the topological ordering periodically. This is quite tedious a process that can flood the cloud with log messages enabled by config boolean flag or compile time #ifdef.

(THEORY) 127. 2-dimensional random walks for decision making (experimental)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Continued from point 49 above, the psychological process of decision making (in a mental conflict with
two opposing directions) is akin to a game theoretical notion of Nash Equilibrium - where a huge payoff
matrix is constructed for the random walk directions as strategies for the two conflicting decisions. There could be Nash Equilibria where decision1 doesn't gain from changing the random walk direction and decision2 doesn't gain from changing the direction (max(column),max(row)). These equilibria are like a win-win or a dilemma . For that matter this should apply to decision trees as well. Related application of equilibria for epidemic and malware are at: http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/view/8478

129. (THEORY) Draft Updates to https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/CircuitForComputingErrorProbabilityOfMajorityVoting_2014.pdf?attredirects=0&d=1 - P(Good) series computation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For even number of finite population (electorate) the binomial coefficient summation in uniform distribution has an extra coefficient which when summed up tends to zero at infinity. Thus P(Good) series converges to,

	(2^n - nC(n/2))/2^(n+1) = 0.5 - epsilon where epsilon=sqrt(1/(2*n*pi)) limit for which vanishes at infinity

(or) probability of good choice is epsilon less than 50% for finite even number of electorate for uniform distribution - a weird counterintuitive special case. Thus the counterexample for P Vs NP is still valid at infinity if infinite majority is decidable(related to decidability of infinite-candidate condorcet election , May's theorem and Arrow's theorem) . Written notes for this are at: http://sourceforge.net/p/asfer/code/568/tree/python-src/ComplFunction_DHF_PVsNP_Misc_Notes.pdf. What this implies is the LHS is PRG circuit in NC or P while the RHS is a humongous infinite majority+SAT (oracle) circuit - unbounded fan-in constant depth circuit. This then becomes an NP-complete Circuit SAT problem - http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~luca/cs170/notes/lecture22.pdf. 

If this infinite-ness breaches the polynomiality then what is quite puzzling is that RHS becomes a Direct Connect DC circuit equivalent to PH(Polynomial Hierarchy). Quoted excerpts from Arora-Barak for DC uniform circuits:

"... 
6.6
Circuits of exponential size
As noted, every language has circuits of size O(n^2^n ). However, actually finding these circuits may
be difficult— sometimes even undecidable. If we place a uniformity condition on the circuits, that
is, require them to be efficiently computable then the circuit complexity of some languages could
exceed n^2^n . In fact it is possible to give alternative definitions of some familiar complexity classes,
analogous to the definition of P in Theorem 6.7.
Definition 6.28 (DC-Uniform)
Let {C n } n≥1 be a circuit family. We say that it is a Direct Connect uniform (DC uniform) family if,
given hn, ii, we can compute in polynomial time the i th bit of (the representation of) the circuit C n .
More concretely, we use the adjacency matrix representation and hence a family {C n } n∈N is DC
uniform iff the functions SIZE, TYPE and EDGE defined in Remark ?? are computable in polynomial
time.
Note that the circuits may have exponential size, but they have a succinct representation in
terms of a TM which can systematically generate any required node of the circuit in polynomial
time.
Now we give a (yet another) characterization of the class PH, this time as languages computable
by uniform circuit families of bounded depth. We leave it as Exercise 13.

Theorem 6.29
L ∈ P H iff L can be computed by a DC uniform circuit family {C n } that
• uses AND, OR, NOT gates.
O(1)
• has size 2^n
and constant depth (i.e., depth O(1)).
• gates can have unbounded (exponential) fanin.
• the NOT gates appear only at the input level.
If we drop the restriction that the circuits have constant depth, then we obtain exactly EXP
..."

The RHS Majority+SAT circuit has all characteristics satisfying the DC-uniformity in the theorem above - size can be exponential, unbounded fanin, depth is constant (each Voter Circuit SAT CNF is AND of ORs - depth 3) and NOT gates are required only in leaf nodes of the Voter Circuit SAT. Thus the counterexample could imply very,very importantly that P could be equal to PH or EXP (P=PH or P=EXP based on depth restricted or unrestricted) in infinite or exponential case respectively - could have tumultuous ramifications for complexity theory as a whole as it goes beyond P=NP question - for perfect voter scenario described in point 133 - all circumstantial evidences above point to this. 

It is not necessary that per voter SAT is same for all voters. Each voter can have unrestricted depth SAT clauses (in real world ,each voter decides on his-her own volition and depth of their SAT circuits can vary based on complexity of per-individual decision making algorithm) - due to which RHS zero-error DC circuit need not be in PH but in EXP.

even if a BQP algorithm is used in voting outside the purview of PH but in EXP, it doesn't change the above unless:
 - perfection is impossible i.e there cannot be zero-error processes in the universe
 - DC-circuit is not drawable (or undecidable if it can be constructed)
 - infinite majority is undecidable (so circuit is DC non-uniform and not DC-uniform)
 - the voter CNF can only be 2-SAT (which is highly unlikely) and not k-SAT or 3-SAT


129.1 Toda's theorem and P(good) circuit above:
------------------------------------------------
PH is contained in P^#P (or) P with #no-of-solutions-to-SAT oracle (Toda's theorem). 
If zero-error Majority+SAT voting DC uniform circuit is in PH then due to LHS=RHS of the P(good) series convergence (in cases of p=0,p=1 and p=0.5 as derived in http://sourceforge.net/p/asfer/code/916/tree/cpp-src/miscellaneous/MajorityVotingErrorProbabilityConvergence.JPG), 
PH collapses(?) to P (quite unbelievably):
LHS Pseudorandom choice is in P while RHS Majority+SAT is in PH=DC circuit (restricted depth) or EXP (unrestricted depth)
(i.e there is a P algorithm for PH). 
if P=PH:
  P=PH is in P^#P by Toda's theorem 

if P=EXP:
 P=PH=EXP in P^#P or P=PH=EXP=P^#P (which is a complete collapse)

[p=0.5 is the uniform distribution which is a zero bias space while for other probabilities some bit patterns are less likely - epsilon-bias spaces]


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
130. (THEORY) Counterexample definition for P Vs NP
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Majority Circuit with SAT voter inputs with finite odd number of voters, in uniform distribution
converges to 1/2 same as LHS for pseudorandom choice. Even number of voters is a special case described
previously. Also both LHS and RHS converge to 1 if probability is 1 (without any errors in pseudorandom choice and majority voting) which is counterintuitive in the sense that LHS nonprobabilistically achieves in PTIME what RHS does in NPTIME.

---------------------------------------------------------
131. (THEORY) Infinite majority and SAT+Majority Circuit
---------------------------------------------------------
Infinite version of majority circuit is also a kind of heavy hitters problem for streaming algorithms where majority has to be found in an infinite bitstream of output from majority circuits for voters(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_algorithm#Heavy_hitters). But nonuniform distribution still requires hypergeometric series. Moreover the SAT circuit is NP-complete as the inputs are unknown and is P-Complete only for non-variable gates(Circuit Value Problem). Odd number of electorate does not give rise to above extra coefficient in summation and is directly deducible to 0.5.

----------------------------------------------------------
132. (THEORY) May's Theorem of social choice 
----------------------------------------------------------
May's Theorem: In a two-candidate election with an odd number of voters, majority rule is the only voting system that is anonymous, neutral, and monotone, and that avoids the possibilites of ties. 

May's theorem is 2-candidate analog of Arrow's Theorem for 3-candidate condorcet voting. May's theorem for 2 candidate simple majority voting defines a Group Decision Function which is valued at -1, 0 or 1 (http://www.jmc-berlin.org/new/theorems/MaysTheorem.pdf) for negative, abstention and positive vote for a candidate. For 2 candidates, positive vote for one candidate is negative for the other (entanglement).In the democracy circuit (SAT+Majority) the SAT clauses are kind of Group Decision Functions but with only binary values without any abstention. This is kind of alternative formulation - corollary - for May's theorem. Arrow's theorem does not apply for 2 candidate simple majority voting. May's theorem stipulates the conditions of anonymity,neutrality,decisiveness,monotonicity which should apply to the Majority+SAT circuit decision function as well. Neutrality guarantees that all outcomes are equally probable without bias which might imply that only uniform distribution is allowed in 2 candidate Majority+SAT voting. Thus there is a reduction from May's theorem to SAT+Majority democracy circuit. May's theorem does not apply to ties.This has been generalized to infinite electorate by Mark Fey. Anonymity is secret balloting. Monotonicity is non-decremental (e.g by losing votes a losing candidate is not winner and vice versa).

133. (THEORY) Pseudorandom number generator and Majority voting for choice on a set
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let S be a set of elements with "goodness" attribute for each element. Choice using LHS and RHS on this set is by a PRG and a majority voting circuit with SAT inputs. LHS for pseudorandom choice consists of two steps:
133.1 Accuracy of the PRG - how random or k-wise independent the PRG is - this is usually by construction of a PRG (Blum-Micali, Nisan etc.,) 
133.2 Goodness of chosen element - PRG is used to choose an element from the set - this mimicks the realworld phenomenon of non-democractic social or non-social choices. Nature itself is the PRG or RG in this case. After choice is made, how "good" is the chosen is independent of (133.1). Proof is by contradiction - if it were dependent on PRG used then a distinguisher can discern the PRGs from True Randomness by significant fraction.
133.3 Thus if the set S is 100% perfect - all elements in it are the best - LHS of P(Good) is 1. Similarly the RHS is the majority voting within these "best" elements which can never err (i.e their SAT clauses are all perfect) that converges to 1 by binomial coefficient summation in uniform distribution.

From the aforementioned,it is evident that for a 100% perfect set,both PRG(LHS) and Majority+SAT(RHS) Voting are two choice algorithms of equal outcome but with differing lowerbounds(with p=0.5 both LHS and RHS are in BPP or BPNC,but when p=1 then RHS is NP and LHS is P or NC). The set in toto is a black-box which is not known to the PRG or individual voters who are the constituents of it.

135.1 The standard LP form can be obtained by slack variables (with only equalities) - mentioned as free variables in above - http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-053-optimization-methods-in-management-science-spring-2013/tutorials/MIT15_053S13_tut06.pdf 

135.2 Pseudorandom generator with linear stretch in NC1 - http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mcryan/mfcs01.ps
- ... " The notion of deterministically expanding a short seed into a long string that ... the question of whether strong pseudorandom generators actually exist is a huge ... hardness assumption, that there is a secure pseudorandom generator in NC1 " ... [Kharitonov]

135.3 This space filling algorithm is in NC (using Tygar-Rief) with an assumption that multiplicative inverse problem is almost always not in RNC. 

135.4 Tygar-Rief algorithm outputs n^c bits in parallel (through its PRAM processors) for n=logN for some composite N and is internal to the algorithm. For the sake of disambiguation, the number of bit positions in grid corresponding to the LP is set to Z.  

135.5 Above pseudorandom bits have to be translated into the coordinate positions in the grid which is Z. In other words, pseudorandom bits are split into Z substrings (n^c/logZ = Z) because each coordinate in the grid of size 2^logZ/2 * 2^logZ/2 is notated by the tuple of size(logZ/2, logZ/2)

135.6 Constant c can be suitably chosen as previously to be c = log(Z*logZ)/logn (n need not be equal to Z)

135.7 Either the n^c sized pseudorandom string can be split sequentially into (logZ/2+logZ/2) sized substring coordinate tuples (or) an additional layer of pseudorandomness can be added to output the coordinate tuples by psuedorandomly choosing the start-end of substrings from n^c size string, latter being a 2-phase pseudo-pseudo-random generator

135.8 In both splits above, same coordinate tuple might get repeated - same bit position can be set to 1 more than once. Circumventing this requires a Pseudorandom Permutation which is a bijection where Z substrings do not repeat and map one-one and onto Z coordinates on grid. With this assumption of a PRP all Z coordinates are set to 1 (or) the P-Complete LP is maximized in this special case, in NC.

135.9 There are Z substrings created out of the 2^n^c pseudorandom strings generated by Tygar-Rief Parallel PRG. Hence non-repeating meaningful substrings can be obtained only from Z!/2^n^c fraction of all pseudorandom substrings.

135.10 Maximizing the LP can be reduced to minimizing the collisions (or) repetitive coordinate substrings above thus filling the grid to maximum possible. An NC algorithm to get non-repetitive sequence of coordinates is to add the index of the substring to the each split substring to get the hashed coordinates in the grid. For example in the 2*2 grid, if the parallel PRG outputs 01011100 as the pseudorandom bit string, the substrings are 01, 01, 11 and 00 which has a collision. This is resolved by adding the index binary (0,1,2,3) to corresponding substring left-right or right-left. Thus 01+00, 01+01, 11+10, 00+11 - (001,010,101,011) - are the non-repetitive hashed coordinates. The carryover can be avoided by choosing the PRG output string size. This is a trivial bijection permutation.

135.11 The grid filling can be formulated as a Cellular Automaton of a different kind - by setting or incrementing the 8 neighbour bit positions of a coordinate to 1 while setting or incrementing a coordinate to 1.

135.12 Instead of requiring the non-repetitive coordinate substrings mentioned in (10) supra, the grid filling can be a multi-step algorithm as below which uses the Cellular Automaton mentioned in (11).

------------------------------------
135.13 Cellular Automaton Algorithm:
------------------------------------
(Reference for reductions below: http://cstheory.com/stockmeyer@sbcglobal.net/csv.pdf [Chandra-Stockmeyer-Vishkin])
[http://sourceforge.net/p/asfer/code/HEAD/tree/asfer-docs/AstroInferDesign.txt and 
https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/asfer-github-code/blob/master/asfer-docs/AstroInferDesign.txt ]

The circuits described in [ChandraStockmeyerVishkin] are constant depth circuits [AC0] and thus in [NC1]  (unbounded to bounded fanin logdepth reduction)

From wikipedia - Linear programs are problems that can be expressed in canonical form:
c^T * X
subject to AX <= b 
and X >= 0 

maximize X
subject to AX <= some maximum limit
and X >= 0  

Below Cellular Automaton Monte Carlo NC algorithm for grid filling assumes that:
C=[1,1,1,...1]
A=[1,1,1....1] in the above and the vector of variables X is mapped to the grid - sequentially labelled in ascending from top-left to bottom-right, row-by-row and column-by-column. Though this limits the number of variables to be a square, additional variables can be set to a constant.


Grid cells (or variables in above grid) are initialized to 0.

loop_forever
{
	(135.13.1) Parallel Pseudorandom Generator (Tygar-Rief) outputs bit string which are split into coordinates of grid and corresponding Grid cells are incremented instead of overwriting. This simulates parallel computation in many natural processes viz., rain. This is in NC. This is related to Randomness Extractors - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness_extractor - if rainfall from cloud can be used a natural weak entropy parallel randomness source (or strong?) - predicting which steam particle of a cloud would become a droplet is heavily influenced by the huge number of natural variables - fluid mechanics comes into force and this happens in parallel. Extractor is a stronger notion than Pseudorandom Generator. Extracting parallel random bits can also be done from a fluid mechanical natural processes like turbulent flows.
	(135.13.2) Each grid cell has a constant depth Comparison Circuit that outputs 1 if the grid cell value exceeds 1. This is in AC0(constant-depth, polynomial size).
	(135.13.3) If above Comparison gate outputs 1, then another NC circuit can be constructed that finds the minimum of grid neigbours of a cell (maximum 8 neighbours for each cell in 2-dimensional grid), decrements the central cell value and increments the minimum neighbour cell. This can be done by a sorting circuit defined in [ChandraStockMeyerVishkin]. This simulates a percolation of a viscous fluid that flows from elevation to lowlying and makes even. Each grid cell requires the above comparator and decrement NC circuit.
}

Above can be diagramatically represented as: (for N=a*b cells in grid in parallel)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
		cell(1,1)	..............	   cell(a,b)
		----------------------------------------------	
		PRG in parallel		....	PRG in parallel
		      ||				||
		Comparison 		....	   Comparison
		      ||				||	
	Minimum of 8 neighbours		....	  Minimum of 8 neighbours
		      ||				||
		Increment			    Increment  
		and				    and
		Decrement			    Decrement

135.14 For example, a 3*3 grid is set by pseudorandom coordinate substrings obtained from Parallel PRG (6,7,7,8,9,1,3,3,2) as follows with collisions (grid coordinates numbered from 1-9 from left-to-right and top-to-bottom):
		
		1  1  2
		0  0  1
		2  1  1

Above can be likened to a scenario where a viscous fluid is unevenly spread at random from heavens.
By applying cellular automaton NC circuit algorithm above, grid becomes: (minimizes collisions,maximizes variables and LP)

		1  1  1
		1  1  1
		1  1  1

Above can be likened to a scenario where each 8-neighbour grid cell underneath computes the evened-out cellular automaton in parallel. Size of the NC circuit is polynomial in LP variables n and is constant depth as the neighbours are constant (ChandraStockmeyerVishkin)
Thus there are 2 NC + 1 AC circuits which together maximize the special case of P-Complete LP instance without simplex where each grid coordinate is an LP variable. 135.13.1 (randomly strewn fluid) is independent of 135.13.2 and 135.13.3 (percolation of the fluid). This is both a Monte-Carlo and Las Vegas algorithm. The Parallel coordinate generation with Tyger-Reif Parallel PRG is Monte Carlo Simulation where as there is a guaranteed outcome with 100% possibility due to Comparison and Increment-Decrement circuits.

135.16 A related algorithm - filling a square with infinitely many inscribed circles
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let S be a square of unit area. This square is filled with infinitely many circles of varying radii. This
can be expressed in terms of geometric equations for circle - x(i)^2 +y(i)^2 = r(i)^2. Each (x(i),y(i)) is a coordinate on the circle of radius r(i). Since x(i) and y(i) are < 1, let x(i) = 1/a(i) and y(i) = 1/b(i) for some integers a(i) and b(i). At infinity the square is filled with above infinite number of circles that cover the unit area (has some analogies to set cover and VC-dimension-shattering). This can be written as the infinite summation pi*(1/a(1)^2 + 1/b(1)^2 + 1/a(2)^2 + 1/b(2)^2 + ....) = 1 (or sum of areas of all circles equals the unit area of square). Thus this equation is a quadratic program instead of a linear program. This is extensible to higher dimensions also (filling a hypercube with infinite number of n-spheres). For example, in 3 dimensions, set of spherical bubbles of varying radii covers the entire cube.

135.17 Above grid can be alternatively formulated as a Voronoi Diagram where Parallel PRG randomly sets multiple points on the plane and a tesselation of the plane covers these points. Instead of squares a Delaunay Triangulation is obtained from the dual of the Voronoi diagram.

139.1 (DONE) As mentioned in commit notes(13February2015) below, new multipurpose Java Hadoop MapReduce 
code has been added to a bigdata_analytics/ directory. At present it computes the frequencies of astronomical entities in the MinedRulesFromDatasets textfile obtained from clustering+LCS. 

139.2 VIRGO Linux Kernel has following design choices to interface with the machine learning code 
in AsFer :
	139.2.1 (DONE) the kernel module does an upcall to userspace asfer code - already this facility exists in VIRGO linux drivers
	139.2.2 (INITIAL VIRGO COMMITS - DONE) the analytics subsystem creates a policy config file /etc/virgo_kernel_analytics.conf having key-value pairs for each config variable by mining the datasets with classification+clustering+any-hadoop-based-analytics. This is read by a VIRGO Linux kernel module - kernel_analytics - with VFS calls and sets(and exports symbols) the runtime config variables that indirectly determine the kernel behaviour. These exported analytics variables can be read by other interested kernel modules in VIRGO Linux, USB-md and KingCobra (and obviously mainline kernel itself). An example Apache Spark python script which mines the most frequent IP address from Uncomplicated Fire Wall and some device driver info from logs in /var/log/kern.log and /var/log/udev which can be set as a config key-value in /etc/virgo_kernel_analytics.conf has been added to AsFer repository. Dynamic setting of kernel analytics key-value pairs has been implemented with Boost::Python C++ and CPython C Extensions which obviates /etc/virgo_kernel_analytics.conf reload.
	139.2.3 (INITIAL ASFER COMMITS - DONE) kernel module implements the machine learning algorithm in C (C++ in kernel is not preferable - http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/c++/linus) which doesn't reuse existing code and hence less attractive. Despite this caveat, a PoC Boost::Python C++ invocation of VIRGO memory system calls works - VIRGO linux has been made an extension Python C++ and C module which is invoked from Python userspace. Commits for this are described in 217. This is a tradeoff between pure C kernelspace and pure python/C/C++ userspace.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Python class that implements Apriori GSP algorithm for mining frequent subsequences in ordered sequences
dataset has been added to repository. Though exponential, together with Longest Common Subsequence, Apriori GSP gives a near accurate subsequences - befitting trend of the dataset. For example the logs added to repository print the candidate support after 5 iterations (which can be modified) for asfer.enchoros dataset thereby eliciting a pattern in astronomical objects.

148. An example Class Association Rule Learnt from Sequence Mining:
--------------------------------------------------------------
For length 6 most frequent subsequences in earthquake astronomical data from 1900 are: ('conjoinedplanets',frequency)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------
indices for planets:
-------------------
 * 0 - for unoccupied
 * 1 - Sun
 * 2 - Moon
 * 3 - Mars
 * 4 - Mercury
 * 5 - Jupiter
 * 6 - Venus
 * 7 - Saturn
 * 8 - Rahu
 * 9 - Ketu

Some inferences can be made from above:
-------------------------------------- 
By choosing the creamy layer of items with support > 30 (out of 313 historic events) - ~10%:
[('14', 121), ('46', 66), ('56', 51), ('13', 51), ('34', 42), ('45', 36), ('9a', 33), ('79', 31), ('24', 30), ('16', 30)]

Above implies that:
-------------------
Earthquakes occur most likely when, following happen - in descending order of frequencies:
- Sun+Mercury (very common)
- Mercury+Venus 
- Jupiter+Venus
- Sun+Mars
- Mars+Mercury
- Mercury+Jupiter
- Ketu is in Ascendant
- Saturn+Ketu
- Moon+Mercury
- Sun+Venus

Machine Learnt pattern above strikingly coincides with some combinations in Brihat Samhita (Role of Mars, Nodes, and 2 heavy planets, Mercury-Venus duo's role in weather vagaries) and also shows some new astronomical patterns (Sun+Mars and Jupiter+Venus as major contributors). Above technique is purely astronomical and scientific with no assumptions on astrology.

Some recent major intensity earthquakes having above sequence mined astronomical conjunctions :
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sendai Earthquake - 11 March 2011 14:46 - Sun+Mars in Aquarius, Mercury+Jupiter in Pisces
Nepal Earthquake - 25 April 2015 11:56 - Sun+Mars+Mercury in Aries 
Chile Earthquake - 16 September 2015 22:55 -  Sun+Mars+Jupiter in Leo 
All three have Sun+Mars coincidentally.

A Graph Search NetworkX+MatPlotLib Visualizer for WordNet has been implemented in python and has been added to repository. This is an initial code and more algorithms to mine relationships within a text data would be added using WordNet as ontology - with some similarities to WordNet definition subgraph obtained in http://sourceforge.net/p/asfer/code/HEAD/tree/python-src/InterviewAlgorithm/InterviewAlgorithmWithIntrinisicMerit.py.

Updated WordNet Visualizer with:
- bidirectional edges
- graph datastructure changed to dictionary mapping a node to a list of nodes (multigraph)
- With these the connectivity has increased manifold as shown by gloss overlap
- the graph nodes are simply words or first element of lemma names of the synset
- more networkx drawing layout options have been added

Added code for:
- removing self-loops in the WordNet subgraph
- for computing core number of each node (maximum k such that node is part of k-core decomposition)

In the input example, nodes "India" and "China" have core numbers 15 and 13 respectively which readily classify the document to belong to
class "India and China". Thus a new unsupervised classifier is obtained based on node degrees.

- added sorting the core numbers descending and printing the top 10% core numbers which are prospective classes the document could belong to.
This is a new unsupervised text classification algorithm and is based on recursive gloss overlap algorithm in http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.4458 and
http://www.nist.gov/tac/publications/2010/participant.papers/CMI_IIT.proceedings.pdf. A major feature of this algorithm is that it is more precise in finding the class of a document as intrinsic merit is computed by mapping a text to subgraph of wordnet, than conventional text classification and clustering based on distance metrics and training data.

An interesting research was done on the wordnet subgraph obtained by Recursive Gloss Overlap algorithm:
- PageRank computation for the WordNet subgraph was added from NetworkX library. This is probably one of the first applications of PageRank to
a graph other than web link graph.
- The objective was to find the most popular word in the subgraph obtained by the Random Walk Markov Model till it stabilized (PageRank)
- The resultant word with maximum pagerank remarkably coincides with the most probable class of the document and is almost similar in
ranking to core numbers of nodes ranked descending.
- Some random blog text was used.
- Above was mentioned as a theoretical statement in 5.12 of http://www.nist.gov/tac/publications/2010/participant.papers/CMI_IIT.proceedings.pdf

A primitive text generation from the definition graph has been implemented by:
- computing the k-core of the graph above certain degree k so that the core is dense
- each edge is mapped to a relation - at present "has" , "is in" are the only 2 relations (more could be added based on
hypernyms)
- Each edge is output as "X <relation> Y"
- Above gives a nucleus text extracted from the original document
- It implements the theory mentioned in: https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/DocumentSummarization_using_SpectralGraphTheory_RGOGraph_2014.pdf?attredirects=0&d=1

Hypernyms/Hyponyms based sentence construction added to WordNet Visualizer. The core-number and pagerank based classifier was tested with more inputs. The accuracy and relevance of the word node with topmost core number and pagerank for RGO graph looks to be better than the traditional supervised and unsupervised classifiers/clusterers. The name of the class is inferred automatically without any training inputs or distance metrics based only on density of k-core subgraphs.

Updated the Visualizer to print the WordNet closure of hypernyms and hyponyms to generate a blown-up huge sentence. The closure() operator
uncovers new vertices and edges in the definition graph (strict supergraph of RGO graph) and it is a mathematically generated sentence
(similar to first order logic and functional programming compositionality) and mimicks an ideal human-thinking process (psychological process of evocation which is complete closure in human brain on a word utterance).

Added code for computing recursive composition of lambda functions over the RGO graph relations(edges):
- For this the Depth First Search Tree of the graph is computed with NetworkX
- The lambda function is created for each edge
- Composition is done by concatenating a recursive parenthesisation string of lambda expressions:
	for each DFS edge:
		Composed_at_tplus1 = Composed_at_t(lambda <edge>) 
- DFS is chosen as it mimicks a function invocation stack
- Lambda composition closure on the Recursive Gloss Overlap graph has been rewritten to create a huge lambda composition string with parentheses. Also two new lambda function relations have been introduced - "subinstance of" and "superinstance of". These are at present most likely do
not exist in WordNet parlance, because the Recursive Gloss OVerlap algorithm grows a graph recursively from WordNet Synset definition tokenization.
- Thus a tree is built which is made into a graph by pruning duplicate edges and word vertices. WordNet graph does not have a depth. RGO algorithm adds one more dimension to WordNet by defining above relations. These are different from hyper/hypo-nymns. During recursive gloss overlap, if Y is in Synset definition of X, Y is " subinstance of" X and X is "superinstance of" Y.
- Thus RGO in a way adds new hierarchical recursive relationships to WordNet based on Synset definition.
- The lambda composition obtained above is a mathematical or lambda calculus representation of a text document - Natural Language reduced to Lambda calculus compositionality operator.

New Sentiment Analyzer script has been added to repository:
- This script adds to WordNet Visualizer with Sentiment analysis using SentiWordNet from NLTK corpus
- added a Simple Sentiment Analysis function that tokenizes the text and sums up positivity and negativity score
- A non-trivial Sentiment Analysis based on Recursive Gloss Overlap graph - selects top vertices with high core numbers
and elicits the positivity and negativity of those vertex words.
- Above is intuitive as cores of the graph are nuclei centering the document and the sentiments of the vertices of those cores
are important which decide the sentiment of the whole document.
- Analogy: Document is akin to an atom and the Recursive Gloss Overlap does a nuclear fission to extricate the inner strucure of a document
(subatomic particles are the vertices and forces are edges)
- Instead of core numbers, page_rank can also be applied (It is intriguing to see that classes obtained from core_numbers 
and page_rank coincide to large extent) and it is not unusual to classify a document in more than one class (as it is more realistic).

Above script can be used for any text including social media and can be invoked as a utility from SocialNetworkAnalysis_<brand> scripts.
Microblogging tweets are more crisp and "emotionally precise" i.e. extempore - convey instantaneous sentiment (without much of a preparation)

153. (FEATURE - THEORY - Minimum Implementation DONE) Sentiment Analysis as lambda function composition of the Recursive Gloss Overlap WordNet subgraph
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SentiWordNet based scoring of the tweets and texts have some false positives and negatives. But the lambda composition of the
Recursive Gloss Overlap graph is done by depth-first-search - set of composition trees which overlap. If each edge is replaced by
a function of sentiment scores of two vertex words, then lambda composition performed over the graph is a better representation of sentiment
of the document. This is at present a conjecture only. An implementation of this has been added to SentimentAnalyzer.py by doing a Belief
Propagation of a sentiment potential in the Recursive Gloss Overlap graph considering it as a Bayesian graphical model.

154. (FEATURE - DONE) Belief Propagation and RGO - Commits as on 20 June 2015
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SentimentAnalyzer is updated with a belief propagation algorithm (Pearl) based Sentiment scoring by
considering Recursive Gloss Overlap Definition Graph as graphical model and sentiwordnet score for
edge vertices as the belief potential propagated in the bayesian network (RGO graph). Since the
sentiment is a collective belief extracted from a text rather than on isolated words and the
sentiwordnet scores are probabilities if normalized, Sentiment Analysis is reduced to Belief Propagation problem.
The previous Belief Propagation function is invoked from SocialNetworkAnalysis_<> code to Sentiment Analyze tweet stream.

157. (THEORY) Recursive Gloss Overlap graphical model as a Deep Learning algorithm that is an alternative to Perceptrons - for text data
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Point 155 mentions the diverse applications of Recursive Gloss Overlap algorithm each of which touch upon multiple facets of Machine Learning (or) Deep Learning. Instead of a multi-layered perceptron and a backpropagation on it which have the standard notation (W . X + bias) and have to be built, the wordnet RGO subgraph presents itself readily as a deep learning model without any additional need for perceptrons with additional advantage that complete graph theory results apply to it(core numbers, pageranks, connectivity etc.,), making it a Graph-theoretical learning instead of statistical (for text data).

(kind of a PetriNet yet different). A special case of interest is when only few subgraphs of a giant EventNet is available and it is
often necessary to discover or guess the complete graph of causality with partakers. A familiar example is a crime scene investigation
where:
 - it is necessary to recreate the complete set of events and their causalities with partakers of a crime (reverse-engineering)
 - but only few clues or none are available - which are akin to very sparse subgraphs of the crime scene EventNet
 - Guessing (100-x)% of the graph from x% clue subgraphs can be conjectured to be an NP problem - because non-deterministic polynomially an
EventNet path can be guessed. As a counting problem this is #P-complete (set of all paths among known subgraphs of an unknown supergraph). But there is only one accepting path (could be in Unambigous Logspace if the number of states is in logspace) 

Another example: set of blind men try to make out an object by touch.

159. (THEORY) Pattern Grammar and Topological Homeomorphism of Writing Deformations
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Grammar for patterns like texts, pictures similar to RE,CFG etc., for pattern recognition:
   - example text grammar:  <a> := <o> <operator> <)>
   - example text grammar:  <d> := <o> <operator> <l>
   - example text grammar:  <v> := <\> <operator> </>
Previous grammar is extensible to any topological shapes. For example, handwriting of 2 individuals are
homeomorphic deformations.

160. (THEORY) Cognitive Element
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An element of a list or group is cognitive with respect to an operator if it "knows" about all or subset of other elements of list or group where "knowing" is subject to definition of operation as below:
   - In list 2,3,5,7,17 - 17 knows about 2,3,5,7 in the sense that 17 = 2+3+5+7 with + operator
   - In list "addon","add","on" - "addon" knows about "add" and "on" with concatenation operator 
   - In list "2,3,6,8,9,10,..." - 6 knows about 2 and 3, 10 knows about 2 and 5 with factorization as operator.
This might have an equivalent notion in algebra. Motivation for this is to abstract cognition as group operator. Essentially, this reduces
to an equivalence relation graph where elements are related by a cognitive operator edge.

161. (THEORY) Philosophical intuition for P(Good) summation - Continuation of (129) and other previous related points.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The apparent paradox in Perfect Voting can be reconciled as below to some extent:
- Voting is done in parallel in real-world elections and not serially
- Votes are counted in parallel - iterated integer addition in NC1 (http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/viola/classes/gems-08/lectures/le8.pdf)
- Thus if RHS is just Circuit-Value Problem and not a Circuit-SAT then LHS getting equated to RHS is not unusual - both can be NC or P-Complete
- Separation of RHS from LHS happens only when the Circuit-SAT is required in RHS.
- P(Good) convergence in perfect voting implies that Voter SAT is not necessary if there is perfection (proving the obvious). This is
true even though the PRG is imperfect that operates to choose on a perfect set.
- Parallelism implies NC circuits
- Above applies to infinite majority also (Mark Fey)
- RHS in worst-case can be EXP-Complete if the Majority+Voter SAT oracle circuit is of unrestricted depth and lot of variables are common across all voters. Proving EXP-completeness is ignored as it is evident from definition of DC circuits. Thus LHS has a P or NC algorithm to RHS EXP-Complete problem (something seemingly preposterous unless perfection is prohibited and voters do not have common variables in their boolean functions)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
162. (THEORY) Majority Voting Circuit with Boolean Function Oracles
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If each voter has a boolean function to decide which has fanout > 1 gates instead of a formula, RHS Majority Voting becomes generic.
Decision tree, Certificate,  and other complexity measures automatically come into reckoning. Thus RHS circuit is an infinite (non-uniform) majority circuit with boolean function circuit DAGs or oracles.

163. (THEORY) Parity and Constant Depth - intuition (not a formal proof, might have errors)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Inductive Hypothesis:
---------------------
For depth d and n variables parity has n^k sized circuit.

For n+1 variables:
-----------------
       XOR gate
       /      \
n-variable   (n+1)th variable
circuit     

Each XOR gate is of atleast depth 2 or 3 with formula - (x /\ not y) V (not x /\ y). Thus for each additional variable added depth gets added by atleast 2 contradicting the constant depth d in hypothesis above though size is polynomial.

cpp-src/cloud_move - Implementation of Move Semantics for Cloud objects:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This expands on the usual move semantics in C++ and implements a Perfect Forwarding of objects over cloud. A move client invokes the T&& rvalue reference move constructor to move(instead of copying) a local memory content to a remote machine in userspace. Functionality similar to this in kernelspace is required for transactional currency move in KingCobra - http://sourceforge.net/p/kcobra/code-svn/HEAD/tree/KingCobraDesignNotes.txt and https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/kingcobra-github-code/blob/master/KingCobraDesignNotes.txt. Though kernel with C++ code is not advised ,kingcobra driver can make an upcall to userspace move client and server executables and perfom currency move with .proto currency messages.

VIRGO kernel sockets code has been carried over and changed for userspace that uses traditional sockaddr_in and htons.

C++ sockets reference code adapted for std::move - for use_addrinfo clause:
- getaddrinfo linux man pages
- http://codebase.eu/tutorial/linux-socket-programming-c/ (addrinfo instead of usual sockaddr_in and htons)

Move semantics schematic:
-------------------------
                                    &
 member fn temp arg lvalue <-------source data rvalue
                  |                  /
              &   |                 / && (removes a temp copy)
                  |                /
                  V               /
client proxy destination lvalue<-/
                  |
                  |-------------------------> cloud server destination

lvalue reference& does additional copy which is removed by rvalue reference&& to get the rvalue directly. Move client proxies the remote object and connects to Move server and the object is written over socket.

Cloud Perfect Forwarding - Google Protocol Buffer Currency :
------------------------------------------------------------
Currency object has been implemented with Google Protocol Buffers - in cloud_move/protocol_buffers/ src_dir and out_dir directories. Currency has been defined in src_dir/currency.proto file. Choice of Protocol Buffer over other formats is due to:
- lack of JSON format language specific compilers
- XML is too complicated
- Protocol Buffers also have object serialization-to-text member functions in generated C++ classes.

Protocol Buffer compilation after change to currency object:

166. (THEORY) Debug Analytics,Software Analytics,Automated Debugging - 24 November 2019 - related to 65, 581
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Debugging software is painful process with repetitive labour - For example kernel and device driver development has the following lifecycle:
1. Writing the kernel patch code for some deep kernel panics.
2. Kernel incremental or full build.
3. Test the patch.
(1),(2) and (3) are sometimes frustratingly repetitive. If the debugging is represented as a state machine automaton, the cycles in automaton are the time consuming phases. Thus Debug Analytics can be defined as the problem to find the most efficient debug state machine automaton without cycles or with least number of cycles and cycles of least length. 
Delta debugging algorithm bisects the code changes between two successive commits recursively and isolates the code snippet causing the regression in unit testing. Example: If revision r+1 has the patch set [p1,p2,p3,p4,p5] over revision r, delta debugging creates delta subsets [p1,p2],[p3],[p4,p5] and applies the deltas incrementally over r as paths in a binary search tree by union() and minus() primitives based on unit test pass or fail - for instance the path:
	 r+[p1,p2] - pass, r+[p1,p2] union [p3] - pass , r + [p1,p2,p3] union [p4,p5] - fail
isolates [p4,p5] delta as point of failure. minus() primitive is applied to [p1,p2,p3,p4,p5] and [p4,p5] are segregated to fail state in bisection. Program state reachability graphs are obtained by a fixed point of variables as vertices and edges amongst them are deduced from pointer analysis. These program states between two consecutive revision states create a stream of Program state graphs which is a Streaming Common Subgraph Mining problem. Correlating the common subgraphs in the program state graph stream and corresponding unit test pass-fail binary stream for sequence of patch revisions yields insights into the regression causing state subgraph:
	... Graph(r)-Graph(r+delta) ...
	... Pass-Fail ...
Debug Analytics goes further beyond isolating the buggy code and asks for minimum state debug automaton if any which resolves the bug.

167. (THEORY) Prestige based ranking and Condorcet Elections
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Web Search Engine Rankings by prestige measures are n-tuples of rankings (for n candidate web pages where n could be few billions) which are not condorcet rankings. Arrow's Theorem for 3-candidate condorcet election allows a winner if and only if there is dictatorship. If there are m search engines each creating n-tuples of condorcet rankings (NAE tuples), then conjecturally there shouldn't be a voting rule or a meta search engine that circumvents circular rankings and produces a reconciled ranking of all NAE tuples from m search engines.

Above are excerpts from the logs added to testlogs/ for Sequence mined from HURDAT2 dataset for hurricanes from 1851 to 2012. Similar to the sequence mining done for Earthquake datasets, some of the mined sequences above are strikingly similar to astronomical conjunctions already mentioned in few astrological classics (E.g Sun-Mercury-Venus - the legendary Sun flanked by Mercury and Venus, Mercury-Venus) and many others look quite new (e.g prominence of Venus-Saturn). Though these correlations can be dismissed as coincidental, these patterns are output automatically through a standard machine learning algorithm like Sequence Mining on astronomical datasets without any non-scientific assumptions whatsoever. Scientific corroboration of the above might require knowhow beyond purview of computer science - e.g Oceanography, Gravitational Effects on Tectonic Geology etc.,

    - Corrections to Convolution Map Neuron computation with per-coordinate weight added
    - Removed hardcoded convolution stride and pooling width in the class
    - testlogs following input bitmap features have been added with the output of 5 neurons in final layer:
        - Without Zero inscribed
        - With Zero inscribed in bitmap as 1s
        - With Bigger Zero inscribed in bitmap as 1s
        - With Biggest Zero inscribed in bitmap as 1s
      The variation of final neural outputs can be gleaned as the size of the pattern increases from none to biggest. 
      The threshold has to be set to neural output without patterns. Anything above it shows a pattern.
    - Added a config variable for invoking cloud perfect forwarding binaries in KingCobra in asfer.conf
    - config_map updated in asfer.cpp for enableCloudPerfectForwarding config variable

178. (THEORY) Approximate Machine Translation with Recursive Gloss Overlap Definition Graph
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For natural language X (=English) an RGO graph can be constructed (based on algorithms in http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.4458 and http://www.nist.gov/tac/publications/2010/participant.papers/CMI_IIT.proceedings.pdf). This definition graph is a subgraph of WordNet-English. Each vertex is a word from English dictionary. New RGO graph for language Y is constructed from RGO(X) by mapping each vertex in RGO(X) to corresponding word in language Y. RGO(X) and RGO(Y) are isomorphic graphs. Sentences in language Y can be constructed with lamda composition closure on the RGO(Y) graph implemented already. This is an approximation for machine translation between two natural languages. I
n the converse direction, text graphs of 2 texts in 2 different natural languages can be verified for Graph Isomo
rphism. Isomorphic text graphs in two natural languages prima facie indicate the texts are similarly organized an
d have same meaning.

179. (FEATURE - DONE) Web Spider Implementation with Scrapy Framework - Commits as on 16 November 2015
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Initial commits for a Web Spider - Crawl and Scrape - done with Scrapy framework. Presently it crawls Google News for a query and scrapes the search results to output a list of lines or a digest of the news link texts. This output file can be used for Sentiment Analysis with Recursive Gloss Overlap already implemented.  Complete Scrapy project hierarchy is being added to the repository with spider in WebSpider.py and
crawled items in items.py

Sentiment Analyzer implementation for Crawled-Scraped Google News Search result texts with testlogs and screenshots of the RGO graph has
been added. This has been made a specialized analyzer for spidered texts different from twitter analyzer.

Requirements.txt for package dependencies have been added to asfer-docs/.
WebSpider Crawl-Scraped URLs descriptions are inserted into MySQL table (asfer_webspider) by importing backend/Abstract_DBBackend.py MySQL
implementation. Logs for this Scrapy crawl has been added to webspider/testlogs. WebSpider.py parse() has been updated with MySQL_DBBackend execute_query()s.  __init__.py have been added for directory-as-package imports.

182. Commits as on 19 November 2015
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Added more stop words in spidered text and commented text generation in SocialNetworkAnalysis_WebSpider.py
- logs and screenshots for this has been added to testlogs/
- crawl urls in WebSpider.py has been updated
- Added more edges in definition graph by enumerating all the lemma names of a keyword in previous iteration. This makes the graph dense
and probability of a node having more k-core number increases and classification is more accurate.
- logs and screenshots for updated web spidered news texts of two topics "Theoretical Computer Science" and "Chennai" have been added

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
183. Commits as on 20 November 2015
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Updated Spidered text for Sentiment Analysis
- Changed the Sentiment Analysis scoring belief potential propagation algorithm:
  - Two ways of scoring have been added - one is based on DFS tree of k-core subgraph of the larger wordnet subgraph and the other is based on top core numbered vertices of the wordnet subgraph
  - Sentiment thus is computed only for the core of the graph which is more relevant to the crux or class of the document and less pertinent
vertices are ignored.
  - the fraction score is multiplied by a heuristic factor to circumvent floating points

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
184. Commits as on 23 November 2015
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Updated SentimentAnalyzer.py and SocialNetworkAnalysis_Twitter.py scripts with core number and k-core DFS belief potential propagation
similar to SocialNetworkAnalysis_WebSpider.py.
- logs and screenshots for twitter followers graph and tweet RGO graph Sentiment Analysis have been added.
- Example tweet is correctly automatically classified into "Education" class based on top core number of the vertices and top PageRank. Again this is an intriguing instance where Top core numbered vertices coincide with Top PageRank vertices which is probably self-evident from the fact that PageRank is a Markov Model Converging Random Walk and PageRank matrix multiplication is influenced by high weightage vertices (with lot of incoming links)
Sentiment Analysis of the tweet:
- K-Core DFS belief_propagated_posscore: 244.140625
  K-Core DFS belief_propagated_negscore: 1.0
- Core Number belief_propagated_posscore: 419095.158577
  Core Number belief_propagated_negscore: 22888.1835938
- Above Sentiment Analysis rates the tweet with positive tonality.

185. Commits as on 25 November 2015
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New WordNetPath.py file has been added to compute the path in a WordNet graph between two words
- WordNetSearchAndVisualizer.py text generation code has been updated for importing and invoking path_between() function in WordNetPath.py
by which set of sentences are created from the RGO WordNet subgraph. This path is obtained from common hypernyms for two word vertices for each of the edges in RGO WordNet subgraph. RGO graph is a WordNet+ graph as it adds a new relation "is in definition of" to the existing WordNet
that enhances WordNet relations. Each edge in RGO graph is made a hyperedge due to this hypernym path finding.
- logs and screenshots have been added for above

The text generated for the hypernym paths in WordNet subgraph in testlogs/ is quite primitive and sentences are connected with " is related to " phrase. More natural-looking sentences can be created with randomly chosen phrase connectives and random sentence lengths.

190. (FEATURE - DONE) Commits as on 11 December 2015
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dependency Injection code commits for MongoDB backend - With this MongoDB is also a storage backend for AsFer algorithms similar to MySQL:
- Abstract_DBBackend.py has been updated for both MySQL and MongoDB injections
- MongoDB configuration and backend connect/query code has been added. Backend is either populated by Robomongo or pymongo reading from the
Streaming Abstract Generator iterable framework.
- With this AsFer supports both SQL(MySQL) and NoSQL(file,hive,hbase,cassandra backends in Streaming Abstract Generator).
- log with a simple NoSQL table with StreamingData.txt and USBWWAN data has been added to testlogs/.
- MongoDB configuration has a database(asfer-database) and a collection(asfer-collection).
- MongoDB_DBBackend @provides pymongo.collection.Collection which is @inject-ed to Abstract_DBBackend
- Abstract_DBBackend changes have been reflected in Scrapy Web Spider - backend added as argument in execute_query()
- Abstract_DBBackend.py has a subtle problem:
        - Multiple @inject(s) are not supported in Python Injector
        - only the innermost @inject works and outer @inject throws a __init__ argument errors in webspider/
        - Conditional @inject depending on backend is required but at present switching the order of @inject(s) circumvents this
- most recent scrapy crawl logs for this have been added to webspider/testlogs

191. (THEORY) An update and additions to runtime analysis of Recursive Gloss Overlap Algorithm in TAC 2010
(http://www.nist.gov/tac/publications/2010/participant.papers/CMI_IIT.proceedings.pdf)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Analysis of runtime in the link above is too cryptic. An updated analysis of steps are given here:
- Nodes at topmost level are keywords in document. For each subsequent recursion step following analysis is per keyword.
- Nodes at level i-1 are computed (base case) : x^(i-1) where x is average size of gloss definition
- Naive pairwise comparison of overlap is done at level i-1 which makes it x^2(i-1)
- Tree isomorphism algorithms can be optionally applied to reduce number of nodes getting recomputed. There are
polytime algorithms for subtree isomorphisms (www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~dekelts/publications/subtree.pdf)
- Nodes at level i-1 are reduced by Overlap(i-1) : x^(i-1) - Overlap(i-1)
- Maximum number Nodes at level i - are from gloss expansion of those at i-1 : (x^(i-1) - Overlap(i-1))*x
- Thus total time at level i is: Time_for_pairwise_comparison_to_find_gloss_verlap + Time_for_removing_isomorphic_nodes
T(i) = sigma([x^(i-1) - Overlap(i-1)]^2 + subtree_isomorphism(i)))
- Above is naively upperbounded to O(x^(2d)) [as subtree isomorphism is polynomial in supertree and subtree vertices and is only an optimization step that can be ignored]. For W keywords in the document time bound is O(W*x^(2d)).
- If number of vertices in RGO multipartite graph (ignoring isomorphism) constructed above is V=O(x^(d)), runtime is O(W*V^2)  which is
far less than O(E*V^2) mentioned in TAC 2010 link because number of keywords in toplevel are less than number of edges created during recursion which depend on x and exponentially on d. For example after first recursion completion, number of edges are W*x.
- On a related note runtime for intrinsic merit ranking of the RGO wordnet subgraph can not be equated per-se to ranking from prestige-based search engines as RGO is objective graph-theoretic ranking (does not require massive bot-crawling, indexing and link graph construction) and PageRank is subjective prestige based ranking(depends on crawling, indexing and time needed for link graph construction). Standard publicly available PageRank iteratively computes random walk matrix multiplication for link graphs for billions of nodes on WWW and this runtime has to be apportioned per-node. Time and Space for crawling and indexing have also to be accounted for per-node. Naive bound for PageRank per node is O(time_for_iterative_matrix_multiplication_till_convergence/number_of_nodes). Matrix multiplication is O(n^omega) where omega~2.3. Thus pagerank bound per node is O(((n^omega)*iterations)/n) assuming serial PageRank computation. Parallel Distributed Versions of PageRank depend on network size and scalable.
- Parallel Recursive Gloss Overlap graph construction on a cloud could reduce the runtime to O(W*V^2/c) where c is size of the cloud.

192. (FEATURE - DONE) Commits as on 14 December 2015
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New Interview Algorithm script with NetworkX+Matplotlib rendering and takes as input a randomly crawled HTML webpage(uses beautiful soup to
rip off script and style tags and write only text in the HTML page) has been added
- Above script also computes the graph theoretic connectivity of the RGO wordnet subgraph based on Menger's theorem - prints number of nodes
required to disconnect the graph or equivalently number of node indpendent paths
- logs and screenshots for the above have been added
- WebSpider.py has been updated to crawl based on a crawling target parameter - Either a streaming website(twitter, streamed news etc.,) or a
HTML webpage

193. (FEATURE - DONE) RGO graph complexity measures for intrinsic merit of a text document - Commits as on 15 December 2015
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Interview Algorithm Crawl-Visual script has been updated with a DOT graph file writing which creates a .dot file for the RGO graph constructed
- Also variety of connectivity and graph complexity measures have been added
- Importantly a new Tree Width computing script has been added. NetworkX does not have API for tree width, hence a naive script that iterates
through all subgraphs and finds intersecting subgraphs to connect them and form a junction tree, has been written. This is a costly measure compared to intrinsic merit which depends only on graph edges,vertices and depth of recursive gloss overlap. Tree decomposition of graph is NP-hard.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
194. Commits as on 16 December 2015
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- TreeWidth implementation has been corrected to take as input set of edges of the RGO graph
- TreeWidth for set of subgraphs less than an input parameter size is computed as TreeWidth computation is exponential in graph size
and there are MemoryErrors in python for huge set of all subgraphs. For example even a small graph with 10 nodes gives rise to 1024
possible subgraphs
- Spidered text has been updated to create a small RGO graph
- Logs and screenshots have been added
- Each subgraph is hashed to create a unique string for each subgraph
- TreeWidth is printed by finding maximum set in junction tree

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
195. (THEORY) WordNet, Evocation, Neural networks, Recursive Gloss Overlap and Circuit Complexity
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WordNet and Evocation WordNet are machine learning models based on findings from psychological experiments. Are WordNet and Neural networks
related? Evocation WordNet which is network of words based on how evocative a word is of another word readily translates to a neural network.
This is because a machine learning abstraction of neuron - perceptron - takes weights, inputs and biases and if the linear program of these breach a threshold, output is activated. Evocative WordNet can be formulated as a neuron with input word as one end of an edge and the output word as the other end - a word evokes another word. Each edge of an Evocation WordNet or even a WordNet is a single input neuron and WordNet is one giant multilayered perceptron neural network. Since Threshold circuits or TC circuit complexity class are theoretical equivalents of a machine learning neuron model (threshold gate outputs 1 if more than k of inputs are 1 and thus an activation function of a neuron), WordNet is hence a gigantic non-uniform TC circuit of Threshold gates. Further TCk is in NC(k+1). This implies that all problems depending on WordNet are inherently parallelizable in theory and Recursive Gloss Overlap algorithm that depends on WordNet subgraph construction in http://www.nist.gov/tac/publications/2010/participant.papers/CMI_IIT.proceedings.pdf and updates to it in (191) above are non-uniformly parallelizable.

196. (FEATURE - DONE) Mined Rule Search in Astronomical Data - Commits as on 17 December 2015
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New Mined Class Association Rule Search script has been added. This script searches the astronomical data with parsed Maitreya Text client
data with date, time and longitude-latitude queries.
- Where this is useful is after mining the astronomical data with SequenceMining, there is a necessity to search when a particular mined rule occurs. This is an experimental, non-conventional automated weather prediction (but not necessarily unscientific as it requires expertise beyond computer science to establish veracity).
- Logs for this has been added in testlogs/ and chartsummary.rulesearch

198. (THEORY) Star Complexity of Graphs - Complement Function circuit and Unsupervised Classification with RGO graph
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Star complexity of a graph defined in [Stasys Jukna] - http://www.thi.informatik.uni-frankfurt.de/~jukna/ftp/graph-compl.pdf
 is the minimum number of union and intersection operations of star subgraphs required to create the larger graph which is strikingly relevant to the necessity of quantitative intrinsic merit computation in Recursive Gloss Overlap algorithm [http://www.nist.gov/tac/publications/2010/participant.papers/CMI_IIT.proceedings.pdf]. Each star subgraph of the definition graph is an unsupervised automatically found class a text belongs to. Apart from this star complexity of a boolean circuit graph for Complement Function http://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.4102v1.pdf and in particular for Prime complement special case should have direct relationship conjecturally to pattern in primes because boolean formula for the graph depends on prime bits.

199. (FEATURE - DONE) Tornado Webserver, REST API and GUI for NeuronRain - Commits as on 22 December 2015
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Commits for NeuronRain WebServer-RESTfulAPI-GUI based on tornado in python-src/webserver_rest_ui/:
- NeuronRain entrypoint based on tornado that reads a template and implements GET and POST methods
- templates/ contains renderable html templates
- testlogs/ has neuronrain GUI logs
- RESTful API entrypoint <host:33333>/neuronrain

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
200. (FEATURE - DONE) NeuronRain as SaaS and PaaS - for commits above in (199)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RESTful and python tornado based Graphical User Interface entrypoint that reads from various html templates and passes on
incoming concurrent requests to NeuronRain subsystems - AsFer, VIRGO, KingCobra, USBmd and Acadpdrafts - has bee added. Presently implements
simplest possible POST form without too much rendering (might require flask, twisted, jinja2 etc.,) for AsFer algorithms execution.
This exposes a RESTful API for commandline clients like cURL. For example a cURL POST is done to NeuronRain as:
cURL POST: curl -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -X POST -d '{"component":"AsFer","script":"<script_name>","arguments":"<args>"}' http://localhost:33333/neuronrain where REST url is <host:port>/neuronrain.  Otherwise REST clients such as Advanced RESTful Client browser app can be used.
With this NeuronRain is Software-As-A-Service (SaaS) Platform deployable on VIRGO linux kernel cloud, cloud OSes and containers like Docker.
More so, it is Platform-As-A-Service (PaaS) when run on a VIRGO cloud.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
201. (FEATURE - DONE) Apache Spark MapReduce Parallel Computation of Interview Algorithm Recursive Gloss Overlap Graph Construction
 - Commits as on 24 December 2015
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- 2 python files for Spark MapReduce of Recursive Gloss Overlap graph construction has been added to repository
- These two implement Interview Algorithm Recursive Gloss Overlap graph construction and Map-Reduce functions that parallellize
each recursion step computing the gloss tokens from previous recursion level. This is the most important part of the algorithm which
consumes lot of time in serial version along with overlap computation. Apache Spark has been recently gaining importance over its plain Hadoop counterpart and is many times faster than Hadoop in benchmarks.
- In this implementation, Resilient Distributed Dataset is the set of tokens in each recursion level and is parallelly computable in a
huge Spark cluster.
- For example if Spark cluster has 10000 nodes, and each level of recursion produces X number of gloss tokens for graph vertices, time
complexity in Spark is O(X/10000) where as serial version is O(X) with negligible network overhead. Spark has in-memory datasets which
minimizes network latency because of disk access.
- There were lot of implementation issues to make the parallellism. Map and Reduce functions use namedtuples to return data. With more than one
field in namedtuple, there are internal pickling issues in Py4J - Python4Java which PySpark internally invokes to get streamed socket bytes from
Java side of the object wrapped as an iterable. This prevents returning multiple values - for example Synsets - in Map-Reduce functions.
- So only tokens at a level are map-reduced and returned while the prevlevelsynsets (required for adding edges across vertices) are "pickled"
with a properietary asfer_pickle_load() and asfer_pickle_dump() functions that circumvents the python and java vagaries in pickling.
- With proprietary pickling and Map-Reduce functions, Recursive Gloss Overlap graph has been constructed in parallel. Screenshots for this has been added in testlogs.
- Proprietary pickling is done to a text file which is also added to repository. This file is truncated at the end of each recursion.
- Subtlety here is that maximum number of tokens at a recursion level t = number_of_tokens_at_level_(t-1) * maximum_size_of_gloss_per_word(s)
which grows as series = number_of_words*(1 + s + s^2 + s^3 + ... + s^t_max). Size of a document - number of words - can be upperbounded by a constant (d) due to finiteness of average text documents in realworld ignoring special cases of huge webpages with PDF/other.
- If size of the Spark cluster is O(f(d)*s^t_max), each recursion step is of time O(d*s^t_max/f(d)*s^t_max)=O(d/f(d)) and total time for all levels is O(d*t_max/f(d)) which is ranking time per text document. This bound neglects optimization from overlaps and isomorphic nodes removal and is worst case upperbound. For ranking n documents this time bound becomes O(n*d*t_max/f(d)). For constant t_max this bound is O(n*d/f(d)) - and thus linearly scalable.
- Maximum size of gloss per word (s) is also an upper-boundable constant. With constant d and t_max , size of cluster O(f(d)*s^t_max) is constant too independent of number of documents.
- Example: For set of 1000 word documents with f(d)=log(d), max gloss size 5 and recursion depth 2, size of cluster is O(log(1000)*25)~250 nodes with runtime for ranking n documents = O(n*1000*t_max/log(1000)=O(n*100*t_max) which is O(n) for constant t_max.
- Above is just an estimate of approximate speedup achievable in Spark cluster. Ideally runtime in Spark cloud should be on the lines of analysis in (191) - O(n*d*s^2(t_max)/f(d)*s^t_max) = O(n*d*s^t_max/f(d)).
- Thus runtime upperbound in worst case is O(n*d*s^t_max/f(d)) for cluster size O(f(d)*s^t_max).
- If cluster autoscales based on number of documents also, size is a function of n and hence previous size bound is changed to O(g(n)*f(d)*s^t_max) and corresponding time bound = O(n*d*s^2(t_max)/(f(d)*s^t_max*g(n))) = O(n*d*s^t_max/(f(d)*g(n)))

202. (THEORY) Recursive Gloss Overlap, Cognitive and PsychoLinguistics and Language Comprehension
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recursive Gloss Overlap algorithm constructs a graph from text documents. Presently WordNet is probably the only solution available to
get relations across words in a document. But the algorithm does not assume WordNet alone. Any future available algorithms to create relational graphs from texts should be able to take the place of WordNet. Evocation WordNet (http://wordnet.cs.princeton.edu/downloads/evocation.zip) is better than WordNet as it closely resembles a neural network model of a word evocative of the other word and has stronger psychological motivation. There have been efforts to combine FrameNet, VerbNet and WordNet into one graph. Merit of a document is independent of grammar and language in which it is written. For example a text in English and French with grammatical errors delving on the same subject are equivalently treated by this algorithm as language is just a pointer to latent information buried in a document. Process of Language Comprehension is a field of study in Cognitive and Psychological Linguistics. Problem with prestige based subjective rankings is that same document might get varied reviews from multiple sources and consensus with majority voting is required. This is somewhat contrary to commonsense because it assumes majority decision is correct 100% (this is exactly the problem analyzed by P(Good) binomial summation and majority voting circuits elsewhere in this document). In complexity parlance prestige rankings are in BP* classes. Objective rankings are also in BP* classes because of dependency on the framework like WordNet to extract relationships without errors, but less costlier than prestige rankings - major cost saving being lack of dependence on WWW link graph crawling to rank a document.

Intuition for Recursive Gloss Overlap for weighing natural language texts is from computational linguistics, Eye-Movement tracking and Circuit of the Mind [Leslie Valiant]. Human process of comprehending language, recursion as an inherent trait of human faculty and evolution of language from primates to human is described in http://www.sciencemag.org/content/298/5598/1569, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12446899 and http://ling.umd.edu/~colin/courses/honr218l_2007/honr218l_presentation7.ppt by [Hauser, NoamChomsky and Fitch] with an example part-of-speech recursive tree of a sentence. For example, a human reader's eye usually scans each sentence in a text document word by word left-to-right, concatenating the meanings of the words read so far. Usually such a reader assumes grammatical correctness (any grammatical anamoly raises his eyebrows) and only accrues the keyword meanings and tries to connect them through a meaningful path between words by thinking deep into meaning of each word. This is exactly simulated in Recursive Gloss Overlap graph where gloss overlaps connect the words recursively. Fast readers have reasonably high eye-movement, sometimes randomly. The varied degree of this ability to form an accurate connected visualization of a text probably differentiates people's intellectual wherewithal to draw inferences. From theory of computation perspective, recursive gloss overlap constructs a disambiguated Context Sensitive graph from Natural language text a superset of context free grammars. But natural languages are suspected to be subset of larger classes of context sensitive languages accepted by Linear Bounded Automata. Thus reverse engineering a text from the recursive gloss overlap graph may yield a language larger than natural languages. Information loss due to text-to-graph translation should only be grammatical ideally (e.g Parts of Speech, connectives etc.,) because for comparing two documents for information quality, grammar shouldn't be a factor unless there are fringe cases where missing grammar might change the meaning of a document. Corrections for pre-existing grammatical errors are not responsibilities of this algorithm. This fringe case should be already taken care of by preprocessing ingestion phase that proof-reads the document for primitive grammatical correctness though not extensive and part-of-speech. Recursive Gloss Overlap graph constructed with Semantic Net frameworks like WordNet, Evocation WordNet, VerbNet, FrameNet, ConceptNet, SentiWordNet etc., can be fortified by mingling Part-of-Speech trees for sentences in a document with already constructed graph. This adds grammar information to the text graph.

Psycholinguistics have the notion of event related potentials - when brain reacts excessively to anamolous words in neural impulses. Ideal intrinsic merit rankings should also account for such ERP data to distinguish unusual sentences, but datasets for ERPs are not widely accessible except SentiWordNet. Hence Recursive Gloss Overlap is the closest possible for comparative study of multiple documents that ignores parts-of-speech, subjective assessments and focuses only on intrinsic information content and relatedness.

A thought experiment of intrinsic merit versus prestige ranking:
Performance of an academic personality is measured first by accolades,awards,grades etc., which form the societal opinion - prestige (citations). That is prestige is created from intrinsic merit. But measuring merit from prestige is anachronistic because merit precedes prestige. Ideally prestige and intrinsic merit should coincide when the algorithms are equally error-free. In case of error, prestige and merit are two intersecting worlds where documents without merit might have prestige and vice-versa. Size of the set-difference is measure of error.

The delivery time (or) path between 2 nodes is optimum when r=2 and has an inverted bell-curve approximately. When r is less than 2 and greater than 2 delivery time is high i.e finding the path between two nodes is difficult. In the context of judging merit by definition graph of a document, document is "meaningful" if it is "relatively easier" to find a path between two nodes(Resnik,Jiang-Conrath concept similarity and distance measures). This assumes the definition graph is modelled as a random graph. Present RGO definition graph algorithm does not create a random, weighted graph - this requires probabilistic weighted ontology. Statically, Kleinberg's result implies that document definition graphs with r=2 are more "meaningful, readable and visualizable" and can be easily understood where r is proportional to word-word edge distance measures (Resnik,Jiang-Conrath).

203. Apache Spark MapReduce Parallel Computation of Interview Algorithm Recursive Gloss Overlap Graph Construction
- Commits as on 25 December 2015
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Added more parallelism to python-src/InterviewAlgorithm/InterviewAlgorithmWithIntrinisicMerit_Crawl_Visual_Spark.py. New map-reduce functions
for computing parents (backedges in the recursion) have been added - mapFunction_Parents(), reduceFunction_Parents(), SparkMapReduce_Parents()
in python-src/InterviewAlgorithm/InterviewAlgorithmWithIntrinisicMerit_SparkMapReducer.py
- These functions take the previous level tokens as inputs instead if synsets

205. Commits as on 29 December 2015
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Updated python-src/InterviewAlgorithm/InterviewAlgorithmWithIntrinisicMerit_Crawl_Visual_Spark.py for choosing parallel spark mapreduce or
serial parents backedges computation based on a boolean function.
- This is because Recursive tokens mapreduce computation (Spark_MapReduce) is faster than serial version.
But serial parents computation is faster than parallel parents computation ironically(Spark_MapReduce_Parents).
This happens on single node Spark cluster.  So, parents computation has been made configurable(serial or parallel)
- Logs and Screenshots for various texts experimented have been added to testlogs/
- python-src/InterviewAlgorithm/InterviewAlgorithmWithIntrinisicMerit_SparkMapReducer.py mapreduce uses best_matching_synset() for
disambiguation now which was commented earlier.
- MapFunction_Parents() has a pickling problem in taking a tuple of synset objects as input arg due to which synsets have to be recomputed that
 causes the slowdown mentioned above compared to serial parents() version. MapFunction_Parents() has been rewritten to take previous level gloss tokens in lieu of synsets to circumvent pickling issues.
- Slowdown could be resolved on a huge cluster.
- Thus this is a mix of serial+parallel implementation.
- Logs,DOT file and Screenshots for mapreduced parents() computation

207. Commits as on 31 December 2015
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Spark Recursive Gloss Overlap Intrinsic Merit code has been optimized and some minutiae bugs have been resolved.
- Map function for parents computation in Spark cluster has been updated to act upon only the previous recursion level glosses
by proprietary pickling of the keyword into a file storage and loading it, and not as a function argument
- Problems with previous level gloss tokens were almost similar to MapReduce functions of the recursion
- New pickling file for parents computation in Spark has been added
- logs and screenshots have been added to testlogs
- With this, Spark Intrinsic Merit computation is highly parallellized apt for large clouds
- Also a parents_tokens() function that uses gloss tokens instead of synsets has been added
- New pickling dump() and load() functions have been added for keyword storage
- pickling is synchronized with python threading lock acquire() and release(). Shouldn't be necessary because of
Concurrent Read Exclusive Write (CREW) of keyword, but for safer side to prevent Spark-internal races.

216. (THEORY) Recursive Lambda Function Growth Algorithm - Psycholinguistic Functional Programming simulation of Human Reader Eye Movement Tracking and its special setting application in Recursive Gloss Overlap
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example sentence:
California Gas Leak Exposes Growing Natural Gas Risks.

A left-right scan of the human reading groups the sentence into set of phrases and connectives and grows top-down gloss overlap graphs:
p1 - California Gas Leak
p2 - Exposes
p3 - Growing Natural Gas Risks

For each phrase left-right, meaning is created by recursive gloss overlap disambiguated graph construction top-down (graph is constructed left-right, top-down):
p1 - graph g1
p2 - graph g2
p3 - graph g3

Prefix graph construction and functional programming:
Above sentence has three prefix phrases and graphs- p1, p1-p2, p1-p2-p3 in order (and g1, g1-g2, g1-g2-g3). As reader scans the sentence, meaning is built over time period by lambda function composition.  Function f1 is applied to g1,g2 - f1(g1,g2) - f1(g1(California Gas Leak), g2(Exposes)) - which returns a new graph for prefix p1-p2.  Function f2 is applied to f1(g1,g2) and g3 - f2(f1(g1,g2),g3(Growing Natural Gas Risks)) - which returns a new graph for sentence p1-p2-p3. This is recursively continued and above example can be generalized to arbitrarily long sentences.

This formulation does not depend on just semantic graphs - graphs g1,g2 and g3 could be functional programming subroutines too, which makes f2(f1(g1,g2),g3) as one complete function composition tree. In previous example, for each phrase a function is defined and finally they are composed:
p1 - function g1  - california_gas_leak()
p2 - function g2  - exposes()
p3 - function g3  - growing_natural_gas_risks()
f3 = f2(f1(g1,g2),g3)

How functions f1,f2,g1,g2,g3 are internally implemented is subjective. These functions are dynamically created and evaluated on the fly. Grouping sentences into phrases and connectives has to be a preprocessing step that uses PoS NER tagger - even a naive parsing for language connectives should suffice. Return values of these functions are functions themselves - this is standard "First Class Object" concept in higher order lambda calculus - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_citizen . These functions themselves might invoke smaller subroutines internally which build meaning and return to previous level. Recursive Gloss Overlap implements a special case of this where f1,f2 are gloss overlap functions and g1,g2,g3 are wordnet subgraphs. Its Spark implementation does a "Parallel-Read, Top-Down Graph construction" as against left-right read. In a more generic alternative, these functions could be deep learning neural networks, LISP subroutines etc., that compute "meaning" of the corresponding phrase. If the reading is not restricted to left-right, the composition tree should ideally look like a balanced binary tree per sentence. This is a kind of "Mind-Grows-Functions" formalism similar to the Mind-Grows-Circuit paradigm in [Rina Panigrahy, Li Zhang] - http://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.0088v2.pdf. It is questionable as to what does "Meaning" mean - is it a graph, neural electric impulse in brain etc., and the question itself is self-referencing godel sentence: What is meant by meaning? - which may not have answers in an axiomatic system because word "meaning" has to be defined by something more atomic than "meaning" itself.

As an ideal human sense of "meaning" stored in brain is vague and requires a "Consciousness and Freewill" theory, only a computation theoretic definition of meaning (i.e a circuit graph) is axiomatically assumed. Thus above lambda function composition is theoretically equivalent to boolean function composition (hence circuit composition). With this the above recursive lambda function growth algorithm bridges two apparently disconnected worlds - complexity theory and machine learning practice - and hence a computational learning theory algorithm only difference being it learns a generic higher-order lambda function (special case is recursive gloss overlap) from text alphabet strings rather than a boolean function from binary strings over {0,1} alphabet. Essentially every lambda function should have a circuit by Church-Turing thesis and its variants - Church-Turing thesis which states that any human computable function is turing-computable is still an axiom without proof on which computer science has been founded. Because of this equivalence of lambda functions and Turing machines, the lambda function learning algorithm essentially covers all possible complexity classes which include Recursively Enumerable languages. Theoretically, concepts of noise sensitivity, influence which measure the probability of output change for flipped input should apply to this lambda function learning algorithm for text documents - For example typo or error in grammar that affects the meaning.

Learning theory perspective of the previous - From Linial-Mansour-Nisan theorem , class of boolean functions of n variables with depth-d can be learnt in O(n^O(logn^d)) with 1/poly(n) error. Consequentially, Above Lambda Function Growth for depth d can be encoded as a circuit (a TC circuit in wordnet special case) that has n inputs where n are number of keywords in text (each word is boolean encoded to a binary string of constant length) and learnt in O(n^O(logn^d)) with 1/poly(n) error. This learning theory bound has striking resemblance to parallel Recursive Gloss Overlap bound of O(n1*d1*s^t_max/(g(n1)*f(d1))) for n1 documents with d1 keywords each on a cluster. Equating to LMN bound gives rise to interesting implication that average number of gloss per keyword = log(number_of_keywords) which is too high gloss size per word(other variables equated as n=d1,t_max=d). Therefore recursive gloss overlap could be faster than LMN learning algorithm.

220. (FEATURE - DONE)  Python-C++-VIRGOKernel and Python-C-VIRGOKernel boost::python and cpython implementations:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- It is a known idiom that Linux Kernel and C++ are not compatible.
- In this commit an important feature to invoke VIRGO Linux Kernel from userspace python libraries via two alternatives have been added.
- In one alternative, C++ boost::python extensions have been added to encapsulate access to VIRGO memory system calls - virgo_malloc(), virgo_set(), virgo_get(), virgo_free(). Initial testing reveals that C++ and Kernel are not too incompatible and all the VIRGO memory system calls work well though initially there were some errors because of config issues.
- In the other alternative, C Python extensions have been added that replicate boost::python extensions above in C - C Python with Linux kernel
works exceedingly well compared to boost::python.
- This functionality is required when there is a need to set kernel analytics configuration variables learnt by AsFer Machine Learning Code
dynamically without re-reading /etc/virgo_kernel_analytics.conf.
- This completes a major integration step of NeuronRain suite - request travel roundtrip to-and-fro top level machine-learning C++/python
code and rock-bottom C linux kernel - bull tamed ;-).
- This kind of python access to device drivers is available for Graphics Drivers already on linux (GPIO - for accessing device states)
- logs for both C++ and C paths have been added in cpp_boost_python_extensions/ and cpython_extensions.
- top level python scripts to access VIRGO kernel system calls have been added in both directories:
        CPython - python cpython_extensions/asferpythonextensions.py
        C++ Boost::Python - python cpp_boost_python_extensions/asferpythonextensions.py
- .so, .o files with build commandlines(asferpythonextensions.build.out) for "python setup.py build" have been added
in build lib and temp directories.
- main implementations for C++ and C are in cpp_boost_python_extensions/asferpythonextensions.cpp and cpython_extensions/asferpythonextensions.c

222. (THEORY) Recursive Lambda Function Growth Algorithm - 216 elaborated with examples
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boolean function learning and PAC learning are special cases of this Lambda function learning algorithm because any
intermediate lambda function can be a boolean function too.

Algorithms steps for English Natural Language Procssing - Parallel read:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Approximate midpoint of the sentence is known apriori
- Language specific connectives are known apriori (e.g is, was, were, when, who etc.,)
- Sentence is recursively split into phrases and connectives and converted into lambda functions with balanced number of nodes in left and right subtrees
- Root of each subtree is unique name of the function

Example Sentence1:
-----------------
PH is infinite relative to random oracle.

Above sentence is translated into a lambda function composition tree as:
relative(is(PH, infinite), to(random,oracle))) which is a tree of depth 3

In this example every word and grammatical connective is a lambda function that takes some arguments and returns a partial "purport" or "meaning" of that segment of sentence. These partial computations are aggregated bottom-up and culminate in root.

Example Sentence2:
-----------------
Farming and Farmers are critical to success of a country like India.

Above sentence is translated into a lambda function composition tree as:
Critical(are(and(Farming,Farmers)), a(success(to,of), like(country, India)))

This composition is slightly different from Part-of-Speech trees and inorder traversal of the tree yields original sentence.
As functions are evaluated over time period, at any time point there is a partially evaluated composition prefix tree which operates on
rest of the sentence to be translated yet - these partial trees have placeholder templates that can be filledup by a future lambda function
from rest of the sentence.

Each of these lambda functions can be any of the following but not limited to:
- Boolean functions
- Generic mathematical functions
- Neural networks (which include all Semantic graphs like WordNet etc.,)
- Belief propagated potentials assigned by a dictionary of English language and computed bottom-up
- Experimental theory of Cognitive Psycholinguistics - Visuals of corresponding words - this is the closest simulation of process of cognition and comprehension because when a sentence is read by a human left-right, visuals corresponding to each word based on previous experience are evoked and collated in brain to create a "movie" meaning of the sentence. For example, following sentence:

	Mobile phones operate through towers in each cellular area that transmit signals.

with its per-word lambda function composition tree :

	in(operate(mobile phones, through(tower)), that(each(cellular area), transmit(signals)))

evokes from left-to-right visuals of Mobile phones, towers, a bounded area in quick succession based on user's personal "experience" which are merged to form a visual motion-pictured meaning of the sentence. Here "experience" is defined as the accumulated past stored in brain which differs from one person to the other. This evocation model based on an infinite hypergraph of stacked thoughts as vertices and edges has been described earlier in sections 35-49 and 54-59. This hypergraph of thoughts grows over time forming "experiences". For some words visual storage might be missing, blurred or may not exist at all. An example for this non-visualizable entity in above sentence is "transmit" and "signal" which is not a tangible. Thus the lambda function composition of these visuals are superimposed collations of individual lambda functions that return visuals specific to a word, to create a sum total animated version. Important to note is that these lambda functions are specific to each reader which depend on pre-built "experience" hypergraph of thoughts which differs for each reader. This explains the phenomenon where the process of learning and grasping varies among people. Hypergraph model also explains why recent events belonging to a particular category are evoked more easily than those in distant past - because nodes in stack can have associated potential which fades from top to down and evocation can be modelled as a hidden markov model process on a stack node in the thought hypergraph top-down as the markov chain. Rephasing, thoughts stored as multiplanar hypergraphs with stack vertices act as a context to reader-specific lambda functions. If stack nodes of thought hypergraph are not markov models - node at depth t need not imply node at depth t-1 - topmost node is the context disambiguating visual returned by the lambda function for that word. This unifies storage and computation and hence a plausible cerebral computational model - striking parallel in non-human turing computation is the virtual address space or tape for each process serving as context.

The language of Sanskrit with Panini's Grammar fits the above lambda calculus framework well because in Sanskrit case endings and sentence meaning are independent of word orderings. For example following sentence in Sanskrit:
	Sambhala Grama Mukhyasya VishnuYashas Mahatmana: ... ( Chieftain of Sambhala Village, Vishnuyashas the great ...)

can be rearranged and shuffled without altering the meaning, a precise requisite for lambda function composition tree representation of a sentence, which is tantamount to re-ordering of parameters of a lambda function.

As an alternative to WordNet:
----------------------------
Each lambda function carries dictionary meaning of corresponding word with placeholders for arguments.
For example, for word "Critical" corresponding lambda function is defined as:
	Critical(x1,x2)
If dictionary meanings of critical are defined with placeholders:
	1) Disapproval of something -
	2)  - is Important to something -
there is a need for disambiguation and 2) has to be chosen based either on number of arguments or disambiguation using lesk algorithm or more sophisticated one. If Second meaning fits context then, lambda function Critical(x1,x2) returns:
	x1 is important to something x2
Thus WordNet can be replaced by something more straightforward. These steps can be recursed top-down to expand the meaning - in above example "important" might have to be lookedup in dictionary. This simulates basic human process of language learning and comprehension.

This algorithm accepts natural languages that are between Context Free Languages and Context Sensitive Languages.

(FEATURE - DONE) Crucial commits for Performance improvements and Cython build of Spark Interview algorithm implementation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New setup.py has been added to do a Cythonized build of PySpark Interview algorithm MapReduce script
- Commandline for cython build: python setup.py build_ext --inplace
- This compiles python spark mapreduce script into a .c file that does CPython bindings and creates .o and .so files
- FreqDist has been commented which was slowing down the bootstrap
- MapReduce function has been updated for NULL object checks
- Thanks to Cython, Performance of Spark MapReduce has performance shootup by factor of almost 100x - Spark GUI job execution time
shown for this interview execution is ~10 seconds excluding GUI graph rendering which requires few minutes. This was earlier taking few hours.
- With Cython ,essentially Spark-Python becomes as fast as C implementation.

cluster.
- Above Cythonizes just a small percentage of Python-Spark code. If complete python execution path is Cythonized and JVM GC and Heap tunables for Spark are configured, this could increase throughput significantly further. Also Spark's shuffling parameters tuning could reduce the communication cost.

Further optimizations to Spark-Cython Interview algorithm implementation:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
- webspidered text for RGO graph construction updated
- PySpark-Cython build commandlines added as a text file log
- Commented unused python functions - shingling and jaccard coefficient
- threading.Lock() Spark thread pickling synchronizer variable made global in MapReducer
- renamed yesterday's logs and screenshot to correct datetime 4 February 2016
- Added a new special graph node ["None"] for special cases when no parents are found in backedges computation in MapReducer. This makes a
default root in the RGO graph as shown in matplotlib networkx graph plot
- Spark logs show time per RDD job - an example MapReduce job takes 335 milliseconds
- Tried Cythonizing InterviewAlgorithmWithIntrinisicMerit_Crawl_Visual_Spark.py but there is a serious cython compiler error in
Matplotlib-PyQt. Hence those changes have been backed out.
- DOT file and Cython C file have been updated

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
226. Commits as on 8 February 2016
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- PySpark-Cythonized Interview Algorithm implementation generated graph has been pruned to remove edges invoving "None" vertices which were
added during Spark MapReduce based on a config variable.
- Logs and Screenshots for the above have been added to testlogs/
- Some benchmark results parsed from the Spark logs with commandline - "for i in `grep Finished InterviewAlgorithmWithIntrinisicMerit_Crawl_Visual_Spark.2localthreads.CythonOptimized.8February2016.out |grep TaskSetManager| awk '{print $14}'`; do sum=$(expr $sum + $i); done":
	- Total time in milliseconds - 99201
	- Number of jobs - 113
	- Average time per mapreduce job in milliseconds - 877
Thus a merit computation of sample document with few lines (33 keywords) requires ~100 seconds in local Spark cluster. This excludes NetworkX and other unoptimized code overhead.

227. (THEORY) Graph Edit Distance in Interview Algorithm, PySpark-Cython Interview Algorithm benchmarks and Merit in Recursive Lambda Function Growth Algorithm
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interview Algorithm to assess merit, throughout this document, refers to 3 algorithms - Citation graph maxflow(which includes standard radius,eccentricity and diameter measures of the graph), Recursive Lambda Function growth and Graph edit distance (or Q&A) based interview between a pair of documents.  Recent result about impossibility of better algorithms for edit distance (Backurs-Indyk - http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0348 - edit distance cannot be computed in subquadratic time unless Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis is false) finds its applications in Graph edit distance for Interview Algorithm Questions&Answering where one document's Recursive Gloss Overlap graph is compared for distance from another graph's RGO WordNet subgraph (http://www.nist.gov/tac/publications/2010/participant.papers/CMI_IIT.proceedings.pdf). Graph edit distance is a special case of edit distance when graph edges are encoded as strings. A better algorithm to find edit distance between 2 documents' wordnet subgraphs ,therefore implies SETH is false.

Previous benchmarks for PySpark-Cython parallel interview algorithm implementation could scale significantly on a cluster with ~100 Spark nodes with parallel runtime of ~800 milliseconds. If all Java Spark code is JVM tuned and python modules are Cythonized fully, even this could be bettered bringing it to order of few milliseconds.

Computing Intrinsic Merit of a text with Recursive Lambda Function growth could involve multitude of complexity notions:
	- Depth of Composition tree for a text
	- Size of resultant lambda function composition e.g size of WordNet subgraphs, neural nets, complexity of context disambiguation with thought hypergraph psychological model enunciated in 222.
	- In essence, this reduces to a lowerbound of lambda function composition - boolean circuit lowerbounds are special cases of lambda function composition lowerbounds. Since thought hypergraph disambiguator is reader dependent, each reader might get different merit value for same document which explains the real-life phenomenon of "subjectivity". To put it simply, Objectivity evolves into Subjectivity with "experience and thought" context. Evaluating merit based on thought context is non-trivial because disambiguating a word visually as mentioned in 222 requires traversal of complete depth of thought hypergraph - it is like billions of stacks interconnected across making it tremendously multiplanar - a thought versioning system. This explains another realword phenomenon of experiential learning: An experienced person "views" a text differently from a relatively less experienced person.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
228. (THEORY) Thought Versioning - ThoughtNet and EventNet - Psychophilosophical Digression - Might have
some parallels in Philosophical Logic - related to points (70-79)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(*) This postulates an experimental model for a "Logical Brain". It makes no assumptions about neural synapses, firing etc., though a graph can be mapped to a neural network with some more reductions. The computation side is taken care of by Recursive Lambda Function Growth (which might invoke neural learning etc.,) while the storage is simulated with a giant ThoughtNet - together this is a turing-computable model for natural language processing which is subjective to each individual. This model makes an assumption of pre-existing consciousness or an equivalent to account for emotions and sentiments.

(*) ThoughtNet is built over time from inception of life - books a person reads, events in life, interactions etc., - are lambda-evaluated and stored. This is were the computation and storage distinction seems to vanish - It is not a machine and tape but rather a machinetape (analogy: space and time coalescing to spacetime). Evaluated lambda functions themselves are stored in ThoughtNet not just thoughts data - storage contains computation and computation looksup storage.

(*) Thought Versioning System - tentatively named ThoughtNet - mentioned in 227 is a generalization of Evocation WordNet as a multiplanar graph with stacked thoughts as vertices. Each stack corresponds to a class an experience or thought is binned - visually or non-visually.

(*) An approximate parallel to ThoughtNet versioning is the Overlay FileSystems in Unixen. Overlay filesystems store data one over the other in layers which play "obscurantist" and prevent the bottom truth from being out. This follows a Copy-up-on-write (CUOW) - a data in bottom layer is copied up and modified and stays overlaid. File access systems calls "see" only "topmost" layer. In ThoughtNet this roughly translates to Thought edges of particular class-stack node placed one over the other and grown over period of time. ThoughtNet thus presents an alternative to Overlay storage where a layer with maximum argmax() potential can be chosen.

(*) EventNet when unified with ThoughtNet makes a cosmic storage repository, all pervasive. Thoughts are stored with accompanied potentials - which could be electric potentials - some stronger thoughts might have heavy potentials compared to insignificant thoughts. How this potentials arise in first place is open to question. Rather than numeric and sign representation of sentiments, this ThoughtNet model proposes "coloring" of the emotions - akin to edge coloring of graphs. ThoughtNet is a giant pulp of accrued knowledge in the form of observed events stored as hyperedges. Here a distinction has to be made between Wisdom and Knowledge - Knowledge measures "To know" while Wisdom measures "To know how to know". Common knowledge in Logic ("We know that you know that We know ... ad infinitum") thus still does not explain wisdom (Does wisdom gain from knowledge and vicecersa?). ThoughtNet is only a knowledge representation and Wisdom remains open to interpretation - probably recursive lambda function growth fills-in this gap - it learns how to learn.

(*) For example, an event with pleasant happening might be stored with high potential of positive polarity as against a sad event with a negative polarity potential. Repetitive events with high potentials reinforce - potentials get added up. This extends SentiWordNet's concept of postivity, negativity and objectivity scoring for words. It is not a necessity that Hidden Markov Models are required for finding a right evocative (mentioned in 56). Trivial argmax(all potentials per stack class) is sufficient to find the most relevant evocative hyperedge. This explains the phenomenon where an extremely happy or sad memory of a class lingers for long duration despite being old whereas other memories of same class fade away though relatively recent. Emotions affecting potentials of thought hyperedges is explained further below.

(*) EventNet is a cosmic causality infinite graph with partaker nodes whereas ThoughtNet is per partaker node. This evocation model is experimental only because a void exists in this simulation which can be filledup only by consciousness and egoself. Example: A sentence "Something does not exist" implies it existed in past or might exist in future and thus self-refuting. Otherwise mention of "something" should have never happened.

(*) EventNet is a parallelly created Causality graph - event vertices occur in parallel across universe and causation edges are established in parallel. This is like a monte-carlo Randomized NC circuit that grows a random graph in parallel.

(*) Previous evocation model with HMM or maximum potential need not be error-free - it can be derailed since human understanding at times can be derailed - because humans are inherently vulnerable to misunderstand ambiguous texts. Hence above evocation might return a set of edges than a unique edge which has to be further resolved by additional information for disambiguation. For example, rather than individual words a sentence as a block might require disambiguation: In the Cognitive Psycholinguistics model which stores thoughts as visuals mentioned in 222, there is a chance of derailment because of evocation returning multiple edges when human emotions are involved (Love, Anger, Sarcasm, Pathos etc.,). ThoughNet based disambiguation simulates subjective human reasoning more qualitatively specific to each individual and accurately than usual statistical sentiment inferences which are mere numbers and do not consider individual specific perception of a text. This also explains how an "image"/"perception" is engineered over a time period which depends on thoughts stored.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Thought experiment for this defective disambiguation is as below
-----------------------------------------------------------------
(*) Example Sentence 1: "Love at first sight is the best". Considering two persons reading this sentence with drastically different ThoughtNet contexts - one person has multiple good followed by bad experiences stored as ThoughtNet hypergraph edges with stronger postive and negative potentials and the argmax() disambiguated evocative edges returned could be therefore both quite positive and negative inducing him to either like or abhor this sentence based on whichever wins the mind conflict (i.e whichever potential positive or negative is overpowering), while the other person has a pure romantic history with good experiences alone disambiguated evocation in which case is uniquely positive. This is real-world simulation of "confused" thought process when emotions rule. In other words emotions determine the polarity and extent of potentials tagged to each thought hyperedge and more the emotional conflict, larger the chance of difficulty in unique disambiguation and derailment. It is not a problem with ThoughtNet model,but it is fundamental humane problem of emotions which spill over to ThoughtNet when accounted for. If human reasoning is ambiguous so is this model. This danger is even more pronounced when lambda compositions of visuals are involved than just sentences. As an example, a test human subject is repeatedly shown visuals related to love reinforcing the potentials of hyperedges belonging to a class of "Love" and subject is bootstrapped for future realtime love. This artificially creates an illusory backdrop of "trained data" ThoughtNet context - a kind of "Prison Experiment for Behavioural Modification Under Duress" - the distinction between reality and imagination gets blurred - e.g Stanford Prison Experiment. Machine learning programs cannot quantify emotions through statistics (in the absence of data about how emotions are stored in brain, does emotion originate from consciousness etc.,) and hence creating a visualized meaning through recursive lambda composition of natural language texts have a void to fill. If emotions are Turing-computable, the lambda function composition makes sense. ThoughtNet model with potentials, thus, simulates human grasp of a text with provisions for emotions. No existing machine learning model at present is known to reckon emotions and thought contexts.

(*) Example Sentence 2: "You are too good for any contest". This sentence has sarcastic tone for a human reader. But can sarcasm be quantified and learned? Usual statistical machine learning algorithms doing sentiment analysis of this sentence might just determine positivity, negativity or objectivity ignoring other fine-grained polarities like "rave, ugly, pejorative, sarcastic etc.,". Trivial sentiment analysis rates this as positive while for a human it is humiliating. This is an example when lambda composition of visuals fares better compared to textual words. Visually this lambda-composes to a collated thought-enacted movie of one person talking to another having a discourteous, ridiculing facial expression. Lambda functions for this visual compositions could invoke face-feature-vector-recognition algorithms which identify facial expressions. In social media texting smileys(emoticons) convey emotions (e.g tongue-in-cheek). Thus disambiguating the above text sentence accurately depends on a pre-existing visually stored ThoughtNet context of similar sarcastic nature - a person with prior visual ThoughtNet experience hyperedge similar to sarcastic sentence above is more capable of deciphering sarcasm than person without it. This prior edge is "training data" for the model and is stored with an edge-coloring of configurable choosing. Marking sentiments of Thought edges with edge coloring is more qualitative and coarse grained than numbering - each of the emotions Love, Hate, Sorrow, Divinity etc can be assigned a color. As ThoughtNet is grown from beginning of life, stacked up thoughts are colored where the sentiment coloring is learnt from environment. For example, first time a person encounters the above sentence he may not be familiar with sarcasm, but he might learn it is sarcastic from an acquaintance and this learning is stored with a "sarcastic" sentiment coloring in multiplanar thoughtnet hypergraph. Intensity of coloring determines the strength of thought stored. Next instances of evocations ,for example "too good" and "contest" which is the crucial segment, return the above edge if intensely colored (in a complex setting, the lambda composition tree is returned ,not just the sentence).

(*) Example Poetry 3 - lambda evaluation with shuffled connectives, is shown below with nested parenthesization - Each parenthesis scope evaluates a lambda function and composed to a tree - [Walrus-Carpenter - Alice in Wonderland]:
(("The time has come,") (the Walrus said),
("To talk of many things:)
(Of shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax--)
(Of cabbages--and kings--)
And (why (the sea is boiling hot--))
And (whether (pigs have wings.")))
This lambda composition itself can be classified in classes viz., "time", "poetry", "sea" etc., (in special case of gloss overlap this is easy to classify by computing high core numbers of the graph). Above evaluation itself is stored in ThoughtNet as hyperedge in its entirety as the "meta-learning", and not just "knowledge",and an edge coloring for sentiment can be assigned. During future evocation, say utterance of word "time", the edge returned is the most intensely colored edge.

(*) Perfect design of Psycholinguistic text comprehension must involve ego-centric theory specific to each reader as mentioned previously. Combining EventNet and ThoughtNet throws another challenge: When did ThoughtNet begin? Who was the primordial seed of thought? EventNet on the other hand can be axiomatically assumed to have born during BigBang Hyperinflation and the resultant "ultimate free lunch". Invoking Anthropic principle - "I think,therefore I am", "I exist because I am supposed to exist" etc., - suggests the other way i.e EventNet began from ThoughtNet. Then, did consciousness create universe? Quoting an Indological text - Hymn of creation - Nasadiya Sukta - "Even non-existence did not exist in the beginning" which concurs with aforementioned paradoxes. This theorizes duality arose from singularity throwing spanner into spokes of linguistics which are based on duality of synonyms and antonyms. That is a glaringly discordant note in achieving a perfect artificial intelligence. Thus conscious robot may never be a reality.

(*) Above exposition is required to get to the bottom of difficulties in formalising "what is meant by meaning" and "intrinsic merit" in perfect sense. Graph theoretic intrinsic merit algorithms might require quantum mechanical concepts like Bose-Einstein condensate mentioned in 18.10 i.e In recursive gloss overlap graph context, word vertices are energy levels and edges amongst words are subatomic particles.

(*) If ThoughtNet begot EventNet by anthropic principle, there is a possibility language was born before something existed in reality. For example, word "Earth" existed before Earth was created. This presents another circular paradox - ThoughtNet implies EventNet implies ThoughtNet ... because events create thoughts and anthropic principle implies thought created events. This also implies thought created brain and its constituents which in turn think and "understand meaning" of a text - sort of Supreme consciousness splitting itself into individual consciousness.

(*) Another counterexample: A cretan paradox like sentence - "This sentence is a lie" - which is true if it is false and false if true - Lambda function composition algorithm is beyond the scope of such sentences. This sentence exhibits 2 levels of truths and falsehoods - Truth/Falsehood  within a sentence and Truth/Falsehood outside the sentence - in former observer and observed are one and the same and in the latter observer stands aloof from observed

(*) If there are two levels of Truth/Falsehoods similar to stratified realities defined in https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/UndecidabilityOfFewNonTrivialQuestions.pdf, above paradox "This sentence is a lie" ican be analyzed (kind of Godel sentence proving languages are incomplete) as below with TRUE/FALSE and true/false being two levels of this nest:
	- This sentence is a lie - true - self-refuting and circular
	- This sentence is a lie - TRUE - not self-refuting because TRUE transcends "true"
	- This sentence is a lie - false - self-refuting and circular
	- This sentence is a lie - FALSE - not self-refuting because FALSE transcends "false"

(*) (QUITE PRESUMPTIVE, THIS MIGHT HAVE A PARALLEL IN LOGIC BUT COULDN'T FIND IT) In other words, the sentence "(It is TRUE that (this sentence is a lie))" is different from "(It is true that this sentence is a lie)" - in the former the observer is independent of observed sentence (complete) where as in the latter observer and observed coalesce (incomplete) - TRUE in former has scope beyond the inner sentence while true in latter is scope-restricted to the inner sentence. If Truth and Falsehood are scoped with a universe of discourse, above paradox seems to get reconciled and looks like an extension of Incompleteness theorems in logic. Natural languages and even Formal Logic have only one level of boolean truth/falsehood and thus previous is mere a theoretical fancy.

(*) Above philosophical dissection of meaning has striking similarities to quantum mechanics - If language has substructure abiding by quantum mechanics [e.g Bose-Einstein model for recursive gloss overlap wordnet subgraph], the links across words which correspond to subatomic particles must obey Heisenberg uncertainty principle also i.e As a linguistic parallel, 100% accurate meaning may never be found by any model of computation. This can not be ruled out if network is a random graph with probabilities for edges.

(*) Levels of Truth are reminiscent of Tarski's Undefinability of Truth Theorem - https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel-incompleteness/#TarTheUndTru - There are two levels of languages - Inner Object Language and Outer Meta Language - Truth of statements in inner object languages are determined in outer meta language. An example sentence in object language is the Cretan Paradox - "All cretans are liars". In previous example, "this sentence is a lie" is defined in object language (English) and is a self-referential Goedel sentence. Truth of this sentence has to be decided in metalanguage. Another example paradox sentence in object language is: "This is bigger than the biggest". Can truth of this be determined in object language? This can be geometrically interpreted: If object language and metalanguage are vector spaces of dimensions k and k+l, any sentence in object language is a vector of dimension k (e.g word2vec representation extended to sentence2vec) and truth of it has to be decided in metalanguage space of dimensions k+l. In object language space there can not be an entity bigger than biggest - e.g set of concentric circles limited by outermost circle and truth of this sentence is "False". But when this sentence is projected to a k+l metalanguage vector space, a circle "bigger" in k+l dimension vectorspace can exist, than the "biggest" circle in k dimension vectorspace and truth is "True". Example of dimensions in a natural language are Parts-of-Speech.

229. (THEORY) Bose-Einstein Condensate model for Recursive Gloss Overlap based Classification
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bose-Einstein condensate fitness model by [Ginestra Bianconi] described in 18.10 for any complex network graph is:
	Fitness of a vertex = 2^(-b*Energy) where b is a Bose-Einstein condensate function.

Here fitness of a vertex is defined as ability to attract links to itself - Star complexity. It is not known if ability of a word to attract links from other words is same as intrinsic merit of a document in recursive gloss overlap context - prima facie both look equal. As energy of a node decreases, it attracts increased number of node edges. In Recursive Gloss Overlap graph, node with maximum core number or PageRank must have lowest energy and hence the Fittest. Previous equation is by applying Einstein derivation of Satyendranath Bose's Planck's formula for Quantum mechanics where in a critical temperature above zero kelvin most of the particles "condense" in lowest energy level. This was proved in 1995-2001 by NIST lab (http://bec.nist.gov/).

Applying the above model to a relational graph obtained from text document implies graph theoretic representation of language has lurking quantum mechanical traits which should apply to all semantic graphs and ontologies viz.,WordNet, ConceptNet etc.,. For example, when a winner word vertex takes all links to other words, the winner word becomes a dictator and thus the only class a document can belong to. Thus Bose-Einstein condensate can be mapped to a Dictator boolean function. This should ideally be extensible to structural complexity of circuit graphs i.e gate within a neural net TC circuit version of WordNet with maximum fanin and fanout has lowest energy where neighbours flock. If energy implies information entropy in a document, low energy implies low entropy of a text i.e sigma(p log p) of a text as bag of words probability distribution, decreases as text document increasingly becomes less chaotic and vice-versa holds too. As a document becomes more chaotic with high entropy and energy, fitness per word vertex decreases as there are multiple energy centres within it. Hence low entropy is equivalent to presence of a high fitness word vertex in the graph.

Analogy: Recursive Gloss Overlap graph can be construed as a 3 dimensional rubbersheet with low energy words as troughs. Deepest troughs are words (lowest energy levels) that classify a document.

230. (THEORY) Expander Graphs, Bose-Einstein Condensate Fitness model and Intrinsic Merit
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Edge expander graphs are defined with Cheeger's constant for minimum high edge boundary per vertex subset:
	minimum(|boundary(S)|/|S|), 1 < |S| < n/2
where boundary(S) of a subset S of vertices of G (V(G)) is:
	boundary(S) = { (u,v) | u in S, v in V(G) \ S}
From Bose-Einstein condensate fitness model, ability of a vertex to attract links increases with decreasing energy of a vertex. This implies
boundary(S) expands with presence of low energy vertices. Thus Bose-Einstein condensate model translates into an edge expander construction. Also high expansion implies high star complexity. Recursive Gloss Overlap graph with a low energy vertex is a high edge expander and easiliy classifiable to a topic with core numbers.

Measuring intrinsic merit (and therefore fitness if both are equivalent concepts) by edge expansion (Cheeger's constant) over and above usual connectivity measures formalises a stronger notion of "meaningfulness" of a text document. For example High Cheeger's constant of RGO graph implies high intrinsic merit of a text.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
231. (THEORY) Sentiment analysis and ThoughtNet Continuum - Fine grained emotions and evocation - related to 228
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(*) ThoughtNet need not be a discrete hypergraph but a continuum of edges and nodes. Analogy: Set of countably infinite natural numbers and continuum of uncountably infinite reals. It is difficult to visualize a continuum as a graph - no graph theoretic gadget exists for a continuum graph - Infinite graph is countable, Continuum graph is uncountable. By diagonalization, continuum could be as hard as halting problem.
(*) Each feature of a visual thought is a class stack node in ThoughtNet. Number of features per visual could be thousands. Visual is flattened
into a hyperedge across class stack nodes corresponding to feature vector vertices.
---------------------
(*) Example schematic:
----------------------
		-------->Lambda computation---------
returns		|				   |  stores thought hyperedges
evocatives	|				   |
		---------ThoughtNet <---------------
(*) Colors of Thought hyperedges are determined by sentimentality of class stack nodes. The class stack nodes are colored too, not just edges. If an edge transcends various colored class stack nodes, resultant color of thought hyperedge is a function of colors of constituent class stack nodes:
	Edge sentiment color of ThoughtNet Hyperedge = weight_function(node colors in the hyperedge).
(*) Node colors are priors. How these priors are decided for each class stack node is the mainstay of emotional inference. This requires assumption of Desire/Prejudice/Bounded Rationality/Irrational Exuberance arising from Consciousness or equivalent. This irrationality creates a pre-conceived potential per class stack node, though no edges may be part of the class at all. Irrationality has to be assumed to be an independent variable and atomic because if it is not, what it depends on is a question. Though previous inquisition on Sentiments, Meaning et al border on Theology, it is inevitable to exclude the emotional root causes while working on a close-to-perfect mathematical simulation of human sentiments.

- Only Direct download from Princeton WordNet 3.0 works with WNHOME.
- Tcl/Tk 8.6 is prerequisite and there is a build error "missing result field in Tk_Inter" in /usr/include/tcl8.6/tcl.h. Remedy is to enable USE_INTERP_RESULT flag with macro: #define USE_INTERP_RESULT  1 in this header and then do:
	make Makefile.PL
	make
	make install

235. (THEORY) Dream Sentiment Analysis with ThoughtNet - related to 18 and 228
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dream Analysis in http://cogprints.org/5030/1/NRC-48725.pdf (mentioned in 18.8) scores dreams based on polarity with bag of words representation- dreams are known to be related to Limbic and Paralimbic systems in brain. Insofar as theories pertaining to ThoughtNet described in 18 and 228 are concerned, only conscious evocatives arising from events are described. Going a step further, can ThoughtNet account for interpretation of dreams? Dreams, psychologically, are known to be vagaries of suppressed thoughts manifesting in subsconscious state. ThoughtNet stores thoughts of experiences,visuals and events as hyperedges consciously. A dream model is proposed where in subsconscious/RapidEyeMovement state, Thought hyperedges momentarily disintegrate and re-arrange to form new edges manifesting as dream visuals. Once dream expires, these dream edges are dissolved and original ThoughtNet is restored. Before dissolution, dream might be stored if potentially strong. This explains why some dreams linger after wakeup. Caveat: this is just a theory of dream analysis based on some thought experimentation and has no scientific backing. This model makes an assumption that dream hyperedges are functions of preexisting ThoughtNet hyperedges which is not quite right because there are exceptional phenomena like extra-sensory perception where visions of future are observed by few individuals which could not have arisen from past experience and thoughts. ESP implies brain has faculty to foresee inherently in a superconsicous state which is subdued in normal conscious state. It is more accurate to say that dream hyperedges are functions of both past thought hyperedges and superconscious hidden variables which might explain ESP.

236. (THEORY) Regularity Lemma and Ramsey Number of Recursive Gloss Overlap graph and ThoughtNet
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Throughout this document, ranking of documents which is so far a pure statistical and machine learning problem is viewed from Graph Theory and Lambda Function growth perspective - theory invades what was till now engineering.  Both Regularity Lemma and Ramsey theory elucidate order in large graphs. Regularity Lemma has a notion of density which is defined as:
	d(V1, V2) = |E(V1, V2)|/|V1||V2|
where V1 and V2 are subsets of vertices V(G) for a graph G and E(V1,V2) are edges among subsets V1 and V2. Density is a quantitative measure of graph complexity and intrinsic connectedness merit of a text document. Ramsey Number R(a,b) of a graph is the least number such that there always exists a graph of vertex order R(a,b) with a clique of size a or an independent set of size b. Typically associated with "Party problem" where it is required to find minimum number of people to be invited so that a people know each other or b people do not know each other, Ramsey number of ThoughtNet sentiment colorings - e.g bipartisan red-blue colorings for 2 thought hyperedge sentiment polarities - provides a theoretical bound on size of ThoughtNet as such so that order arises in a motley mix of emotionally tagged thoughts - a clique of similar sentimental edges emerges. Similar application of Ramsey number holds good for Recursive Gloss Overlap graph also - a document's graph can have cliques and independent sets with vertex colorings for word sentiments.

    - Some bugs resolved
    - Added one more example with no pattern
    - Convolution is computed for all 3 bitmap examples
    - Final neuron layer now is a function of each point in all maxpooling layers
    - The existence of pattern is identified by the final output of each of 10 neurons
    - Patterns 0 and 3 have a greater neural value than no pattern. Gradation of neural value indicates intensity of pattern.
    - Above is a very fundamental pattern recognition for 2 dimensional data. Sophisticated deconvolution is explained in http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2901 which reverse engineers pooling layers with Unpooling.

239. (THEORY) Deep Learning Convolution Network and a boolean function learning algorithm of different kind
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deep Learning Convolution Network for Image Pattern Recognition elicits features from the image considered as 2-dimensional array. In the
Deep Learning implementation in python-src/ image is represented as {0,1}* bitmap blob. Each row of this bit map can be construed as satisfying assignment to some boolean function to be learnt. Thus the 2-dimensional bitmap is set of assignments satisfying a boolean function - A boolean function learnt from this data - by some standard algorithms viz., PAC learning, Hastad-Linial-Mansour-Nisan fourier coefficient concentration bounds and low-degree polynomial approximation (learning phase averages the coefficients from all sample points and prediction phase uses this averaged fourier coefficient) - accepts the image as input. Deep Learning Convolution Network is thus equivalent to a boolean function learnt from an image - quite similar to HMLN low-degree learning, deep learning convolution also does weighted averaging in local receptive field feature kernel map layers, maxpooling layer and final neuron layers with binary output. Essentially convolution learns a TC circuit. It presupposes existence of set of satisfying assignments which by itself is a #P-complete problem. This connects two hitherto unrelated concepts - Image Recognition and Satisifiability - into a learning theory algorithm for 2-dimensional binary data. Same learning theory approach may not work for BackPropagation which depend on 4 standard Partial Differential Equations.

241. (THEORY and IMPLEMENTATION) ThoughtNet and Reinforcement Learning
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reinforcement Learning is based on following schematic principle of interaction between environment and agent learning from environment. ThoughtNet described in 228 and previous is an environmental context that every human agent has access to in decision making. This makes human thought process and thought-driven-actions to be a special case of Reinforcement Learning. Reinforcement Learning is itself inspired by behavioural psychology.

				---------> ThoughtNet context (environment) ------
	action (evocation)	|				  		 |  reward and state transition (most potent evocative thought)
				|<----------- Text Document (agent) ------<----- |

Schematic above illustrates text document study as reinforcement learning. During left-right reading of text, evocation action is taken per-word which accesses ThoughtNet storage and returns a reward which is the strongest thought edge. State transition after each evocation is the partially evaluated lambda composition prefix mentioned in 222 - this prefix is updated after reading each word left-right. Human practical reading is most of the time lopsided - it is not exactly left-right but eye observes catchy keywords and swivels/oscillates around those pivots creating a balanced composition tree. Error in disambiguation can be simulated with a model similar to what is known as "Huygen's Gambler's Ruin Theorem" which avers that in any Gambling/Betting game, player always has a non-zero probability of becoming insolvent - this is through a Bernoulli trial sequence as below with fair coin toss (probability=0.5):
	- 1) First coin flip - Pr(doubling1) = 0.5, Pr(bankrupt1) = 0.5
	- 2) Second coin flip - Pr(bankrupt2) = Pr(bankrupt1)*0.5 = 0.25
	- 3) Third coin flip - Pr(bankrupt3) = Pr(bankrupt2)*0.5 = 0.125
	....
By union bound probability of gambler going bankrupt after infinite number of coin flips is 1. This convergence to 1 applies to unfair biased coin tosses also. This theorem has useful application in ThoughtNet reinforcement learning disambiguation. Reward is defined as probability of most potent evocative thought being retrieved from ThoughtNet (this is when return value is set of hyperedges and not unique - probability of reward is 1/size_of_set_returned) and state transition is akin to consecutive coin flips. This proves that probability of imperfect disambiguation is eventually 1 even though reward probability is quite close to 1.

A ThoughtNet Reinforcement Learning implementation has been committed as part of python-src/DeepLearning_ReinforcementLearningMonteCarlo.py

246. (THEORY) Learning a variant of Differential Privacy in Social networks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nicknames/UserIds in social media are assumed to be unique to an individual. Authentication and authorization with Public-Key Infrastructure
is assumed to guarantee unique identification. In an exceptional case, if more than one person shares a userid intentionally or because of cybercrime to portray a false picture of other end, is it possible to distinguish and learn such spoof behaviour? This is a direct opposite of differential privacy [Cynthia Dwork - http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/64346/dwork.pdf] where 2 databases differing in one element are indistinguishable to queries by a randomized algorithm with coin tosses. But in previous example of shared id(s) in social network, distinguisher should be able to discern the cases when a remote id is genuine and spoofed/shared - probably suitable name for it is Differential Identification. This can theoretically happen despite all PKI security measures in place when id is intentionally shared i.e a coalition of people decide to hoodwink PKI by sharing credentials and the receiving end sees them as one. For example, if a chat id is compromised by a coalition, the chat transcript is no longer credible reflection of the other end, and receiving end may not be aware of this at all. Here chat transcript is a mix of both genuine and spoofed portrayal of other end. An example statistical Learning algorithm for distinguishing when spoof happened analyzes the chat transcript conversations with genuine chat as priors if there is a prior available. Non-statistically, it is not known how a boolean function learner would look like for this example. A special case is when a coalition is unnecessary. The remote end can be a single individual garnering collective wisdom from multiple sources to present a deceptive portrayal of multitude.

248. (FEATURE-BENCHMARK-DONE) Intrinsic Merit PySpark-Cython implementation - With and Without cacheing
- Commits as on 25 March 2016
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Cache md5 hashkey has been changed to be the complete tuple (tokensofprevlevel,keyword) - the rationale is to have perfect
uniqueness to find backvertices for a keyword and gloss from previous recursion step.
2.Following benchmark was done by disabling and enabling lookupCache and lookupCacheParents boolean flags.
3.Cache values are "Novalue" string literals by default initialized in lambda and the Cache updates are not append()s but
simple key-value assignments.

Number of keywords: 7
Without Cacheing: 9 minutes for all tasks (including NetworkX and graphics rendering times which is quite considerable)
With Cacheing: 9 minutes for all tasks (including NetworkX and graphics rendering times which is quite considerable)

Summation of individual task times in milliseconds and averaging sometimes gives misleadingly high duration per task though
total execution is faster. Because of this start-end time duration is measured. For above example Cacheing has no effect because
there are no repetitions cached to do lookup. Logs and screenshots with and without cacheing have been committed to testlogs/

249. (THEORY) An alternative USTCONN LogSpace algorithm for constructing Recursive Gloss Overlap Graph
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Benchmarks above are selected best from multiple executions. Sometimes a mysterious slowdown was observed with both CPUs clocking 100%
load which could be result of JVM Garbage Collection for Spark processes among others. These benchmarks are thus just for assessing feasibility of Spark clustering only and a perfect benchmark might require a cloud of few thousand nodes for a crawled webpage. At present there is no known standard algorithm to convert a natural language text to a relational graph without WordNet and internally looking up some *Net ontology to get path relations between two words could be indispensable theoretically speaking. This is the reverse process of Graph Traversals - Breadth First and Depth First - traversal is the input text and a graph has to be extracted from it. For n keywords, there are n^2 ordered pairs of word vertices possible for each of which WordNet paths have to be found. This is Undirected ST Connectivity in graphs for which there are quite a few algorithms known right from [Savitch] theorem upto [OmerReingold] ZigZag product based algorithm in logspace. This is more optimal compared to all pairs shortest paths on WordNet. This algorithm does not do deep learning recursion top-down to learn a graph from text. For all pairs this is  better than O(n^3) which is upperbound for All Pairs Shortest Paths. These n^2 pairs of paths overlap and intersect to create a graph. Presently implemented Recursive Gloss Overlap learns deeper than all pairs USTCONN algorithm because it uses "superinstance" notion - whether x is in definition of y - something absent in WordNet jargon. This algorithm is quadratic in number of words where as Recursive Gloss Overlap is linear - O(n*d*s^tmax/cpus) - counterintuitively.

- New subroutine for printing WordNet Synset Path between 2 words - this prints edges related by hypernyms and hyponyms
- an example log has been committed in testlogs/

From the example path in logs, distance is more of a metapath than a thesaurus-like path implemented in Recursive Gloss Overlap in NeuronRain. Due to this limitation of WordNet hyper-hyponyms the usual unsupervised classifier based on core numbers of the graph translated from text would not work as accurately with straightforward WordNet paths. This necessitates the superinstance relation which relates two words k and l: k is in definition of l.

- spark-defaults2.conf has been enabled with extra java options for performance (reference: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/java.html)
- lookupCache and lookupCacheParents boolean flags have been done away with because memcache has been enabled by default for subgraph cacheing
- With this spark logs show more concurrency and less latency. Dynamic allocation was in conflict with number of executors and executors has been hence commented in spark-defaults2.conf
- text document has been updated to have ~10 keywords. This took almost 7 minutes which looks better than one with spark-defaults.conf disabled

Loopless Map function for Spark_MapReduce()
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- new Map function MapFunction2() has been defined which doesn't loop through all keywords per level, but does the glossification per keyword
which is aggregated by Reduce step. MapFunction() does for loop for all keywords per level.
- a dictionary cacheing with graphcachelocal has been done for lookup of already gloss-tokenized keywords. This couldn't be memcached due to a weird error that resets the graphcachelocal to a null which shouldn't have.
- This has a execution time of 6 minutes overall for all tasks compared to for-loop Map function in Spark_MapReduce().

and in its expanded form as:
	sigma(rho^|S|*(1/2^n*sigma(|f(x)|^q*(-1)^(parity(xi))))^(1/q)*parity(S)) <= (1/2^n*sigma(|f(x)|^p)^(1/p)
Hypercontractivity upperbounds a noisy function's q-norm by same function's p-norm without noise. For 2-norm, by Parseval's theorem which gives 2-norm as sigma(f(S)^2), hypercontractivity can be directly applied to Denoisification in 53.11 and 53.12 as it connects noisy and noiseless boolean function norms.

255. (THEORY) Hypercontractivity, KKL inequality,Social choice boolean functions  - Denoisification 3
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For 2-norm, Bonami-Beckner inequality becomes:
	sigma[(rho^|S|*fourier_coeff(S)^2)^(2/2)] <= [1/2^n*(sigma(f(x)^p)^2/p)]

For boolean functions f:{0,1}^n -> {-1,0,1}, [Kahn-Kalai-Linial] inequality is special case of previous:
	For rho=p-1 and p=1+delta, sigma(delta^|S|*fourier_coeff(S)^2) <= (Pr[f!=0])^2/(1+delta)
where p-norm is nothing but a norm on probability that f is non-zero (because Pr[f!=0] is a mean of all possible f(x) at 2^n points).

From 53.12 size of a noisy boolean function circuit has been bounded as: Summation(rho^|S|*fourier_coeff(S)^2) * 2^((t^(1/d)/20)-1) <= Size
for |S| > t. From KKL inequality, 2-norm in LHS can be set to maximum of (Pr[f!=0])^2/(1+delta) in 53.12 and Size lowerbound is obtained for
a denoisified circuit:
	(Pr[f!=0])^2/(1+delta) * 2^((t^(1/d)/20)-1) <= Size
which is exponential when delta=1 and Pr[f!=0] is quite close to 1 i.e f is 1 or -1 for most of the inputs.

If f is 100% noise stable, from Plancherel theorem:
	sigma(rho^|S|*f(S)^2) = 1, S in [n]
	For |S| < t=n, 1-Summation(rho^|S|*fourier_coeff(S)^2) <= 2*(Size)*2^(-t^(1/d)/20)
	But for rho=p-1 and p=1+delta, 1-Summation(delta^|S|*fourier_coeff(S)^2) >  1-(Pr[f!=0])^2/(1+delta) from KKL inequality.
	For |S| < t=n,  1-(Pr[f!=0])^2/(1+delta) < 1-Summation(rho^|S|*fourier_coeff(S)^2) <= 2*(Size)*2^(-t^(1/d)/20)
=>  0.5*(1-(Pr[f!=0])^2/(1+delta))*2^(t^(1/d)/20) < 0.5*(1-Summation(rho^|S|*fourier_coeff(S)^2))*2^(t^(1/d)/20) <= Size

Again denoisification by letting rho and delta tend to 0 in above, places an exponential lowerbound, with constant upperbound on depth, on a noiseless circuit size. In above size bound Lt n^(1/n) = 1 for n tending to infinity (Real analysis result - http://www.jpetrie.net/2014/10/12/proof-that-the-limit-as-n-approaches-infinity-of-n1n-1-lim_n-to-infty-n1n-1/). Percolation in 100% noise stable regime can have NC/poly circuits while above stipulates the lowerbound for noiseless circuits to be exponential when depth is constant. It implies NC/Poly formulation of percolation has unrestricted depth which is obvious because 100% noise stability regime is attained when n tends to infinity. Randomized algorithm equivalent of Percolation implies Percolation is in RP or RNC with pseudorandom advice which vindicates derandomized NC representation for percolation. This leads to an important result if 100% stability implies lowerbound: LHS is an NC/Poly Percolation circuit in 100% noise stability regime of polynomial size. RHS is exponential, denoisified, 100% stable circuit of arbitrary hardness. From 53.9 and 53.16, RHS has an NC/Poly lowerbound e.g if RHS is PH-complete then PH in P/poly. From Toda's theorem, PH is in P^#P and there is a known result that P^#P in P/Poly implies P^#P = MA. Unifying:
PH in P^#P in P/Poly => P^#P=MA. (assumption: NC/Poly is in P/Poly because any logdepth, polysize bounded fanin circuit has polysize gates)
NC/log percolation circuit would imply collapse of polynomial hierarchy - RHS PH-complete is lowerbounded by LHS NC/log in P and trivially P=NP.

Percolation boolean functions have a notion of revealment - that is, there exists a randomized algorithm corresponding to each percolation boolean function which has coin toss advice to query the next bit and revealment is the maximum probability that a bit index i in [n] is queried in these sets of bits B in [n]- it reveals the secret in randomness. Thus LHS Percolation in Pr(Good) circuit can be simulated by a randomized algorithm with revealment. In such a case, advice strings are random coin tosses. This revealment has close resemblance to random restrictions - each restriction brings down a variable by revealing it finally leading to a constant function. Following theorem connects Fourier weights of percolation and Randomized revealments:
	Sigma(fourier_coeff(S)^2) <= revealment*constant*2-norm(f)

There is a special case in which size of advice list can be brought down to logn from n for Z(n) grid. Set of logn points are pseudorandomly chosen from n points. This logn sized subset when sorted would still point to left-right trend unless leftmost and rightmost are not in sample. This places Percolation in NC/log which could imply a PH collapse mentioned previously. This is an exponential decrease in size of advice.

256. (THEORY) Majority Voting in Multipartisan Elections
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Uptill now, P(Good) majority voting in this document describes only 2-candidate elections with a majority function voting circuit.
Noise stability of a voter's decision boolean function is assumed as a suitable measure of voter/voting error in RHS of P(Good) summation. Most
generic RHS is when there is a multiway contest and error is bounded. P(Good) binomial summation still applies for multipartisan democracy because voter decision vector (set of binary decision bits of all voters - in {Good,Bad}*) remains same though number of candidates increase manifold. Differences are in:
	- Individual Voter Judging Functions which are not boolean functions and
	- Generic Majority Function that needs to find most prominent index from an assorted mix of votes (Heavy hitter) - might require Sorting Networks on Hashvalues.
	- There are three variables - number of variables per voter, number of voters and number of candidates (which is 2 in boolean decision functions special case for fixed 2 candidate elections) and these numbers can be arbitrarily huge - in the order of Graham's number for example.

Voter judging functions have to choose an index within n candidates than simple 0-1. In a special case non-boolean functions can be simulated by a functional aggregation of boolean functions e.g Voted Candidate index in binary representation is nothing but a logN sized binary string of 0-1 output gates from multiple boolean functions for maximum of N candidates. Measuring how good is the choice made by a multiway voter decision function has no equivalent notion of stability and sensitivity in non-boolean functions. For 2 voters 0-1 boolean function is sufficient. Multiparty Generic Majority Function without tie in which candidates are hashkeys and votes are hashvalues can be shown to be NP-complete from Money Changing Problem and 0-1 Integer Linear Programming(https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/IntegerPartitionAndHashFunctions_2014.pdf). [Friedgut-Kalai-Nisan] theorem is quantitative extension of Arrow's Theorem and Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem which prove that there is a non-zero probability that elections with 3 candidates and more can be manipulated. This appears sufficient to prove that Goodness probability of a multiway contest in RHS of P(good) binomial summation can never converge to 100% implying that democracy is deficient. This non-constructively shows the impossibility without even knowing individual voter error and series summation. Interestingly, this divergence condition coincides with contradiction mentioned in 53.16.3.1 for PARITY3SAT superpolynomial size circuits. Assuming an NC/Poly or P/Poly LHS Percolation Boolean Function with 100% noise stability in P(Good) LHS, Multiway Election in RHS can be placed in hardest known complexity classes - Polynomial Hierarchy PH, EXPSPACE - *) for PH it is expoential DC-uniform circuit size required by RHS *) for adversarial simulation by Chess,Go etc., it is EXPTIME-hard required by RHS etc.,. This fits into scenario 53.9.5 when LHS is 100% stable circuit and RHS is unstable PH=DC circuit.

- Updated AsFer Design Document - KKL inequality and Denoisification
- Spark-Cython intrinsic merit computation has been md5hash enabled again since there were key errors with large strings
- logs and screenshots have been committed to testlogs/
- rebuilt Cython .c, .so files

258. (FEATURE-BENCHMARK-DONE) Analysis of PySpark-Cython Intrinsic Merit Computation Benchmarks done so far
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From 191 and 201 time complexity analysis of Recursive Gloss Overlap algorithm, for single node dualcore cluster following is the
runtime bound:
	O(n*d*s^tmax/cpus)
where d is the number of keywords, n is the number of documents and s is the maximum gloss size per keyword. For last two benchmarks done with
MD5 hashkeys, Local Cacheing and Global Cacheing(MemCached) enabled number of words are 10 and 40. Corresponding runtimes are:
--------------
10 words
--------------
n=1
d=10
s=constant
tmax=2 (depth 2 recursion)
cpus=2 (dual core)
Runtime = 7 minutes = k*10*(s)^2/2
--------------
40 words
--------------
n=1
d=40
s=constant
tmax=2 (depth 2 recursion)
cpus=2 (dual core)
Runtime = 28 minutes = k*40*(s)^2/2
Ratio is 7/28 = k*10*(s)^2/2/k*40*(s)^2/2 = 0.25 a linear scaling in number of words which substantiates the theoretical bound. If cluster scales on number of words and documents (e.g logd and logn) this should have non-linear asymptotic scaling. Maximum number of words per document can be an assumption and set to a harcoded large number. If number of web documents versus number of keywords follow a Gaussian Normal distribution i.e a small fraction of documents have high number of words while the tails have less number of keywords, cluster prescales on a function of mean which is apriori known by a heuristic. Above excludes the crawling time per webpage - crawling does not build linkgraph.

internally relies on [BerkmanSchieberVishkin] and other All Nearest Smaller Values PRAM algorithms for merging sorted tesselated hyperbolic arc segments which is then binary searched to find a factor. There are some older alternatives to merging sorted lists other than All Nearest Smaller Values which require more processors. Section 2.4 in [RichardKarp-VijayaRamachandran] on "Sorting, Merging and Selection" in PRAM where input is an array of O(N=n) elements, describes some standard PRAM algorithms, gist of which is mentioned below (https://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/1988/5865.html):

	259.1) There are 3 parallel computing models - Parallel Comparisons, Comparator Sorting Networks and PRAMs
	259.2) Section 2.4.1 on merging two increasing sequences of length n and m, n <= m in Page 19 gives an algorithm of O(loglogN) steps on O(n+m) CREW PRAM processors. This constructs a merge tree bottom-up to merge two sorted lists. For merging more than 2 lists, requires logarithmic additional parallel steps.
	259.3) Section 2.4.2 describes Batcher's and [AjtaiKomlosSzmeredi] Bitonic Sort algorithm which sorts n elements in O((logn)^2) time with n/2 processors.
	259.4) Section 2.4.3 describes Cole's PRAM sorting algorithm which requires O(logn) steps and O(n) PRAM processors.

Advantage of these older algorithms is they are implementable e.g Bitonic sort - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitonic_sorter, http://www.nist.gov/dads/HTML/bitonicSort.html. Replacing [BerkmanSchieberVishkin] in ANSV sorted tile merge for discrete hyperbolic factorization with older algorithms like bitonic parallel sorting networks would require more processors but still be in NC though not PRAM.

- Bitonic Sort is O((logn)^2) and theoretically in NC
- Bitonic Sort requires O(n^2logn) parallel comparators. Presently this parallelism is limited to parallel
exchange of variables in bitonic sequence for which python has builtin support (bitonic_compare()) - internally how it performs on
multicore archs is not known.
- a shell script has been added which does the following (cpp-src/miscellaneous/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_Bitonic.sh):
        - NC Factorization implementation with Bitonic Sort is C+++Python (C++ and Python)
        - C++ side creates an unsorted mergedtiles array for complete tesselated hyperbolic arc
(cpp-src/miscellaneous/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_Bitonic.cpp)
        - This mergedtiles is captured via output redirection and awk in a text file
cpp-src/miscellaneous/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_Bitonic.mergedtiles
        - Python bitonic sort implementation which is a modified version of algorithm in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitonic_sorter
requires the size of the array to be sorted in exponents of 2. Presently it is hardcoded as array of size 16384 - 2^16
(python-src/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_Bitonic.py). It outputs the sorted array. Vacant elements in array are zero-filled

- Binary and logs for C++ and Python side have been committed
- Parallel comparators on large scale require huge cloud of machines per above bound which makes it NC.

- Compare step in Bitonic Sort for merged tiles has been Spark MapReduced with this separate script - ../python-src/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_Bitonic_Spark.py. Can be used only in a large cluster.  With this comparators are highly parallelizable over a cloud and thus in NC.

  Interim Commits for ongoing investigation of a race condition in Spark MapReduce for NC Factorization with Bitonic Sort :
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The sequential version of bitonic sort has been updated to do away with usage of boolean flag up by 2 compare functions for True and False
- Spark NC implementation of Bitonic Sort for Factorization still has some strange behaviour in sorting. In progress commits for this do
following in Compare-And-Exchange phase:
        - Comparator code has been rewritten to just do comparison of parallelized RDD set of tuples where each tuple is of the form:
                (i, i+midpoint)
        - This comparison returns a set of boolean flags collect()ed in compare()
        - The variable exchange is done sequentially at each local node.
        - This is because Spark documentation advises against changing global state in worker nodes (though there are exceptions in accumulator)
        - There were some unusual JVM out of memory crashes, logs for which have been committed
        - some trivial null checks in complement.py
        - Bitonic Sort presents one of the most non-trivial cases for parallelism - parallel variable compare-and-exchange to be specific
and present commits are a result of few weeks of tweaks and trial-errors.
        - Still the race condition is observed in merge which would require further commits.

Interim commits 2 for ongoing investigation of race conditions in Spark Bitonic Sort:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        - bidict usage has been removed because it requires bidirectional uniqueness, there are better alternatives
        - The variable exchange code has been rewritten in a less complicated way and just mimicks what sequential version does
in CompareAndExchange phase.
        - logs for Sequential version has been committed
        - number to factor has been set to an example low value
        - .coordinates and .mergedtiles files have been regenerated
        - Still the race condition remains despite being behaviourally similar to sequential version except the parallel comparator array returned by mapreduce
        - Parallel comparator preserves immutability in local worker nodes

265. (THEORY) UGC(Unique Games Conjecture) and Special Case of Percolation-Majority Voting Circuits
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
265.1 Unique Games Conjecture by [SubhashKhot] is a conjecture about hardness of approximating certain constraint satisfaction problems. It states that complexity of obtaining polynomial time approximation schemes for specific class of constraint satisfaction NP-hard problems is NP-hard itself i.e polytime approximation is NP-hard. From section 255 above, if in a special case percolation with sampling of left-right points on percolation grids results in logarithmic advice, then percolation is in NC/log. Thus if RHS has 100% stable NP-hard voting function then NP is in NC/log implying NP is in P/log and P=NP. This disproves UGC trivially because all NP problems have P algorithms. But this disproof depends on strong assumptions that percolation has NC/log circuit and RHS of Majority voting is 100% noise stable. There are already counterexamples showing divergence of RHS in sections 53.16.3.1 and 256.
265.2 Voter Boolean Functions can be written as :
	265.2.1 Integer Linear Programs : Voter Judging Boolean Functions are translated into an Integer Linear Program, binary to be precise because value for variable and final vote is 0, 1 and -1(abstention). This readily makes any decision process by individual voter to be NP-hard.
	265.2.2 and Constraint Satisfaction Problems : Voter expects significant percentage of constraints involving variables to be satisfied while voting for a candidate which brings the majority voting problem into the UGC regime. Approximating the result of an Election mentioned in Section 14 is thus reducible to hardness of approximation of constraint satisfaction and could be NP-hard if UGC is true.
265.3 Thus RHS of Majority Voting Circuit becomes a functional composition behemoth of indefinite number of individual voter constraint and integer linear programs. There is a generic concept of sensitivity of a non-boolean function mentioned in [Williamson-Schmoys] which can be applied to sensitivity and stability of a voter integer linear program and constraint program.
265.4 Approximating outcome of a majority voting (e.g. real life pre/post poll surveys) depends thus on following factors:
	265.4.1 Correctness - Ratio preserving sample - How reflective the sample is to real voting pattern e.g a 60%-40% vote division in reality should be reflected by the sample.
	265.4.2 Hardness - Approximation of Constraint Satisfaction Problems and UGC.

- AsFer Design Document updated for already implemented NVIDIA CUDA Parallel C reference code for bitonic sort on hypercube
- Bitonic Sort C++ code updated for max size of sort array - reduced from 16384 to 256
- Bitonic Sort Python Spark implementation updated for returning a tuple containing index info also instead of plain boolean value 
because Spark collect() after a comparator map() does not preserve order and index information was lost.
- if clauses in exchange phase have been appropriately changed
- Still there are random mysterious jumbled tuples which will be looked into in future commits
- This implementation becomes redundant because of already existing better NVIDIA CUDA Parallel C implementation and 
is of academic interest only.

Accumulator support for Bitonic Sort mapreduce globalmergedtiles
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Spark context has been parametrized and is passed around in the recursion so that single spark context keeps track of the
accumulator variables
- globalmergedtiles_accum is the new accumulator variable which is created in driver and used for storing distributed mutable globalmergedtiles
- AccumulatorParam has been overridden for Vectors as globals
- Spark does not permit however, at present, mutable global state within worker tasks and only driver creates the accumulator variables which can only be incrementally extended within closure workers.
- muting or accessing accumulator.value within worker raises Exception: Can't access value of accumulator in worker tasks
- Logs for above have been committed to testlogs/
- Because of above limitation of Spark in global mutability, accumulator globalmergedtiles is updated only outside the Spark mapreduce closures.
- Support for global mutables, if Spark has it, would make compare-and-exchange phase closer in behaviour to an NVIDIA Parallel bitonic sort.
- Documentation on this necessary feature is scarce and some suggest use of datastores like Tachyon/Alluxio for distributed shared mutables
which is non-trivial. This cloud parallel sort implementation achieves thus almost ~90% of NVIDIA CUDA parallel bitonic sort -
CompareAndExchange is done in parallel but assigning CompareAndExchange results is done sequentially.

270. Commits as on 3 May 2016
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New threading function assign_compareexchange_multithreaded() has been implemented which is
invoked in lieu of sequential for loop assignment , by creating a thread for each pair of (i,i+midpoint) compare-exchange assignment
of accumulator globalmergedtiles.This thread function assigns the Spark Mapreduce result of Compare and Exchange.

Mulithreading is an alternative for global state mutability in the absence of Spark support
and it does not require any third party in-memory cacheing products.

Coordinates are also shuffled first few elements of which correspond to number to factor N - these are
the factors found finally. Multithreaded assignment maps to a multicore parallelism. Logs for this have been
committed to testlogs with and without Coordinates Shuffling.

272. (THEORY) Integer Partitions, Riemann Sums, Multipartisan Majority Voting - a special case
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/Krishna_iResearch_DoxygenDocs/blob/master/kuja27_website_mirrored/site/kuja27/IntegerPartitionAndHashFunctions_2014.pdf, Integer Partitions when visualized as area under a curve in discrete sense, correspond to Riemann Sums Discrete Area Integral i.e Each part in the partition slices the area under a curve formed by topmost points of each part in partition. This curve can be perturbed to arbitrary shape without altering the area underneath it - in other words each perturbed curve corresponds to a partition of N where N is the area integral value for the curve. A striking analogy: a vessel containing water is perturbed and the surface of the liquid takes arbitrary curvature shapes but the volume of the liquid remains unchanged (assuming there is no spillover) - has some similarities to perturbation of spacetime Riemannian Manifolds due to gravity in General Relativity. This analogy simulates a 3-dimensional partition number (as against the usual 2-dimensional) of liquid of volume V. Let p3(V) denote the 3-dimensional partition of a liquid of volume V. It makes sense to ask what is the bound for p3(V). For example a snapshot of the curvature of liquid surface be the function f. A slight perturbation changes this function to f' preserving the volume. Hence f and f' are 2 different 3-dimensional partitions of liquid - the difference is these are continuous partitions and not the usual discrete integer partitions with distinct parts. Number of such perturbations are infinite - there are infinitely many perturbations possible creating an equivalence class: f=f'=f''=f'''=f''''=f''''' .... = V and hence p3(V) is infinite (proof is by diagonalization: an arbitrary point of the curve on the continuum can be changed and this recursively continues indefinitely). As any perturbation can be linked to a (pseudo)random source, p3(V) is equivalent to number of pseudorandom permutations (randomness extracted from some entropy source). p3(V) can be extended to arbitrary dimensions n as pn(V). This extends hash functions and also majority voting to continuous 3-dimensional setting - though it is to be defined what it implies by voting in continuous population vis-a-vis discrete - conjecturally majority voting over continuum could be undecidable (e.g every point over a real interval is a voter and 2^(Aleph-0)=Aleph-1 or cardinality of reals=cardinality of uncountable ordinals by Continuum Hypothesis and ZFAOC). In essence, Multipartisan Majority Voting = Hash Functions = Partitions in both discrete and continuous scenarios.

Sequence Mining in Prime binary strings has been made sophisticated:
        - Prints each binary string sequence pattern in decimals upto maximum of 15-bit sequences mined from first 10000 primes.
        - This decimals are written to a file PatternInFirst10000Primes.txt
        - Approx.py R+rpy2 has been invoked to print an R function plotter of this decimal pattern in prime binary string sequences
        - The function plots the sequences in Y-axis and length of sequences in asscending orider in X-axis(with decreasing support)
        - As can be seen from pdf plot, the sequences show dips amongst peaks periodically.

275. (THEORY) Non-boolean Social Choice Functions Satisfiability, Sensitivity, Stability and Multipartisan Majority Voting - 256 continued
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let f be a voter decision function which takes in x1,x2,...xm as decision variables and outputs a vote for candidate 1 <= c <= n. This
generalizes voter boolean judging functions for 2 candidates to arbitrarily large number of contestants. Assuming f to be continuous
function and parameters to be continuous (as opposed to discrete binary string SAT assignments to variables in boolean setting), this
generalizes Satisfiability problem to continuous, multivalued and non-boolean functions. This allows the candidate index to be
continuous too. The function plot of this (candidate index versus decision string) would resemble any continuous mathematical function.
Stability which is: Pr[f(s) == f(t)] - Pr[f(s) != f(t)] for randomly correlated s=(x11,x12,...,x1m) and t=(x21,x22,x23,...,x2m) where
correlation (measured by usual euclidean distance between s and t) could be uncomputable value in terms of mean but can be approximated
as difference in ratio of length integral of function arc segments with high curvature and low curvature (where function has huge fluctuations
and relatively flat).  Sensitivity follows accordingly. This requires first derivative of the function to find out local maxima and minima.
From Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem any social choice function for more than 3 candidates has a non-zero probability of being manipulated though
negligible in practice. Probably this implies atleast indirectly that the stability of any non-boolean social choice function < 1 if number of
candidates > 3 hinting at divergence of Pr(Good) Binomial series. This function plot should not be confused with function plot mentioned in
272 for votes partitioned across candidates which reduces to Riemann Sum. Unlike boolean sensitivity/stability, non-boolean counterparts
can only be approximated and exact computation might never halt being undecidable. Non-boolean Social Choice Function generalizes
satisfiability because an appropriate assignment to (x1,x2,x3,.....,xm) has to be found so that f(x1,x2,x3,.....,xm)=c where 1 <= c <= n.
This is precisely curve-line intersection problem - curve f(x1,x2,x3,...,xn) and line y=c - in computational geometry. Intersecting points
(a1,a2,a3,...,az) are the satisfying assignments which choose candidate c. Contrasting this with boolean kSAT which is NP-complete,
non-boolean kSAT has polynomial time computational geometric algorithms to find satisfying intersection points. It is intriguing to observe
a sharp threshold phenomenon in computational hardness of satisfiability - an easy polytime non-boolean kSAT becomes NP-hard boolean kSAT.
Assuming that real-life voters have non-boolean decision functions only, the RHS circuit of Pr(Good) majority voting is confined to polytime
satisfiability realm alone. Non-boolean voting decision functions can be specialized for 2 candidates special case too - this allows fractional
values to decision variables. This is plausible because Linear Programming (non-boolean) is polytime while 0-1 Integer Linear Programming
(boolean) is NP-complete. Because of Non-boolean Social Choice functions (e.g Linear Programs with Constraints which each voter solves) being the most generic which allow fractional values to variables, any of the standard polytime Simplex algorithms - Dantzig Pivot Tableau and Karmarkar Interior Point Method - can be applied to find a satisfying assignment. Voter decides to vote for/againt when the solution to LP is above/below a threshold. This is a far from real,hypothetical,perfectly rational election setting. Real life elections have bounded rationality. It is an alternative to Computational Geometric intersection detection previously mentioned.

{
When an observation stimulus from environment arrives:
	(*) Sensory instruments that simulate eye, ear, nose, etc., receive stimuli from environment (thoughts, music, noise, sound etc.,)
and convert to sentential form - this is of the order of billions - and appended to list in ThoughtNet_Edges.txt
	(*) Sentences are classified into categories (for example, by maximum core numbers in definition wordnet subgraph) which is also order of billions and added as hypergraph edges in dict with in ThoughtNet_Hypergraph.txt - hyperedge because same document can be in more than 2 classes. This creates a list for each key in dict and the list has to be sorted based on evocation potential - reward for reinforcement learning. There is no need for monte carlo and dynamic programming if pre-sorted because sum of rewards is always maximum - only topmost evocative edge is chosen in each list of a key.
	(*) observation is split to atomic units - tokenized - or classified and each unit is lookedup in ThoughtNet_Hypergraph.txt to get a list and hyperedge with maximum potential is returned as evocative with optional lambda evaluation which is the action side of reinforcement learning.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reinforcement Learning code has been bifurcated into two files than having in if-else clause, for facilitating future imports :-
one for MonteCarlo and the other for ThoughtNet Evocation.  Logs for these two have been committed to testlogs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
291. (THEORY) Logical Time and ThoughNet (related to EventNet 70-79)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ThoughtNet Hypergraph is multiplanar and when seen from elevation it resembles billions of skyscraper category towers interconnected by Thought
HyperEdges which are classified onto these categories. This gives an alternative route to define Time. Each tower represents chronologically stacked up events/occurrences/thoughts when unsorted i.e most recent thought is on top always and evocation based on chronology returns topmost thought. ThoughtNet evocation is an associative memory process returning most relevant thought in past for an observation in present. Two stack node towers with differing depths define two views of time i.e time is subjective to the category than objective across ThoughtNet. In a timeless universe, measuring duration between two events reduces to height of these unequal stacks which is not absolute - there are many logical "Time"(s). Each stack node has its own independent logical "Clock". This makes no assumption about relativistic theory of time and is independent of any physical law. From theory of computation standpoint, this is similar to a multi-tape turing machine but with added feature in which tapes are interconnected. When the stacks are sorted for evocation potential based on some criterion (e.g sentiwordnet, EEG electric pulse etc.,) chronology information is lost to some extent but still the edge id retains it - most recent edge has largest edge numeric id. Yet, this assumes a distributed global unique id is achievable. When events occur in parallel, two edges geographically separate can have same edge id in the absence of special mechanisms for uniqueness. Vis-a-vis EventNet, ThoughtNet is not a causation graph. Relationship between EventNet and ThoughtNet is: Every partaker node in EventNet has a ThoughtNet. EventNet when topologically sorted has no absolute time - can have many orderings of events - similar to ThoughtNet - each thought edge can have varied logical timestamps when viewed from different category spectacles - in the absence of time. Following is the hierarchy: Each node in an EventNet is an event, and each event has partaker nodes which create graph by interaction among themselves, and each partaker node has an internal ThoughtNet. Thus there are 3 levels - EventNet is the biggest, Event is bigger and Partaker is big - EventNet is a graph of graph nodes of graph nodes. The tensor product of these nested graphs has 3 tiers - EventNet(Event(PartakerThoughtNet))) - denoted as EventNet (*) Event (*) PartakerThoughtNet. This tensor product captures both individual's view of event ordering and cosmic event ordering. ThoughtNet per node in an event is more of a projection of its observable universe - imaginary - while interaction among nodes in an event and causality between events are real. Measurement of duration between events in this tensor product can be done in various ways: 1) Distance between two event nodes causally connected 2) Global topological sorting of EventNet 3) From the ThoughtNet projection observed by each node in an event. This gives rise to multiple interpretations of time.

As a working example, following edges were evoked when word "economic" was uttered:
===========================================================================================
Observation: economic
evocative thought (reward) returned(in descending order of evocation potential): The HDI was created to emphasize that people and their capabilities should be the ultimate criteria for assessing the development of a country, not economic growth alone. The HDI can also be used to question national policy choices, asking how two countries with the same level of GNI per capita can end up with different human development outcomes. These contrasts can stimulate debate about government policy priorities.
evocative thought (reward) returned(in descending order of evocation potential): We need an SPI and we need to understand its value in our society because we need to understand how we’re doing in terms of health and education and the quality of our water
evocative thought (reward) returned(in descending order of evocation potential): Social progress depends on the policy choices, investments, and implementation capabilities of multiple stakeholders—government, civil society, and business.
===========================================================================================
Only the top most evocative edge (sorted based on sentiment scores) has the word "economics" in it while the other two don't. But still the classification by definition graph core numbers inferred that these belong to "economic" class and pigeonholed them to stack "economic" - in other words the concept "economics" was deep-learnt by inner graph structure of the sentence without training data. But bottom two edges were most recent compared to the topmost and yet scored less on sentiment.

A practical ThoughtNet storage could be of billions of edges based on experiential learning of an individual over a period of lifetime and has to be suitably stored in a medium that mimicks brain.  Ideally ThoughtNet has to be in some persistence bigdata storage though it still is just an approximation. Neo4j backend for ThoughtNet has been implemented in ThoughtNet/. ThoughtNet is kind of Evocation WordNet expanded for thoughts represented as sentences (because there is no better way to encode thoughts than in a natural language) and classified. Hypergraph encodes the edges as numbers - for example, "transactions":[1] and "security":[1] implies that a sentence numbered 1 has been pre-classified under transactions and security categories.  Also "services":[0,1] implies that there are two sentences encoded as 0 and 1 classified in services category with descending order of evocative potentials - 0 is more evocative than 1.  In an advanced setting the ThoughtNet stores the lambda function composition parenthesized equivalent to the sentence and action taken upon evocation is to evaluate the most potent evocative lambda expression.  On an evocative thought, state of "ThoughtNet" mind changes with corresponding action associated with that state (the usual mind-word-action triad). Philosophically, this simulates the following thought experiment:
	- Word: Sensory receptors perceive stimuli - events
	- Mind: stimuli evoke thoughts in past
	- Action: Evocative thought is processed by intellect and inspires action - action is a lambda evaluation of a sentence.

	 ^				                          ^
	 |<------------------------------------------------------>|

and above is an infinite cycle. Previous schematic maps interestingly to Reinforcement Learning(Agent-Environment-Action-Reward).
##############################################################################
In this aspect, ThoughtNet is a qualitative experimental inference model compared to quantitative Neural Networks.

It is assumed in present implementation that every thought edge is a state implicitly, and the action
for the state is the "meaning" inferred by recursive lambda evaluation (lambda composition tree evaluation for a natural
language sentence is not implemented separately because its reverse is already done through closure of a RGO graph in other
code in NeuronRain AsFer. Approximately every edge in Recursive Gloss Overlap wordnet subgraph is a lambda function with its
two vertices as operands which gives a more generic lambda graph composition of a text)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
292. (THEORY) Recursive Lambda Function Growth Algorithm and Recursive Gloss Overlap Graph - 216 Continued
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lambda Function Recursive Growth algorithm for inferring meaning of natual language text approximately, mentioned in 216 relies
on creation of lambda function composition tree top-down by parsing the connectives and keywords of the text. Alternative to this top-down
parsing is to construct the lambda function composition graph instead from the Recursive Gloss Overlap WordNet subgraph itself where
each edge is a lambda function with two vertex endpoints as operands (mentioned in 291). Depth First Traversal of this graph iteratively
evaluates a lambda function f1 of an edge, f1 is applied to next edge vertices in traversal to return f2(f1), and so on upto function
fn(fn-1(fn-2(.....(f2(f1))...) which completes the recursive composition. Which one is better - tree or graph lambda function growth - depends
on the depth of learning necessary. Rationale in both is that the "meaning" is accumulated left-right and top-down on reading a text.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
293.(FEATURE-DONE) Commits - 7 July 2016 - Experimental implementation of Recursive Lambda Function Growth Algorithm (216 and 292)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Each Sentence Text is converted to an AVL Balanced Tree (inorder traversal of this tree creates the original text)
2.Postorder traversal of this tree computes a postfix expression
3.Postfix expression is evaluated and a lambda function composition is generated by parenthesization denoting a function with two arguments.Logs
for this have been committed to testlogs/ which show the inorder and postorder traversal and the final lambda function grown from a text.
4.This is different from Part of Speech tree or a Context Free Grammar parse tree.
5.On an average every english sentence has a connective on every third word which is exactly what inorder traversal of AVL binary tree does.If not a general B+-Tree can be an ideal choice to translate a sentence to tree. Every subtree root in AVL tree is a lambda function with leaves as operands.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
294. (FEATURE-DONE) Commits - 8 July 2016

Changed Postfix Evaluation to Infix evaluation in Lambda Function Growth with logs in testlogs/

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
295. (THEORY) Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits, Reinforcement Learning and ThoughtNet - related to 241, 291, 292 - 18 July 2016
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits are the class of problems where a choice has to be made amongst k arms and each iteration fetches a reward. Choice of an arm in next iteration depends on rewards for previous iteration. Ideal examples are Recommender Systems, Contextual website advertisements etc., Thus an agent learns from past and policy action depends on rewards for previous actions. Translating this into ThoughtNet realm is fairly straightforward - Each class stack node in ThoughtNet is a multi-armed bandit and an evocative has to choose a hyperedge that 1) maximizes reward by fitting the context meaningfully and 2) learns from rewards for previous actions by virtue of ThoughtNet storage itself because ThoughtNet per partaker is built gradually by storing thought hyperedges colored with a sentiment mentioned in Ramsey coloring of ThoughtNet in 236 (or SentiWordNet score). In terms of a Markov Model, Reward for an evocative word w at time t is denoted as Reward(w,t) and returns a corresponding thought hyperedge which depends on Reward(w, t-1), Reward(w, t-2) and so on i.e Reward(w,t) = function_of(Reward(w,t-1), Reward(w,t-2), ..., Reward(w,0)). Recommender Systems in e-commerce websites which display similar items to a selected item in shopping cart have a striking resemblance to ThoughtNet evocation. This makes ThoughtNet a suitable candidate for Recommender System - Sales history is built as a ThoughtNet similar to the algorithm mentioned in 283 and 288. Every item added to shopping cart returns evocatives based on some scoring (sentiment ranked etc.,) which is a Recommender System.

296. (FEATURE-DONE) Music Pattern Mining - Jensen-Shannon Divergence Distance between two FFT Frequency Distributions for similarity
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Commits - 20 July 2016 - related to 68, 69
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(NOTE: Because of some weird SourceForge/GitHub error, FFT txt files added to repos on 19 July 2016 are still flagged as new(?). They have been
added to repos again along with new files)

FFTs of 2 audio files are parsed and written to *_trimmed.txt by awk to contain only the frequencies for each sample.
These files are read by JensenShannonDivergence.py to compute the JS Distance between these two FFT frequency distributions.
Preprocessing is done so as to normalize the frequency to map to a probability (frequency/sum_of_frequencies) which gives
probability distribution from frequency distribution. Jensen-Shannon Distance which is the weighted average of bidirectional
Kullback-Leibler Divergence measures of the two distributions, indicates similarity or distance between two music samples
quantitatively.

There are 4 music samples: music_pattern_mining/FFT_classical_1_20July2016.txt and music_pattern_mining/FFT_classical_2_20July2016.txt
are similar (similar notes sung by different musicians). music_pattern_mining/FFT_classical_1_19July2016.txt and
music_pattern_mining/FFT_classical_2_19July2016.txt are also similar (different set of notes sung by different musicians). Jensen-Shannon
distance across these 4 ordered pairs is captured and committed in testlogs/

Jensen-Shannon Distance across 2 FFT Frquency-Probability distributions of music samples is a simple, basic measure for distance and can be
basis for clustering and classification of music. There could be some inaccuracies because Audacity does not generate FFT for complete
music file but only for first ~5 minutes. Two similar notes with different musicians could be distant and two dissimilar notes might be
close because of this Audacity limitation. Presently noise filtering and cherrypick peak frequencies is not done and 
entire frequency range is compared.

297. (FEATURE-DONE) Software Analytics - Cyclomatic Complexity from SATURN .dot graphs - related to 65
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Commits - 22 July 2016
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New Python-Spark implementation that reads the SATURN program analyzer generated .dot graph files processes them with Spark
MapReduce to find the number of edges and vertices in the graph represented by .dot file for each snippet. From this
Cyclomatic Complexity is calculated (which is Edges - Vertices + 2) -  a standard Function Point Estimator for code complexity.
There were some JVM crashes frequently while starting up spark-submit logs for which are also committed in testlogs along with
the two successful Spark computed Cyclomatic Complexity measures for two .dot files. These .dot files are sourced from
VIRGO Linux saturn program analysis kernel driver.

298. (FEATURE-DONE) String Search - Longest Common Substring - Suffix Trees(Suffix Arrays+LCP) Implementation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Commits - 26 July 2016
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This implementation finds the most repeated substrings within a larger string by constructing Suffix Trees
indirectly with Suffix Array and Longest Common Prefix (LCP) datastructures. An ideal application for String Search is
in Bioinformatics, Streamed Data analysis etc., For example, a Time Series data with fluctuating curve can be 
encoded as a huge binary string by mapping ebb and tide to 0 and 1. Thus a function graph time series is projected on to
{0,1} alphabet to create blob. Usual Time Series analysis mines for Trends, Cycles, Seasons and Irregularities over time.
This binary encoding of time series gives an alternative spectacle to look at the trends (highs and lows). Longest repeating
pattern in this binary encoding is a cycle. Suffix Array by [UdiManber] has been implemented over Suffix Trees implementations
of [Weiner] and [Ukkonen] because of simplicity of Suffix Arrays and Suffix Trees=Suffix Arrays + LCPs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
299. (FEATURE-DONE) Binary String Encoding of Time Series - Commits - 27 July 2016
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. New python script to encode a time series datastream as binary string has been added to repository.
2. This writes to StringSearch_Pattern.txt which is read by StringSearch_LongestRepeatedSubstring.py
3. Encoding scheme: If next data point is smaller, write 0 else if greater write 1. This captures the
fluctuations in dataset irrespective of the amplitudes at each point.
4. For example a bitonic sequence would have been encoded as ....111111110000000.... (ascends and descends)
5. Suffix Array + LCP algorithm on this sequence finds the Longest Repeated Substring. For a specific example of
Stock ticker time series data this amounts to frequently recurring fluctuation pattern.
6. Logs for the above have been committed to testlogs/
7. Every time series dataset is a union of bitonic sequences with varying lengths corresponding to peaks and troughs
and has self-similar fractal structure (zooming out the series has similarities to original series) . This implies the 
binary string encoded as previously is fractal too.

root user by cookie setting. Entry point has been changed to http://host:33333/neuronrain_auth (Login).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
301. (FEATURE-DONE) OAuth2 authentication and credentials storage in MongoDB/Redis with passlib sha256 encryption
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Login Handler has been augmented with OAuth2 authentication by python-oauth2 library.
2.MongoDB is used as OAuth2 credentials storage backend and Redis for token storage backend
3.Passlib is used to encrypt the password with SHA256 hash digest and stored once in MongoDB (code is commented)
4.Login page password is verified with passlib generated hash in MongoDB queried for a username argument
5.With this minimal standard authentication has been implemented for NeuronRain cloud deployment.
6.Prerequisite is to populate MongoDB neuronrain_oauth database and neuronrain_users collections with
passlib encypted JSON by uncommenting the collections.insert_one() code.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
303. (THEORY) Update on Bitonic Sort Merge Tree for Discrete Hyperbolic Factorization Spark Cloud Implementation in 34.20
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bitonic Sort Merge Tree for Discrete Hyperbolic Factorization described in http://sourceforge.net/projects/acadpdrafts/files/DiscreteHyperbolicPolylogarithmicSieveForIntegerFactorization_PRAM_TileMergeAndSearch_And_Stirling_Upperbound_updateddraft.pdf/download has following bound which can be derived as:

303.1 Bitonic Sort requires O((logN)^2) time with O(N*(logN)^2) processors.
303.2 Discretized Hyperbolic arc of length N can be split into N/logN segments of length logN each.
303.3 Above N/logN segments can be grouped in leaf level of merge tree into N/2logN pairs of (logN,logN) = 2logN length segments to be sorted together.
303.4 Each such pair can be sorted in log(2logN) time in parallel with N/(2logN) * N(logN)^2 = N^2/2logN comparator processors in leaf level which is the maximum number of processors required. Next level requires log(4logN), log(8logN) and so on till root.
303.5 Height of the merge tree is O(log(N/logN)). Total sort time is sum over sorts at each level of merge tree = log(2logN) + log(4logN) + ... + log((2^log(N/logN))*logN)
303.6 Total sort time of merge tree is upperbounded as (not tight one) height * maximum_sort_time_per_level:
	<= O(log(N/logN) * log(N/logN*logN)) = O(log(N/logN) * log(N))
      with maximum of N^2/2logN processor comparators at leaf which tapers down up the tree.
303.7 Binary Search on final sorted merged tile requires additional O(logN) which effectively reduces to:
	O(log(N/logN)*logN + logN) = O(log(N/logN)*logN) <= O((logN)^2) time
      with N^2/2logN processor comparators for finding a factor.
303.8 This is comparably better bound than the Parallel RAM ANSV algorithm based merge sort alternatives and easy to implement on a cloud as done in 34.20 and also is in NC because of polylog time and polynomial comparator processors required.
303.9 Again the input size is N and not logN, but yet definition of NC is abided by. It remains an open question whether Bitonic Sort Comparators are equivalent conceptually to PRAMs (Are cloud nodes same as PRAMs assuming the nodes have access to a shared memory?).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(BUG - STABILITY ISSUES) Commits - 1 August 2016 - VIRGO Linux Stability Issues - Ongoing Random oops and panics investigation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. GFP_KERNEL has been replaced with GFP_ATOMIC flags in kmem allocations.
2. NULL checks have been introduced in lot of places involving strcpy, strcat, strcmp etc., to circumvent
buffer overflows.
3. Though this has stabilized the driver to some extent, still there are OOPS in unrelated places deep
with in kernel where paging datastructures are accessed - kmalloc somehow corrupts paging
4. OOPS are debugged via gdb as:
        4.1 gdb ./vmlinux /proc/kcore
        or
        4.2 gdb <loadable_kernel_module>.o
   followed by
        4.3 l *(address+offset in OOPS dump)
5. kern.log(s) for the above have been committed in tar.gz format and have numerous OOPS occurred during repetitive telnet and syscall
invocation(boost::python C++) invocations of virgo memory system calls.
6. Paging related OOPS look like an offshoot of set_fs() encompassing the filp_open VFS calls.
7. In C++ Boost::Python extensions, flag changed for VIRGO memory system calls invocation from python.

307. (THEORY) Sentiment Analysis from Recursive Gloss Overlap as a Voting Function in Majority Voting - related to 14
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As mentioned in 306, Sentiment Analysis scores derived from Recursive Gloss Overlap graph of a text is an indirect voting function - when the
overall sentiment is negative it is an "against" vote and when positive it is a "for" vote. In this sense, Sentiment Analysis shrouds a Satisfiability problem underneath it. In other words every polarised text is a boolean SAT circuit translated into natural language text which opens whole new vista to look at Sentiment Analysis per se. Infact it is a generalization of a boolean SAT circuit - it is bipolar and whichever polarity wins decides the vote.

308. (FEATURE-DONE) Markov Random Fields (MRF) Belief Propagation - Commits - 8 August 2016
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Existing Sentiment Analyzer does belief propagation by computing product of potentials in DFS traversal only.
New function for Markov Random Fields Belief Propagation has been included which handles the generalized case of belief propagation in a
graph by factoring it into maximal cliques and finding potentials per clique. These per clique potentials are multiplied and normalized
with number of cliques to get polarized sentiments scores - positive, negative and objective. Logs for Sentiment Analysis of tweets stream
with MRF have been committed to testlogs/

309. (FEATURE-DONE) Commits - 12 August 2016 - Boost 1.58.0 upgrade from 1.55.0 - Boost::Python C++ extensions for VIRGO
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Rebuilt Boost::Python extensions for VIRGO Linux kernel system calls with boost 1.58 upgraded from boost 1.55.
2.kern.log for miscellaneous VIRGO system calls from both telnet and system call request routes has been compressed and committed to
testlogs (~300MB).
Following multiple debug options were tried out for heisencrash resolution (Note to self):
3./etc/sysctl.conf has been updated with kernel panic tunables with which the mean time between crashes has increased and crash location is
deep within kernel (VMA paging) - commits for this are in VIRGO linux tree. With these settings following usecase works:
        virgo_cloud_malloc()
        virgo_cloud_set()
        virgo_cloud_get()
        virgo_cloud_set() overwrite
        virgo_cloud_get()
through telnet route.
4.Debugging VIRGO linux kernel with an Oracle VirtualBox virtual machine installation and debugging the VM with a netconsole port via KGDB was explored, but there are serious issues with VirtualBox initialization in Qt5.
5.Debugging VIRGO linux kernel with QEMU-KVM installation and debugging the VM with a netconsole port via KGDB is being explored. Reference documentation at: https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/gdb-kernel-debugging.txt

310. (THEORY) DFT of a Sliding Window Fragment of Time Series, Integer Partitions and Hashing
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time Series Data Stream can be viewed through a sliding window of some fixed width moving across the data. Captured data points in such
window are analyzed in frequency domain with a Discrete Fourier Transform. If there are n frequencies in the window of data,there are n
sinusoids which superimpose to form the original data. In discrete sense, sinusoids partition the data at any time point. Following the
relation between hash functions and integer partitions in https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/IntegerPartitionAndHashFunctions_2014.pdf ,
each of n discrete sinusoid in DFT corresponds to a hash function and the time-series sliding window is an amalgamation of n hash functions.

311. (THEORY) Pr(Good) Majority Voting Circuit, Percolation, PRG choice and Boolean Circuit Composition  - related to 14, 53.12 and 129
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Even though Percolation circuit is in Noise Stability Regime with zero sensitivity and 100% stability, delta term mentioned in matrix
of 14 and 53 (second column) need not be zero which could force percolation circuit to be in BPNC. Problem is then derandomizing BPNC. (Open question: Is BPNC in NC/poly?). Thus LHS of Pr(Good) could be in BPNC which coincides with [Applebaum] NC1 PRG based pseudorandom choice described in - https://5d99cf42-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/kuja27/LowerBoundsForMajorityVotingPseudorandomChoice.pdf and https://5d99cf42-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/kuja27/IndepthAnalysisOfVariantOfMajorityVotingwithZFAOC_2014.pdf. Boolean Function Composition is preferred over Oracle results for Majority Voting circuit which is an NC1 circuit with CircuitSAT as inputs for each voter. This is infact "Boolean Circuit Composition" corresponding to Boolean Function Composition.

312. (THEORY) Circuit SAT lowerbounds for Pr(Good) Majority Voting - related 14 and 129
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
312.1 RHS of Pr(Good) Majority Voting circuit is an NC circuit in composition with CircuitSAT for each voter. This parallel voting by electorate
requires some kind of barrier synchronization so that input from all voters is available to NC Majority Circuit. This is a non-trivial overhead
to be ignored because the barrier delay depends on the voter whose decision time is the most. If in worst case the bottleneck voter function is
in EXP then barrier synchronization is also in EXP. It is also assumed that voters decide independent of each other.
312.2 CircuitSAT is the circuit version of CNF SAT concerned with the bounds for finding satisfying assignments to a circuit to get the output true at root of Circuit DAG.
312.3 An arbitrary Circuit's Satisfiability requires O(2^0.4058m) where m is the number of gates in Circuit(i.e. size of circuit).This bound was proved in [SergeyNurk] - ftp://ftp.pdmi.ras.ru/pub/publicat/preprint/2009/10-09.pdf.gz. This is very generic bound without concerning the complexity classes of voter decisioning function.
312.4 Because of the fact that Pr(good) majority voting is a circuit composition with voter circuit SATs as inputs to NC majority circuit, previous bound applies and estimates the time for each voter's decision to be input to Majority circuit. In other words, a satisfying assignment to atleast half of the electorate CircuitSATs has to be found to pronounce a winner. Time required to convince a voter is therefore exponential in size of the voter circuit. For a voter k size of the CircuitSAT is m(k) and the time required to satisfy it is O(2^0.4058*m(k)).
312.5 Let number of voters be n and number of gates on the average per voter be m. NC1 majority requires O(logn) time because n voters input to it at leaf.There are mn gates for all voters. Per voter decision requires O(2^0.4058m) time in parallel to find a satisfying assignment to atleast n/2 voters for majority to output 1.
312.6 If number of voters is exponential in number of gates per voter then n=2^m which is the worst case scenario and is the most realistic, then size of the Majority voting circuit in RHS of Pr(Good) is m*2^m - exponential in size of per voter circuit. LHS of Pr(Good) is NC/poly or BPNC percolation circuit while RHS is an exponential circuit (DC uniform - PH if depth restricted or EXP if depth unrestricted)
312.7 In a very generic case, as mentioned in 275, each voter can have a non-boolean voting function viz., a linear program or constraint satisfaction which is NP if integer-LP and is in P if real-LP (simplex, interior point). In terms of Oracles circuit for RHS Pr(Good) can be written as:
	312.7.1 NC^P (if voting functions are real LP) and LHS NC/poly or BPNC percolation lowerbounds NC^P when both LHS and RHS are of same error
	312.7.2 NC^NP (if voting functions are integer LP) and LHS NC/poly or BPNC percolation lowerbounds NC^NP when both LHS and RHS are of same error
312.8 Circuit Size of Pr(Good) RHS is non-trivial to determine. All that is known so far is the bound for CircuitSAT which is O(2^0.4058m) where m is number of gates. But number of gates itself is an open problem for SAT - it is not known if NP has polynomial size circuits.
312.9 Assumption 1: Each voter has different variables - set of variables of voters are all pairwise disjoint.
312.10 If number of voters is arbitrarily huge and if number of voters is exponential in number of gates per voter SAT, size of RHS is m2^m with unbounded fan-in, unrestricted depth most probably and thus in EXP, with AND-OR-NOT gates. Assumption 2: When voters have common variables it implies that they decide in unison. For example if variable x is common to voters v1 and v2, both v1 and v2 assign x=0 or x=1. This is negation of Assumption 1 in 312.9 and Assumption 1 is more realistic than Assumption 2.
312.11 Even if m (number of gates per voter SAT) is assumed to be polynomial in number of input variables i.e m=f(v) where v is average number of inputs per voter, size of RHS is f(v)*2^f(v) - exponential in number of variables. Thus in all probability RHS majority voting circuit is exponential DC-uniform circuit in PH or EXP even if NP has polynomial size circuits. This is a special case with lot of assumptions made in 312.6,312.9 and 312.10.
312.12 If both LHS and RHS of Pr(Good) are of zero or equal error, LHS lowerbounds RHS (an assumption made throughout this document - equal error with differing circuit sizes implies lowerbound). Here error is the usual (NoiseSensitivity +/- delta) on both LHS and RHS. For percolation circuit in LHS, NoiseSensitivity is zero . But for RHS NoiseSensitivity is unknown. With an assumption that RHS has non-zero error, it is a BP.EXP circuit assuming unrestricted depth of RHS. LHS is NC/poly with zero error, while RHS is BPEXP and thus implies BPEXP is in NC/poly which resembles BPP in P/poly. If LHS has an error with a PRG choice function in NC (e.g Applebaum NC PRG with linear stretch), LHS would have been a BPNC circuit implying BPEXP is in BPNC which is absurd and conflicts with assumption that equal error implies lowerbound (refer 53.9, 53.14 and 53.16) - this conflict is resolved only if LHS and RHS do not have equal error with differing circuit sizes (and also implies that error depends on circuit size?).
312.13 Important notion in representing a voter boolean function by a circuit is Hardness which is defined as:
A boolean function f:{0,1}^n->{0,1} is h-hard if there exists a circuit C of size s such that for all x in {0,1}^n, Pr(C(x)=f(x)) < h. Narrative above on CircuitSAT for voter boolean functions is incomplete without knowing how hard is it to compute or approximate the voter decision function with a circuit of size s. Harder a function, lower the value of h (0 < h < 1). This definition of hardness is far better generalization of computational complexity of a voter boolean function than identifying with complexity class names. [Yao] XOR Lemma is applied to amplify hardness of boolean function by XOR-ing values of f on many randomly distributed inputs.
312.14 There are two classes of errors: Voter error + Voting error. Voter error is the Noise Sensitivity of a voter boolean function while Voting error is the intrinsic error in voting system itself though user has done nothing wrong. E.g Malfunctioning Electronic Voting Machines. Voter error is captured by second and third column of matrix in 53.14 while Voting error is captured by probabilistic truth table of the function - inputs have no effect on this error. This implies delta in Pr(Good) series error (NoiseSensitivity +/- delta) might have to account for voting error term also, over and above voter error.

312.24 Size hierarchy of 312.22 in Pr(Good) majority voting circuit context implies that number of functions computable by LHS has to be different from number of functions computable by RHS when LHS is NC/poly and RHS is PH or EXP i.e if EXP does not have polysize circuits. The central motivation for equating LHS and RHS of Pr(Good) is both sides are 2 algorithms to decide same question: Non-majority choice and Majority choice - which is more efficient where efficiency implies less error? This motivation therefore leads to assumption stated in disclaimer earlier: less circuit size implies a lowerbound (i.e least circuit size of LHS and RHS is chosen as separating class containing the other) when errors are equal or less.
312.25 If circuit sizes differ in zero-error case on both sides i.e when 100% convergence occurs (or) equal error on both sides of series, then by size hierarchy, size(LHS) < size(RHS) implies RHS computes functions not possible by LHS and viceversa (Open question: Does this contradict lowerbound assumption? Or is this just a special case because both LHS and RHS compute same function i.e they answer same question in which case size hierarchy does not apply which counts all possible functions for specific circuit size?).
312.26 There is an alternative definition of Boolean function hardness in http://www.math.ias.edu/~avi/PUBLICATIONS/MYPAPERS/NOAM/HARDNESS/final.pdf (Section 2.2) which states hardness = circuit size complexity hardness + approximation hardness.

314. (THEORY) Pseudorandomness, Voter Decision Error and lambda-tolerant Randomized Decision Trees of Voter Boolean Functions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pseudorandom generators are those which stretch a seed l(n) to n : f:{0,1}^l(n)->{0,1}^n indistinguishable from perfect random source
with bounded error. References 314.1 and 314.2 describe a counting argument to show that there are PRGs. For a seed length d there are 2^d possible strings stretched to length n. For a single random string the probability that a circuit or an algorithm distinguishes it from perfect random source is e. By iterating over all 2^d strings generated by a PRG the expected fraction of strings distinguished is e*2^d where each iteration is a random variable with probability e and follows from union of expectations - E(sigma(Xi)) = E(X1) + E(X2) + ... + E(X(2^d)) = sigma(Xi*e). Probability that there are tails where deviation from this expected value is less than e so that indistinguishability is preserved is by Chernoff bounds: Pr(sigma(Xi)-mean > delta*mean) <= 2*exp(-delta^2*mean/3) where 0 < delta < 1 and e=delta*mean. Substituting for mean, this Probability <= 2*exp(-2^d*e*delta^2/3). For all possible algorithms or circuits of size s which could be 2^s, by union bound cumulative probability is 2^s*2*exp(-2^d*e*delta^2/3) < 1. It implies probability of distinguishability is < 1 and there should be a lurking PRG which achieves indistinguishability. This previous description is mooted to connect PRGs with Voter Decision Error. Voters have a boolean decision function in Pr(Good) majority voting circuit. Alternatively each voter decides by evaluating the leaves of the boolean decision tree of the corresponding function. Randomized decision trees allow randomness by allowing coin tosses to choose the next edge in decision tree. Reference 314.3 describes a decision tree evaluation by voter which allows error by including decision tree choices not necessarily belonging to the voter. That is, voter errs in judgement during decision process wherein (pseudo)random error pollutes his/her discretion. This formalizes the notion of Voting error (analogous somewhat to Probabilistic CNFs). The level of error probability to what decision tree deviates is upperbounded by lambda and called as lambda-tolerance. There are known results which bound the error-free decision tree complexity and erring decision tree complexity. Quoting 314.3, "...The possible algorithms can output anything. The mistake can be either way...". 1-way error occurs in one direction - 1 is output instead of 0 while 2-way error occurs in both directions - 1 for 0 and 0 for 1. This error is intrinsic to the decision process itself not just limited to sensitivity measures which depend on flipped inputs affecting outputs. Thus if error is modelled as a function of PRGs, error in voting process as a whole implies existence of PRGs. For example above distinguisher can be mapped to a voter who fails to distinguish two candidates with differing goodness - voter is fooled - a less merited candidate if had access to the intrinsic PRG that vitiates the decision tree evaluation can exploit the voter's flawed decision tree.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kernel Panic investigation for boost::python c++ invocations of Virgo System Calls
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Python code in AsFer that invokes Virgo Linux system calls by boost::python C++ bindings is being investigated further for mystery and random crashes that occur after system call code and driver end code is finished.
2.kern.log with 3 iterations of virgo_malloc()+virgo_set()+virgo_get() invocations succeeded by panics in random points at kernel has been committed.
3.Logs also contain the gdb vmlinux debugging showing line numbers within kernel source where panics occur. Prima facie look unrelated directly to virgo system calls and driver code. Debugging through KVM+QEMU is ruled out because of lack of VT-x.

317. (THEORY) Generic Definitions of Majority and Non-majority Choice Errors and some contradictions - related to 14 and 53.14
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Majority Voting Social Choice has usual meaning of aggregation of for and against votes. Non-majority Social Choice can be in two
flavours:
	317.1 Pseudorandom Choice - a Pseudorandom Generator chooses a voting function from a set of Voting functions of electorate
	317.2 Social choice by ranking - set of boolean functions are ranked ascending in their error probabilities and least error boolean function is chosen.

--------------------
Algorithm for 317.1:
--------------------
There are pseudorandom generators in NC(Applebaum PRG, Parallel PRGs etc.,) which choose a boolean function at random. This chosen boolean function can be Percolation boolean function too which is again in non-uniform NC. Thus Non-majority social choice can be done in BPNC as below:
	- Invoke a PRG in NC or P to obtain pseudorandom bits X.
	- Choose an element in electorate indexed by X.
	- Goodness of LHS is equal to the goodness of chosen element.

LHS is BPNC algorithm to RHS BPEXP Condorcet Jury Theorem (CJT) unbounded circuit and if CJT converges to 1 in RHS and Goodness of PRG choice is 1, LHS is a BPNC algorithm to EXP RHS.

--------------------
Algorithm for 317.2:
--------------------
	- foreach(voter)
	- {
	- 	Interview the voter boolean function : Rank the voters by merit (error probabilities e.g noise stability)
	- }
	- choose the topmost as non-majority social choice

LHS is a PSPACE-complete algorithm and RHS is either BPEXP or EXP algorithm depending on convergence or divergence of Goodness of CJT circuit in RHS. Goodness of LHS is the error probability of topranked boolean voter function.

Above loop can be parallelized and yet it is in PSPACE. Proof of CJT circuit in RHS to be EXP-complete would immediately yield a lowerbound and either EXP is in BPNC or EXP is in PSPACE under equal goodness assumption in LHS and RHS. EXP in PSPACE implies EXP=PSPACE because PSPACE is in EXP. An EXPTIME problem is EXP-Complete if it can solve Exponential Time Bounded Halting Problem (i.e output 1 if a Turing Machine halts after exponential number of steps). Unbounded depth RHS CJT Majority voting composition circuit (Majority+SAT) is in EXPTIME. Following reduction from Majority voting to Bounded Halting Problem is a proof outline for EXP-completeness of CJT circuit:
	(*) Let there be exponential number of voters (i.e exponential in number of variables)
	(*) Number of voters = Number of steps in Bounded Halting Problem input Turing Machine = exponential
	(*) Voting halts when all exponential voters have exercised franchise applying their SAT = EXPTIME Turing Machine Halts after exponential number of steps.

If there are n boolean functions in total and probability that a boolean function i with goodness e(i) is chosen is:
	= x(e(i))/n, where x(e(i)) is the number of boolean functions with goodness e(i)
When voter boolean functions have unequal error probabilities, the distribution is Poisson Binomial (which is for bernoulli trials with unequal probabilities for each event) and not Binomial or Poisson(which is the limit of Binomial distribution). This fraction is the LHS and in special case can be 1 when all boolean functions are of same goodness (1-error) probability. Thus LHS goodness is conditional probability x(e(i))/n * e(i) and can be 1 when all boolean functions are perfect.

Thus most generic Majority voting case is when:
	317.3 Voters have unequal decision errors
	317.4 Set of voter boolean functions is an assorted mix of varied error probabilities ranging from 0 to 1.
	317.5 Modelled by Poisson Binomial Distribution

In both Majority and Non-majority Choice, error of a boolean function comprises:
	317.6 Voting Error - Misrecorded votes, Probabilistic CNFs
	317.7 Voter Error - Noise Sensitivity of boolean function which has extraneous reasons like correlated flipped bit strings and Error intrinsic to boolean function in Decision tree evaluation (lambda-tolerant randomized decision trees) mentioned in 314.
Randomized decision tree evaluation in 317.7 adds one additional scenario to error matrix of 8 possibilities in 14 and 53.14 which is beyond just correlation error.

As mentioned elsewhere in this document and disclaimer earlier, LHS circuit is a lowerbound to RHS circuit for a C-complete class of problems when errors are equal, assuming complete problems exist for class C. When both LHS and RHS have errors, which is the most realistic case, LHS is a BPNC circuit and RHS is a BPEXP circuit with unrestricted depth of exponential sized circuit. This raises a contradiction to already known result as follows: BPP is not known to have complete problems. [Marek Karpinski and Rutger Verbeek - KV87] show that BPEXP is not in BPP and EXP is in BPEXP. If there are BPEXP-complete problems then contradiction is LHS is a BPNC algorithm to RHS BPEXP-complete problem. But BPNC is in BPP (logdepth, polysize circuit with error can be simulated in polytime with error) and BPEXP is not in BPP. This contradiction is resolved only if there are no BPEXP-complete problems or there are no BPNC/BPEXP voting functions.

From https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~greg/zoology/diagram.xml, following chain of inclusions are known:
	NC in BPNC in RNC in QNC in BQP in DQP in EXP
	RP in BPP in BQP in DQP in EXP

If LHS is a BPNC or RNC or BPP or RP pseudorandom algorithm to unbounded CJT RHS EXP-complete problem under equal goodness assumption, previous class containments imply a drastic collapse of EXP below:
	EXP=BPNC (or) EXP=RNC (or) EXP=RP (or) EXP=BPP
This is rather a serious collapse because the containments include Quantum classes BQP and QNC, implying classical parallelism is equivalent to quantum parallelism . One of the interpretations to Quantum parallelism is "Many Worlds" - computations happen in parallel (states of the wave function) and interfere construnctively or destructively (superposition of wave functions when some state amplitudes cancel out while others reinforce) to curtail some of the worlds. This special case occurs only if all voters have decision correctness probability p=1. For 1 > p > 0.5, RHS CJT circuit goodness converges to 1 for infinite electorate but LHS expected goodness of Pseudorandom social choice is always less than 1, infact tends to 0 as N is infinite as below. Referring to 359:
	Let number of voter decision functions with goodness xi = m(xi). Thus N = m(x1)+m(x2)+m(x3)+...+m(xn)
	Expected goodness of a PRG choice is:
		1/N * summation(xi*m(xi)) = (x1*m(x1) + x2*m(x2) + x3*m(x3) + ... + xn*m(xn)) / N
	When all voter functions have goodness 1 then PRG choice in LHS of P(good) has goodness 1.
For p=0.5, RHS goodness is 0.5 and LHS goodness is 0.5 => LHS is in BPNC or RNC or RP or BPP and RHS is BPEXP. If RHS is BPEXP-complete, as mentioned previously, contradicts result of [KV87], implying BPEXP=BPP. For p < 0.5, RHS CJT series goodness tends to 0 while LHS pseudorandom chouce expected goodness is always > 0. Thus only feasible lowerbound looks to be:
	EXP=BPNC (or) EXP=RNC (or) EXP=RP (or) EXP=BPP
when goodness p=1 uniformly for all infinite homogeneous electorate.

318. (THEORY) Yao's XOR Lemma, Hardness of Pr(Good) Majority Voting Function Circuit and Majority Version of XOR Lemma
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Caution: Majority Hardness Lemma derivation is still experimental with possible errors.

Hardness of a boolean function is defined as how hard computationally it is to compute the function with a circuit of size s:
	if Pr(C(x) != f(x)) = delta where C(x) computes boolean function f(x), then f(x) delta-hard.
Majority function is known to have formula of size O(n^5.3) - from Sorting networks of [AjtaiKomlosSzemeredi] and non-constructive proof by[Valiant]. Majority is computable in log-depth and hence in non-uniform NC1.

Hardness Amplification result by [AndrewYao] states that a strongly-hard boolean function can be constructed from mildly-hard boolean function by amplification of hardness using XOR of multiple instances of function on some distribution of inputs. Following derivation develops intuition for amplification in XOR lemma:
	318.1 Let f be a boolean function with delta-hardness. Therefore there is a circuit C(x) with size s,such that Pr(C(x)!=f(x))=delta. XOR lemma states that there is a circuit C1(x) with size s1, such that Pr(C1(x)!=f1(x)) tends to 0.5 > delta where f1(x) = f(x1) XOR f(x2) XOR ... XOR f(xk) for some distribution of inputs x1,x2,x3,...xk.
	318.2 Each f(xi) in XOR function f1 in 318.1, is either flipped or not flipped. Let Zi be the random variable for flip of f(xi) - Zi=0 if there is no flip and Zi=1 if there is a flip using coin toss. Now the probability of correctly computing XOR of f(xi)s is equal to the sum = Probability that none of f(xi)s are flipped + Probability that even number of f(xi) is flipped. Even flips do not alter XOR outcome while odd flips do. This is nothing but Pr[Z1 XOR Z2 XOR Z3 XOR ... Zk = 0] because even flips cause XOR of Zi=1 to zero. If (1-2*delta) is probability of no flip and 2*delta is probability of a flip, for all Zi(s) Pr(XOR is correctly computed) = (1-2*delta)^k + 0.5*(1-(1-2*delta)^k). The second term is halved because probability of even number of flips is required whereas atleast 1 flip implies both (odd+even).
	318.3 Pr(Good) majority voting boolean function computes composition of Majority function with Voting functions of individual voters. This can be expressed as: Majn(f1,f2,f3,...fn) for n voters. Till now hardness of this composition is not known in literature. Experimentally, following derivation computes hardness of this composition as below.
	318.4 For simplicity, it is assumed that all voters have same boolean function with hardness delta computable by circuit size s.
        318.5 Majority function makes error when the inputs are flipped by some correlation. This Probability that Pr(Maj(x) != Maj(y)) for two correlated strings x and y is termed as Noise Sensitivity. This together with the probability that a circuit with access to pseudorandom bits incorrectly computes majority function is an estimate of how flawed majority voting is(denoted as randomerror). Then probability that Majority function is correctly computed is 1-NoiseSensitivity(Majn) - randomerror . This implies majority function is in BPNC if there is a parallel voting.
        318.6 Noise Sensitivity of Majority function is O(1/sqrt(n*epsilon)) where epsilon is probability of flip per bit. Therefore epsilon is nothing but probability that a voter boolean function is incorrectly computed and sent as input to Majority function. This implies Pr(f(x) != C(x)) = delta = epsilon = hardness of all voter functions.
        318.7 Probability that Majority function is computed incorrectly = NoiseSensitivity +/- randomerror = [c/sqrt(n*epsilon)] +/- randomerror = [c/sqrt(n*delta) +/- randomerror ] which is the hardness of Majority+VoterFunctions composition. (Related: points 14, 53.14 and 355 for BP* error scenarios matrix which picturises overlap of Noise Sensitivity and Error)
        318.8 Above derivation,if error-free,is the most important conclusion derivable for hardness of Pr(Good) majority voting boolean function circuit composition. Hardness of RHS of Pr(Good) Majority Voting circuit is expressed in terms of hardness of individual voter boolean functions.
        318.9 Therefore from 318.7, Pr(C(Majn(f(x1),f(x2),...,f(n)) != Majn(f(x1),f(x2),...,f(n))] = [c/sqrt(n*delta) +/- randomerror] is the probability that how incorrectly a circuit of size s1 computes Majn+VoterFunction composition = hardness of majority+voter composition.
        318.10 Hardness is amplified if [c/sqrt(n*delta) +/- randomerror] >= delta as follows:

                Hardness of Maj+voter composition       [c/sqrt(n*delta)] +/- randomerror
                -----------------------------------  =  ------------------------------ 	>>  1
                Hardness of voter function                  delta

	318.11 Let randomerror=r. From above, [c/sqrt(n*delta) +/- r] / delta must be >> 1 for hardness amplification.	For large n, this limit	tends to r/delta >> 1 implying error in majority circuit has to be huge for large electorate compared to error in voter boolean function SATs for hardness amplification. Caveat: There are scenarios where numerator is comparably equal to denominator and hardness amplification may not occur. From error scenarios matrix in 355,relation between error and noise can be precisely defined as: Error = Noise + (column2 error entries) - (column3 no error entries) where randomerror = r = (column2 error entries) - (column3 no error entries) which substituted in amplification becomes:

     Hardness of Maj+voter composition       [c/sqrt(n*delta)] + [sum(column2 error entries)] - [sum(column3 no error entries)] 
    -----------------------------------  =  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------   >>  1
         Hardness of voter function                  				delta

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For large n, c/sqrt(n*delta) tends to 0 and If [sum(column2 error entries) -  sum(column3 no error entries)] >> delta then following applies: 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        318.12 318.11 implies that for weakly hard functions (low delta), if quantity in numerator (hardness of majority+voter composition) is considerably huge compared to hardness of individual voter functions, hardness is amplified .
        318.13 318.11 also implies that Majority+Voter composition is extremely hard to compute concurring with exponential circuit size (PH=DC or EXP-completeness) of Pr(Good) RHS.
	318.14 Being extremely hard implies that RHS of Pr(Good) could be one-way function. One-way functions are hard to invert defined formally as:
		Pr(f(f_inverse(y))=f(x)) is almost 0.
For example inverse for Pr(Good) majority voting function is the one that returns set of all voters who voted for a candidate to win. This implies that any electoral process has to be one-way function hard so that secret balloting is not in jeopardy and finding such inverse for majority has to be hardest. Similarity of definition of one-way function and hardness of boolean functions is obvious. Hardness for majority derived previously is for forward composition direction which itself is high.
	318.15 Conjecture: Circuit for reverse direction (i.e decomposition of majority to voters who voted in favour) is considerably harder than composition and thus Majority(n)+Voter composition is an one-way function. An intuitive proof of this conjecture: Search for all permutations of voters who voted in favour which is of size O(2^n) - equivalent to solving SAT of Majority function boolean formula to find assignments which is counting problem and is #P-Complete. Indices of 1s in the assignment strings are the voter permutations. Next step is to find satisfying assignments to individual voter SATs which is also #P-Complete. This completely inverts the Majority+Voter composition and cumulatively is atleast #P-Complete. While the forward direction is composition of NC instance to voter SATs bottom-up, inverse is harder because it is completely #P-Complete top-down.
	318.16 Huge hardness of Pr(Good) RHS also implies that very strong pseudorandom number generators can be constructed from it.
	318.17 The counting problem in 318.15 finds all possible permutations of voters who could have voted in favour while what is required is the exact permutation which caused this majority outcome. From this, probability of finding exact permutation of voting pattern = 1/#SAT = 1/number_of_sat_assignments_to_MajoritySAT. This counting and search problem is defined as function Majorityinverse(1)=(v1,v2,v3,...vn) and returns the exact permutation of voters who voted for Majority outcome to be 1.
	318.18 318.17 implies Pr(Majority(Majorityinverse(1))==Majority(v1,v2,...,vn)) = 1/#SAT <= 1/2^n in worst case.
	318.19 In average case, expected number of SAT assignments to MajoritySAT = 1*1/2^n + 2*1/2^n + ...+ 2^n*1/2^n = 2^n*(2^n+1)/2 *1/2^n = (2^n+1)/2, assuming all permutations are equally probable. Average case Pr(Majority(Majorityinverse(1))==Majority(v1,v2,...,vn)) = 1/#SAT = 2/(2^n+1) ~= 1/2^(n-1) which is same as definition of a one-way function and thus Majority is hard to invert in average case.
	318.20 318.19 implies Majority is one-way. Therefore FP != FNP and thus P != NP if hardness is amplified in 318.11.

319. (THEORY) Integer Partitions, Multiway Contests, Hash Table Functions and Ordered Bell Numbers - related to 256 and 272
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Number of hash table functions derived in https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/IntegerPartitionAndHashFunctions_2014.pdf, which sums
all possible permutations of hash buckets per partition does not consider order of elements with in each bucket. Bell number (named after
Eric Temple Bell) is the number of all possible partitions of a set (induced by all possible equivalence relations). Each hash
table is a set of equivalence classes (i.e each bucket is an equivalence class and hash function is the relation), partitioning the set.
Ordered Bell Number takes into account order of keys in each bucket and gives all possible Ordered Hash Table Functions. This is a stronger
estimate of number of hash table functions than plain counting from integer partitions which is unordered. Unordered n-th Bell Number is
given by: sigma_k=0_to_n({n,k}) where {n,k} is the Stirling Number of Second kind computing number of ways of partitioning set of size n
into subsets of size exactly k.

Let there be n keys and size of hash table be m. Let hi(x) mod m be a hash function.
For each hi
{
	For each x < n
	{
		Compute hi(x) mod m and append to corresponding chain of buckets in hash table
	}
}

Above loops create all possible partitions of set of size n. If just the integer partition is reduced to above hash table chains, sum(mP(lambda(i)) is only an approximation. Also Ordered Bell Number is an approximation as it does not permute each partition within a larger set of slots. Stirling Number of second kind {n,k} is equal to number of partitions of an n-element set into k nonempty subsets.Each partition is permuted within m slots in a separate chained hash table and each such permutation is a configuration of a hash function after all keys are populated. Total number of such functions = sum_k=1_to_m(mP({n,k}) which can be called as Augmented Stirling Number and is greater than Ordered Bell Number:
	sum_k=1_to_m(mP({n,k})) >= Ordered Bell Number = sum_k=1_to_m({n,k})

In multipartisan voting with more than 2 candidates, above augmented stirling number is also the number of all possible voting patterns with an electorate of size n voting on m candidates - each chain is the set of votes for corresponding candidate. Hash function for each voter chooses a candidate index. Thus Chained Hashing with optional sorting of chains on number of votes is Majority Function generalized. From Arrow, Friedgut-Kalai-Nisan and Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorems elections with more than 3 candidates can be manipulated implying multiway majority function has non-zero noise sensitivity.

Probability that above multiway majority function has an error (i.e chooses wrong outcome) =
Probability of changing one voting pattern to the other that changes ranking of candidates

Each voting pattern can be deemed to be a point vertex on an m-dimensional metric space and edges between these vertices are distances to other
patterns. If each edge has a probability of occurrence, Probability of flip in voting pattern due to a malpractice is the probability of a path existing between these two voting patterns in this random graph. If each each edge has equal probability, path probabilities vary between p and p^(augmented_stirling_number). This assumes that any voting error is a converging random walk on the random graph of point vertices of voting pattern in a metric space. It could be a complete graph too which does not require a random walk.

In a sense the multiway majority hashing previously is a locality sensitive hashing wherein similarity between items is defined as voters voting for same candidate who are chained together in a bucket i.e Probability(two voters x and y voting for same candidate are colocated in a bucket) = 1 and Probability(two voters x and y voting for different candidates are colocated in a bucket) = 0 with strict equalities while the distance function is defined as d(x,y) <= r if x and y vote for same candidate and d(x,y) > r else. From m-balls and n-bins problem bounds, for m >> n, maximum number of balls per bin with high probability could be m/n + theta(sqrt(mlogn/n)) - in terms of votes, this is a rough estimate of maximum votes a candidate can get with high probability in random voting. For example, a locality sensitive hash function f(x) mod m returning k for f(x) mod m with f(x) defined over [-l, +l] maps a ball of radius l comprising similar voters to a candidate k - ball is the chained bucket for k.

As mentioned in previous paragraphs, each voting pattern is a point vertex on a metric space and it is necessary to define distance d between any two voting patterns. Let v1 and v2 be two voting patterns in the chained hashing previously described for m candidates and n voters. These two patterns differ in votes per candidate. Hence it makes sense to define the distance between the patterns as number of votes gained/lost by candidates across these two patterns. Let p be the probability that single vote is transferred by rigged voting from candidate k to candidate l. Also let c1, c2, c3,..ck be the candidates who either all gained (or) all lost across voting patterns v1 and v2. Then the probability that voting pattern changes from v1 to v2 = p^d where d is the metric distance between two voting patterns defined as d = v2(c1) - v1(c1) + v2(c2) - v1(c1) + ...+ v2(ck) - v1(ck) where va(cb) is the votes for candidate cb in voting pattern va. L2 norm is not preferred because probability for voting pattern change requires gained/lost votes in one direction only. For example voting pattern {5,3,4} becoming {6,4,2} implies first 2 candidates gained 1 vote each while third candidate lost 2 votes. L2 norm is sqrt(6) while metric distance as per previous definition is 2. Greater the distance between patterns, exponentially rarer is the probability p^d of voting pattern flip. It is assumed that all voters vote independently and each vote flip in pattern change occurs independently. Thus the random graph edges between voting pattern vertices are weighted by these probabilities(p^d1, p^d2, etc., for distances d1,d2,...).This is an alternative definition of edge probability different from one described previously. Number of vertices in this random graph = augmented_stirling_number = sum_k=1_to_m(mP({n,k})) >= Ordered Bell Number

Probability of multiway majority choosing a wrong outcome = Probability that voting pattern noise flip changes sorted ranking of candidates. For example, {12,10,5} becomes {7,12,8} which changes winner from first to second candidate with total votes remaining same. Not all edges of random graph of patterns change the ranking despite noise. If majority in multiway contest is defined as candidate index getting more than half of total votes, winning voting patterns are number of integer partitions of n voters with largest part > n/2. These partitions with largest part greater than n/2 correspond to subset of voting patterns which are not affected by noise flip because only parts other than largest are shuffled. Therefore probability that outcome is not changed by noise flip of voting pattern = number_of_partitions_of_n_voters_greater_than_n/2 / partition_number(n). From this probability of wrong outcome because of noise flip in voting pattern = 1 - { (number_of_partitions_of_n_voters_greater_than_n/2) / partition_number(n) } = Noise sensitivity of Multiway Majority Function.

319.8 is an NVIDIA CUDA parallel implementation of hash table chaining. 319.9 is a recent parallel locality sensitive hashing algorithm for multicore machines, and segregates twitter stream of tweets into similar buckets. Availability of parallel algorithms for hash table chains implies that hash chaining and LSH especially could be in NC (logarithmic table construction time) though there is no known result thus far. Parallelism in multiway majority function LSH is obvious because people vote in parallel and hash chain buckets are populated in parallel across multiple voting machines in compartmentalized voting. Each such voting machine can correspond to a node in Multiway Majority circuit. The rho parameter of LSH is log(1/p1)/log(1/p2) where p1=Pr(h(x)=h(y)) if x and y had voted for same candidate and p2=Pr(h(x)=h(y)) if x and y had voted for different candidates. In multiway majority LSH mentioned previously, p1=1 and p2=0 and rho=0 where as in usual approximate neighbours problem rho is only required to be < 1. Intuitively, each hash table slot is lock-free and each bucket for a slot is lock-synchronized. Thus votes across candidates is parallelizable and votes for a candidate are serially incremented(linked-list bucket is appended). Addition of votes per candidate slot should be doable in NC (because integer addition is in NC). Thus there are as many NC circuits as there are candidates. Set of votes from all candidates has to be then sorted to find the winner which is also in NC (e.g Sorting networks). Optional comparator circuits for half-way mark comparison is also in NC. Thus Multiway majority function could be computable in Non-uniform NC which places it in same league as boolean 0-1 majority function.

A hash table chain can be viewed as a subset segment of a larger rectangular region. Complement of this subset is another hash table chain.
For example following schematic ilustrates hash table complements with respect to chained buckets:

Above diagram has two hash table chains shown in different constituent colors. Together these two cover a rectangular region. Thus left(f1) and right(f2) are complements of each other. In partition parlance, both f1 and f2 have same number of parts. Let f1 partition a set of n1 and f2 partition a set of n2 elements into chains. Let m be the number of parts in both (breadth of rectangle). Then length is (n1 + n2) / m. If Pi(f1) and Pi(f2) denote the i-th chain partition on both f1 and f2, then Pi(f1) + Pi(f2) = (n1 + n2)/m. Hash function which created f1 is known while that of f2 is unknown. This is a special case of Decidability of Complement Function mentioned in 24 where "complementation" is defined with reference to a larger universal rectangular set. From the chain pattern on right the hash function for f2 can be reverse engineered. When the left is viewed as a multiway majority voting pattern or a Locality Sensitive Hash function, right is a complementary voting pattern or a Complementary Locality Sensitive Hash Function which "inverts" the ranking. A tabulation for hash function of f2 can be constructed like an example below:
	f(x01) mod m = 0
	f(x11) mod m = 1
	f(x12) mod m = 1
	...
	f(x21) mod m = 2
	f(x22) mod m = 2
	...
where xij is the j-th element in i-th chain part in f2 on right. Above tabulation can be solved by Euclid's algorithm. For example, f(x11) mod m = 1 can be solved as:
	[-m*y + f(x11)] = 1 => f(x11) mod m = 1
Therefore above table can be written as system of congruences:
	f(x01) = a01*m + 0
	f(x11) = a11*m + 1
	f(x12) = a12*m + 1
	...
	f(x21) = a21*m + 2
	f(x22) = a22*m + 2
	...
Since m is known and all aij can take arbitrary values, complement function for f2 can be constructed by fixing aij and applying either PAC learning(approximation only) or CNF multiplexor construction/Interpolation/Fourier Series (described in 19 and 24). There are indefinite number of Complement Functions  constructible by varying aij. But Number of hash functions is upperbounded by Augmented Stirling Number. This is because hash functions which internally apply complement functions, create finite chained bucket configurations or voting patterns bounded by augmented stirling number modulo size of the table whereas complement functions don't have such restrictions in construction. This implies two complement functions could give rise to similar hash table chain configurations.  Thus set of complement functions is partitioned by hash chained configurations i.e. there are augmented stirling number of sets of complement functions. Main advantage of PAC learnt complement construction over exact multiplexed CNF construction is there are no bloating of variables and boolean conjunctions are minimal, but the disadvantage is approximation and not exact. For first n prime numbers there are log(n) conjunctions each of log(n) literals.

Boolean 0-1 majority function is a special case of multiway majority function (or) LSH, where hashtable is of size 2 with 2 chained buckets i.e.
	Augmented Stirling Number of Boolean Majority = 2P(n,1} + 2P{n,2}

Chinese Remaindering Theorem states that there is a ring isomorphism for N=n1*n2*n3*....*nk (for all coprime ni) such that:
	X mod N <=> (X mod n1, X mod n2, X mod n3, ...., X mod nk)
	(or)
	Z/NZ <=> Z/n1Z * Z/n2Z * .... * Z/nkZ
Chinese Remaindering has direct application in hash table chains as they are created in modular arithmetic. K hash functions on the right of isomorpshism correspond to K hash table chains (or) LSH (or) Voting patterns for hash tables of sizes n1,n2,....,nk. Left of isomorphism is a hash table of size N (LSH or a Voting Pattern).

From Post Correspondence Problem, if f1 and f2 in schematic diagram are two voting patterns, finding a sequence such that:
	p1p2p3...pm = q1q2q3....qm
is undecidable where pi and qi are parts in voting patterns f1 and f2 as concatenated strings. What this means is that finding a sequence
which makes serialized voters in both patterns equal is undecidable.

Alternative proof of undecidability of Complement Function Construction with PCP :
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Complement Functions are reducible to Post Correspondence Problem. PCP states that finding sequence of numbers i1,i2,i3,...,ik such that:
	s(i1)s(i2)s(i3)....s(ik) = t(i1)t(i2)t(i3)...t(ik)
where s(ik) and t(ik) are strings is undecidable.

Example inductive base case:
-----------------------------
Let f(x) = 2,4,6,8,....
and g(x) = 1,3,5,7,....
f(x) and g(x) are complements of each other.

Define a(i) and b(i) as concatenated ordered pairs of f(xi) and g(xi):
	a1 = 2		b1 = 2,3
	a2 = 3,4	b2 = 4,5
	a3 = 5,6	b3 = 6,7
	a4 = 7,8	b4 = 8,9
	a5 = 9,10	b5 = 10
[e.g a2 = 3, 4 where g(a2) = 3 and f(a2) = 4; b3= 6,7 where f(b3) = 6 and g(b3) = 7 and so on. Here complement of an element is the succeeding element in universal set Z=1,2,3,4,5,... ]

Then, 1,2,3,4,5 is a sequence such that:
	a1a2a3a4a5 = b1b2b3b4b5 = 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
which can be parenthesised in two ways as:
	2(3,4)(5,6)(7,8)(9,10) = (2,3)(4,5)(6,7)(8,9)10 = 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
Each parenthesization is a string representation of a possible way to construct a complement function. Ideally, process of complementation has two symmetric directions created by the gaps in the range a function maps a domain to - predecessors and successors - which is captured by the two parenthesizations(i.e f is complement of g and g is complement of f). Each substring within the parentheses is indexed by sequence numbers ai and bi. Thus an order of sequence numbers have to be found for both symmetric directions to get matching concatenated union of complements (universal set).  Both directions have to converge because complementation is symmetric relation. But finding such an order of sequence numbers is a Post Correspondence Problem and undecidable(question of if turing machine halts on input). Since each a(i) and b(i) are concatenated ordered pair of value of f(x) and its complement g(x), complement function is constructible if such ordered pairs exist for indefinite length. In essence: Finding an order of sequence numbers = Construction of complement functions which converge in opposing directions => Undecidable by Post Correspondence Problem. Above example can be generalized for any function, and its complement ordered pair and thus is an alternative proof (with a tighter definition of complementation that complements are bidirectional) of undecidability of Complement Function Existence and Construction. Another example is 2 parenthesizations for prime complementation below - elements succeeding a prime in left and elements preceding a prime in right:
	f(x) = 2,3,5,7,11,...
	g(x) = 4,6,8,9,10,12,...

	([2,3],4)(5,6)(7,[8,9,10])(11) = ([2,3])(4,5)(6,7)([8,9,10],11) = 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11

Generic inductive case:
-----------------------
	(f(x1),succ(f(x1))(f(x2),succ(f(x2)).... = (predec(g(x1),g(x1))(predec(g(x2),g(x2)).... = Z
	(or)
	concatenation_of(f(xi),g(xi)) = concatenation_of(g(xi),f(xi)) = Z
where succ() and predec() are successor and predecessor functions respectively in lambda calculus jargon and xi take some integer values. This assumes nothing about the sorted order of f(xi) and g(xi) and each ordered pair is arbitrarily sampled and aggregated. f(x) is known and from this complement g(x) has to be constructed(though g(xi) sampled data points are known, g(x) is not). To construct g(x), ordered pairs for g(xi) have to be sequenced as g(0), g(1), ... which amounts to assigning values to xi which is Post Correspondence Problem and undecidable.

Two complementation parenthesizations can be drawn as step function where indentation denotes complementary g points to f in example below:

			|
			| f(1)
			|
			---------
				|
				| g(1)
				|
			---------
			|
			| f(0)
			|
			---------
				|
				| g(0)
				|
				|
			---------
			|
			| f(2)
			---------
				|
				| g(2)
				|

which represent two parenthesization correspondences (sequence on right is staggered by one segment):
	(f(1),g(1))(f(0),g(0))(f(2),g(2)) = (f(1))(g(1),f(0))(g(0),f(2))(g(2)) = f(1)g(1)f(0)g(0)f(2)g(2)
Hence x1,x2,x3 take values 1,0,2 for string on left. String on the right despite staggering also takes values 1,0,2 for x1,x2,x3 with only slight change - 1,0,2 is represented as 1-0, 0-2, 2 by coalescence of any two juxtaposed xi. This correspondence is undecidable by PCP. This complementation scheme relaxes the definition of complements in http://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.4102v1.pdf by allowing the pre-image of complementary function segments to be in unsorted order - e.g 1,0,2 is not sorted.

Two Generic parenthesizations for f and its complement g are:
	[f(x1)][g(y1)f(x2)][g(y2)f(x3)][g(y3)]... = [f(x1)g(y1)][f(x2)g(y2)][f(x3)g(y3)]... = f(x1)g(y1)f(x2)g(y2)f(x3)g(y3)...
where each f(xi) and g(yi) are contiguous streak of set of values of f and g. xi is not necessarily equal to yi. Required sequence numbers are
x1-y1, x2-y2, x3-y3, ... in right and x1, y1-x2, y2-x3, ... in left to make the strings correspond to each other. Here sequence numbers are identifiers which are concatenation of 2 numbers xi and yi as xi-yi or yi-x(i-1). Thus original undecidability of finding x1-y1,x2-y2,x3-y3,... still remains. This is the most relaxed version of complementation.

Another alternative definition of complement function is: function f and its complement g are generating functions for the exact disjoint set cover of size 2 of a universal set formed by values of f and g. Disjoint Set Cover is the set of subsets of a universal set where each element of universal set is contained in exactly one set and their union is the universal set. Notion of complementation can be extended to arbitray dimensional spaces. Each half-space is generated by a function complement to the other. Complementation is also related to concepts of VC-Dimension and Shattering where each half-space is a class classified by complement functions (set A is shattered by a set C of classes of sets if for all subsets s of A, s = c intersection A for c in C)

Complementation Disjoint Set Cover can be represented as bipartite graph where edges are between two sets A and B. Set A has sequence numbers xi(or yi) and set B is the universal set (Z for example). For each f(xi) and g(yi) there is an edge from xi----f(xi) and yi-----g(yi).

Boolean 0-1 majority special case of Hash chains and Complement Functions:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A hash table of size 2 with 2 chains partitions the set of keys into 2 disjoint sets. Each chain in this hash table is created by 2 functions complement to each other (examples previously described: set of odd and even integers, set of primes and composites). Thus if there exists a hash function h that accepts another function f as input and partitions a universal set into two chained buckets with mutually complementary elements belonging to f and g(complement of f), then it is an indirect way to construct a complement. But undecidability of complement construction by post correspondence precludes this.

327. (THEORY) Algorithmic Fairness, Pr(Good) Majority Voting Circuit and Algorithmic Decision Making - Related to 14,53,275,317
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Majority Voting hardness analyzed thus far, voting functions of Individual Human Voters are assumed. Recent advances in algorithmic
decision making (High Frequency Algorithmic Trading, Predictive Policing etc.,) involve decision making by algorithms than humans. It was
implicit so far that algorithms cannot have bias. But there is a new emerging field of algorithmic fairness which highlights growing
bias by machine learning algorithms in decision making (bias could be in training dataset, algorithm's false assumptions leading to
wrong conclusions based on correlations etc.,) that could subvert stock trading buy-sell decisions, criminal justice system and so on. Similar
 unfairness could happen in Majority voting also if the voters are algorithms (algorithm internally using a boolean function, non-boolean
function, past training data to make future decisions among others). Unfair voting algorithms imply that Pr(Good) summation would never
converge to 100% and therefore error is non-zero. Unfair voting is detrimental to distributed cloud computing involving majority voting
choice - e.g loadbalancing of requests get skewed to a node unfairly by bad voting.  Most importantly a proof of existence of 100% fair
voting algorithm implies that LHS of Pr(Good) summation is 1 (From 317.2 least error algorithm is chosen as Non-majority social choice).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.This commit implements locality sensitive hashing in python by wrapping defaultdict with hashing and distance measures.
2.Locality Sensitive Hashing is useful for clustering similar strings or text documents into same bucket and is thus an unsupervised
classifier and an inverted index too.
3.In this implementation, very basic LSH is done by having replicated hashtables and hashing a document to each of these hashtables with
a random polynomial hash function which itself is aggregation of random monomials.
4.For a query string, random hash function is again computed and buckets from all hashtables corresponding to this hash value is returned as
nearest neighbour set.
5.Each of these buckets are sieved to find the closest neighbour for that hashtable.
6.Sorting the nearest neighbours for all hash tables yields a ranking of documents which are in the vicinity of the query string.
7.The input strings are read from a text file LocalitySensitiveHashing.txt
8.Logs with hashtable dumps and nearest neighbour rankings are in testlogs/LocalitySensitiveHashing.out.16September2016

1.NeuronRain already has support for RESTful GUI implemented in Python Tornado and NeuronRain code can be executed by
filling up HTML form pages.
2.ZeroMQ has a lowlevel highly performant low latency concurrency framework for servicing heavily concurrent requests.
3.ZeroMQ is a wrapper socket implementation with special support for Request-Reply, Router-Worker, Pub-Sub design patterns.
4.Important advantage of ZeroMQ is lack of necessity of lock synchronization (i.e ZeroMQ is lock-free per its documentation)
for consistency of concurrent transactions
5.Hence as a CLI alternative to HTTP/REST GUI interface,a C++ client and server have been implemented based on ZeroMQ Request-Reply
Router-Dealer-Worker sockets pattern to serve concurrent requests.
6.ZeroMQ client: ./zeromq_client "<neuronrain executable command>"
7.ZeroMQ server: invokes system() on the executable arg from zeromq client

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Commits - 22 September 2016
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Streaming_AbstractGenerator has been updated to include KingCobra request-reply queue disk persisted store, as
a data storage option (reads /var/log/kingcobra/REQUEST_REPLY.queue). Initial design option was to integrate a Kafka client into
KingCobra kernelspace servicerequest() function which upon receipt of a message from linux kernel workqueue,also publishes it in turn
to a Kafka Topic. But tight coupling of Kafka C Client into KingCobra is infeasible because of conflicts between userspace include header
files of Kafka and kernelspace include header files of Linux. This results in compilation errors. Hence it looks sufficient to read the
persisted KingCobra REQUEST_REPLY.queue by a standalone Kafka python client and publish to Kafka subscribers. This leverages analytics
by python code on KingCobra queue.
2.NeuronRain backend now has a support for Kafka Pub-Sub Messaging.
3.New publisher and subscriber for Kafka (with Python Confluent Kafka) have been written to read data from
Streaming_AbstractGenerator and to publish/subscribe to/from a Kafka Message Broker-Topic. Thus any datasource that
AsFer may have(file,HBase,Cassandra,Hive etc.,) is abstracted and published to Kafka. This also unites AsFer backend
and KingCobra disk persistence into a single Kafka storage.

Ongoing Boost::Python AsFer-VIRGO system call invocation kernel panic analysis:
Random crashes remain, but this time no crash logs are printed in kern.log and finally a successful invocation happens. It could be
same as i915 GEM DRM crash similar to earlier analyses.

Pattern observed is as follows:
        1. First few invocations fail with virgo_get() though virgo_malloc() and virgo_set() succeed.
        2. After few failures all virgo calls succeed - virgo_malloc(), virgo_set() and virgo_get() work without any problems.
        3. Sometimes virgo_parse_integer() logs and few other logs are missing. When all logs are printed, success rate is very high.
        4. Some failing invocations have NULL parsed addresses. When there are no NULL address parsings, success rate is very high.
        5. a rare coincidence was observed: Without internet connectivity crashes are very less frequent. (Intel Microcode
updates playing spoilsport again?).

337. (THEORY) Ramsey Theorem, Edge Labelling of Voting Graph and Multiway Majority Function - 5 October 2016 - related to 256,272,319
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Multiway majority voting can be drawn as a directed graph. There is an edge between vertices v1 and v2 if v1 votes for v2 forming a
Voting Graph with a weight >= 0.  Realworld example of this is web link graph where incoming links to a webpage are votes to it and
outgoing links from a webpage are votes for adjacent pages. PageRank is a special case of Multiway Majority Function which ranks the
candidate webpages by a converging random walk markov chain of transition probabilities, with a rider that all webpages are both voters
and candidates making it a peer-to-peer majority voting. PageRank is thus a Non-boolean voting function. If web link graph is a tree
of depth d, it is equivalent to depth-d recursive majority function.  Edge labelling of a graph assigns colors to edges of a graph
(Edge coloring is a special case of labelling with restriction no two adjacent edges are of same color). Voting graphs can be edge
labelled where each color of an edge denotes a voter affiliation. Ramsey Number in combinatorics states that there exists a number
v=RN(r,s) for every graph of order v, there exists a clique of size r or independent set of size s. For any Voting graph Ramsey Theorem
implies emergence of a clique or an independent set i.e voters who vote among themselves or who do not vote for each other. If the Voting
graph is complete then Ramsey Theorem implies emergence of monochromatic cliques r (red cliques) or s (blue cliques).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Complement Function over Integer sequences can be defined in terms of 2-colorings of the integers. Described previously in (323) PCP
undecidability proof of complementation, a function f and its complement g can be construed as 2-colorings of the Disjoint Set Cover Union i.e
the set of natural numbers - each color is a function - for example f is red and g is blue.

Schur's Theorem for Ramsey coloring of integer sequences states (quoted from http://math.mit.edu/~fox/MAT307-lecture05.pdf):

" ...  Schur's theorem
Ramsey theory for integers is about finding monochromatic subsets with a certain arithmetic structure. It starts with the following theorem of Schur (1916), which turns out to be an easy application of Ramsey's theorem for graphs.

Theorem 3.
For any k >= 2 , there is n > 3 such that for any k-coloring of 1,2,3,...,n, there are three integers x, y, z of the same color such that
x + y = z ...  "

For complement function special case (i.e 2-coloring of the sequences), Schur Theorem implies that there are always integers x,y and z in the image of a function or its complement obeying x+y=z. Van Der Waerden Therem for coloring integers is the variant of Ramsey Theorem for graphs (quoting https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Waerden%27s_theorem):

" ...  for any given positive integers r and k, there is some number N such that if the integers {1, 2, ..., N} are colored, each with one of r different colors, then there are at least k integers in arithmetic progression all of the same color.  ...  "

Van Der Waerden Theorem for 2-colorings of natural numbers is equivalent to complementation disjoint set cover of natural numbers. When this is a prime complementation special case, prime integers are colored in red and composites in blue. Thus Van Der Waerden theorem for prime-composite complementation implies that either set of primes or composites have arithmetic progressions (because of same coloring) of size atleast k (Related: Green-Tao theorem states that primes have arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions). Upperbound for N in this 2-coloring prime complementation is deriveable from [TimothyGowers] bound as: N <= 2^2^2^2^(k+9) for a family of k sized arithmetic progressions (also called as k-regularity). This implies arbitrarily long monochromatic arithmetic progressions can be found in prime-composite complementation by choosing N and k.

Finding the arithmetic progressions for Van Der Waerden numbers have been formulated as SAT instances which involves a SAT solver to search for a satisfying monochromatic arithmetic progression. Similar SAT solving approach applies also to prime-composite bichromatic complementation for finding arithmetic progressions. This takes the notion of complementation a fine grained step further in the sense:  prime-composite complementation is a pattern miner in primes and arithmetic progressions in prime-composite complementation are patterns within pattern.

Concept of complement graphs have been studied in Perfect Graph Theorem and has strong resemblance to function complementation. Complement graph H is obtained from a graph G by adding edges to make it complete graph and removing edges in G i.e H has edges which are not in G and vice versa. Function complementation is precisely a sequence corollary of Graph complementation. Perfect Graph Theorem (PGT) states that a graph is perfect if its complement is perfect where perfect graph is one in which all its induced subgraphs have chromatic number (number of colors required to k-color a graph) equal to size of maximum clique. Function complementation can be translated to Graph complementation by defining a relation: There is an edge in F, f(x1)----f(x2) for every f(x1) and f(x2) and there is an edge in G, g(x1)----g(x2) for every g(x1) and g(x2) where f and g are mutual complements. Obviously F and G have a single maximum clique with an independent set without any edge amongst them. Then it follows that order of F and G are their respective Ramsey Numbers.

A contrived independent set can be created by adding edges from constituent vertices of the maximum clique which is also maximal such that there are no edge overlaps with its complement graph - thus every graph for a function and its complement has a single maximum and maximal clique and an independent set connected only to the clique with no edges among them i.e. Vertices of the clique form vertex cover of the graph

Any 2 graphs corresponding to 2 functions defined on same set obtained from previous construction are isomorphic. For example if a complete graph of 3 vertices (K3) is constructed from elements 2,3,5 for function f1 where f1 is defined as f1(0)=2, f1(1)=3 and f2(2)=5, the vertices can be numbered by the inverse(f1) as 0,1,2. Similarly for a different function f2 over 2,3,5 K3 obtained can be vertex numbered by the inverse(f2) where f2(0)=5, f2(1)=2 and f3(2)=3 where numbering is 1,2,0. This also implies two graphs for function f and its complement g are not isomorphic.

In the context of complement function graphs constructed previously, functions are mapped to maximum clique subgraph and only this subgraph is vertex-renumbered which is the problem of subgraph isomprphism to find out if clique subgraph is isomorphic to another function clique subgraph.

Szemeredi's Theorem which is the generalization of Van Der Waerden's Theorem states: For any subset A of N of natural density > 0, there are infinitely many arithmetic progressions of size atleast k where natural density is defined as lim {n->infinity} sup |A intersection {1,2,3,...,n}|/n > 0. Green-Tao theorem applies a relative Szemeredi theorem because prime numbers have 0 natural density. Szemeredi's Theorem has been generalized to polynomial progressions where the polynomial progression is defined as [t(i) = t(i-1) + p(i)] in A for some integer valued polynomials p(i). Thus Generalized Szemeredi Theorem for Finding polynomial arithmetic progressions in a subset of natural numbers is closest to finding the complement of a function when set of natural numbers is 2-colored - only a subset of complement set is expressed as polynomials whereas complement function requires, by definition, the complete set to be expressed as polynomials (e.g interpolation polynomials, fourier polynomials).

Roth Estimate for 2-coloring of integer sequences (in references 338.4 and 338.5) is a measure of order or randomness in a colored sequence and hence in a complementation by functions f and g (where each function is a color - e.g f is blue and g is red) over a universal set. If arithmetic progressions are thought of as all possible "sampled points" on 2-colored integers (functions f and g) i.e an approximation of f and g,then Roth estimate is a measure of difference in size of f(x) and g(x) with probability equal to natural density of arithmetic progression chosen in minimax() step. This is because natural density is a fraction of size of set of elements of an arithmetic progression on natural numbers - in other words, natural density is the size of a sample of f and g. From Roth estimate bounds, |{f(x)}| - |{g(x)}| is approximately N^(1/4+epsilon) with probability equal to natural density of arithmetic progression in minimax() step and |{f(x)}| + |{g(x)}| is N with probability 1. This implies:
	|{f(x)}| = {N+N^(1/4+epsilon)} / 2
	|{g(x)}| = {N-N^(1/4+epsilon)} / 2
	with probability equal to natural density of arithmetic progression in minimax()
Previous approximation with sampling relates size of complement functions,coloring and arithmetic progressions by Roth estimate.

Complement Graphs F and G constructed previously for function f and its complement g have set of all values of inverse(f) and inverse(g) as the respective vertex labels in their maximum monochromatic cliques. This maps a 2-colored integer sequence with each color representing a function to 2 graphs, mutually complement, each with a maximal monochromatic clique for respective function (f or g) and an independent set of other color. This construction adds one more dimension to the coloring problem: numbering of vertices for either color and subgraph isomorphism. From Van Der Waerden and later newer theorems, this implies numbered vertices in F and G have atleast one monochromatic arithmetic progression.

Another important question is: Can a complement function polynomial be constructed from constituent monochromatic arithmetic progressions (or) Is the complement function polynomial interpolated by Lagrange Theorem or Fourier Analysis a composition of constituent arithmetic progressions? This is answered in reference 338.11 - Interpolation Polynomial for n points can be approximated from low discrepancy arithmetic progressions. References 338.12 and 338.13 are related to Polynomial Sequences of length n (P(n) - Polynomial Points) represented by rings of polynomials F(x) with integer coefficients in Zn and for each sequence S(k)=(a1,a2,...,an) there exists a polynomial f(x) in F(x) such that f(i)=ai,i=1,2,3,...,n (f(x) is a Lagrange Interpolation Polynomial). For example, monochromatic arithmetic progressions from Van Der Waerden and other theorems are polynomial sequences represented by arithmetic progression polynomial points. Thus Complement Function Polynomial interpolated (Fourier or Lagrange) from maximal monochromatic subset of 2-colored integer sequence is a Polynomial point and corresponding maximum monochromatic sequence subset is Polynomial Sequence.

Let f1,f2,f3,... be functions and g1,g2,g3,... be their respective complements. They are represented as graphs constructed previously as F1,F2,F3,....(each with a monochromatic red clique and independent set of blue color) and G1,G2,G3,... (each with a monochromatic blue clique and independent set of red color). All fi(s) have isomorphic red clique subgraphs and gi(s) have isomorphic blue subgraphs. Vertices are numbered with fiinverse() and giinverse() labels. Vertices of cliques in fi(s) and gi(s) have monochromatic arithmetic progressions in fi(vertexlabel) and gi(vertexlabel).For each arithmetic progression APj in monochromatic clique in Fk corresponding to fk(),fkinverse(APj) is the preimage of APj. Define AP1,AP2,AP3,AP4,AP5,... as the monochromatic arithmetic progressions in a monochromatic clique (vertices corresponding to some function fk()). Union of APj is a subset of fk(). Define C(x) as the interpolation polynomial of the Union of APj. C(x) is an approximation of fk(). Accuracy of approximation is determined by the density ratio |C(x)|/|fk()|.When Union of APj covers all points in sequence for generating function fk(), then density is 1 because C(x) is 100% correct approximation of fk() - C(x) = fk(). A naive construction of C(x) from APj is done by parallel mergesort of: AP1,AP2,AP3,AP4,AP5,...,APn to get a total ordering. Interpolation on the merged splintered arithmetic progressions scattered over the sequence gives an approximation C(x) of fk(). This construction is in NC. Let Interpolation polynomial for the sequence be P(x)=fk().
There are 2 possibilities of arithmetic progressions - APs have both colors (elements from both function and its complement) or APs are all monochromatic (elements from a function or its complement).For example the sequence 1,2,3,4,5,.... of natural numbers have two arithmetic progressions:
	AP1 = 2x+1 => 1,3,5,7,9,.....
	AP2 = 3x+1 => 1,4,7,11,14,....
Merging them gives 1,3,4,5,7,9,10,11,13.... which is a subset of 1,2,3,4,5,....
----------------------------
Scenario1: Monochromatic APs
----------------------------
Approximation polynomial for sequence interpolated from constituent monochromatic APs mergesorted = C(x). Let AP1(x),AP2(x),AP3(x),...,APn(x) be the arithmetic progression polynomials. Let C(x) = E(x)AP1(x)AP2(x)AP3(x)...APn(x) i.e arithmetic progressions are factors of C(x) with E(x) as quotient over some polynomial ring F[x]. C(x) approximates a function fk() or its complement gk(). This is described previously.
-----------------------------
Scenario2: Multichromatic APs
-----------------------------
When APs have elements of both colors (from both functions fk() and gk()), parallel mergesort of APs and interpolation by polynomial C(x) cannot approximate either fk() or gk() because APs consist of both colors. This is where minimum discrepancy plays its part - when discrepancy is low AP has elements from both colors or functions in almost equal number. Therefore arithmetic progression samples both functions with least error and interpolation succeeds with high accuracy - this is an intuitive explanation for 338.11.

the sequence of votes into 2 monochromatic sets. Obviously, if the voters are uniquely identified by a sequence number, all sequence coloring

Polynomial Reconstruction Problem states that:
Given a set of n points (x1,y1),(x2,y2),...,(xn,yn) recover all polynomials p of degree less than k such that pi(xi) != yi
for maximum of i points in {1,2,3,...,n}. In other words PRP is a curve-fitting interpolation problem and is related to
Error correcting problems like List Decoding (list of polynomials approximating a message one of which is correct),Reed-Solomon Codes.

2-Coloring scheme algorithms and Complement Function constructions are alternative spectacles to view the Polynomial Reconstruction

CD/DVD storage devices contain binary data burnt on concentric cylindrical tracks. A radial line from central bull's eye of the circular storage to outer rim crosscuts the data to form a binary string of length n where n is the radius of circular storage. This radial line sweeping the
complete circle in a scan covers 2^n possible binary strings. In the best case all 2^n words are distinct. Total Number of 1s or 0s in these
2^n words are in fibonacci sequence:
	f(n) = 2f(n-1) + 2^(n-1)
with f(0)=0 and f(1)=1. In 2-coloring parlance, DVD is 2-colored with 1(red) and 0(blue) where number of monochromatic bits is lower
bounded by:
	f(n) = 2f(n-1) + 2^(n-1) out of minimum n*2^n possible bits on the storage. Thus any data written to storage ultimately gets translated into a 2-coloring complement function scheme.For example, device with 3 concentric tracks has 3*2^3=24 minimum possible bit positions and:
	f(3) = 2f(2) + 2^2 = 2(2f(1) + 2) + 2^2 = 8 + 4 = 12 minimum possible monochromatic bit positions
This has some applications of Hales-Jewitt Theorem for multidimensional 2-coloring - storage device always has a monochromatic k-line.(where k is dimension and k-line is a hyperline. 2-line is a square and 3-line is a cube). As a simple example for n=2:
	00
	01
	10
	11
are minimum possible distinct binary words swept by a radial scan of the circle and there are f(2)=2f(1) + 2 = 4 monochromatic bits spread across out of 2*2^2=8 possible bits in 4 binary strings. A crucial insight is that any high level data stored has an order in low level 2-coloring or Complement Function scheme (Monochromatic APs etc.,) though high level data is usually alphanumeric and appears random. A conjectural question is: Does the low level 2-coloring binary order imply high level non-binary order and are they functionally related?

The previous question has been answered in 2.10.  There could be \/ shaped gaps in circular arrangement of 2^n binary word radial lines. These gaps could be resolved by recursive application of f(n) for all lengths < n. Let this new function be g(n) defined as:
	g(n) = f(n) + f(n-1) + f(n-2) + ... + f(1) + f(0)
Thus g(n) is the tightest bound for number of 1s and 0s. Prefix "minimum" has been added in this bound because repetitions of some binary words in radial line during circular scan have been ignored and hence a lowerbound. Total number of bit positions is k*2*pi*(1+2+3+...+n) = k*2*pi*n(n+1)/2 summing up all concentric tracks for some constant k. Lowerbound g(n) for 1s and 0s implies a unique distribution of all binary word patterns and any number above this lowerbound implies predominance and emergence of a binary pattern.

348. (THEORY) Kleinberg Lattice , Random Graph Ontologies, Bose-Einstein model and Recursive Gloss Overlap algorithm for ranking documents by intrinsic merit - 3 December 2016 and 20 December 2016 - related to 202, 229 and 230
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Result of r=2 in [Kleinberg - 202.19] is an equilibrium state. Random shortcut edges are created with some probabilities between any two nodes n1 and n2 on a lattice of all possible nodes. Thus there are 2 distance measures between any two nodes on a lattice - 1) lattice distance which is the usual manhattan distance step function - this is circuitous. 2) random edge distance between pair of vertices n1 and n2 on the lattice which is shortcut. The random edge has the probability as a function of lattice distance:
	random edge probability(d(n1,n2)) = |l(n1,n2)|^(-r) where l is the lattice distance
When r is less than 2 or close to zero, random edges are as numerous as lattice edges (random edges exist in abundance but they are no better than lattice paths) and when r is more than 2, random edges are rarer (random edges fade, only lattice paths are possible and no shortcut random paths) and it is difficult to find a path for message to be delivered from one extreme to the other. Steady state converges and these two conflicts are resolved when r=2 and it is optimum to find a path between two nodes.

Above small world phenomenon can be mapped to ontology of linguistic concepts/words. Let set of all concepts/words form a lattice. Set of random edges with probability embeds a random graph on some or all of these lattice points and thus is a probabilistic ontology - probability depends on distance measure of 2 concepts. Document definition graph obtained from this ontology with recursive gloss overlap is optimal (easy to find path between concepts in a document and grasp meaning) when it has r=2 by previous lattice-randomedge relation. Usual distance measures are based on least common ancestor principle - node which is conceptually common to two other nodes creates a path. Lower the distance, greater the meaningfulness. Reference 202.20 adds disambiguation to finding distance by aligning and intersecting all possible senses of two concepts with a random walk and doing argmax() to find distance. Probabilistic random edge ontology created on a lattice of concepts provides dynamism in text analytics.

Kleinberg criterion of r=2 is an alternative way to assess the meaningfulness of a document. Document definition graph with r=2 should theoretically have easy paths between concepts and average short distance measures across nodes and hence has high intrinsic merit. From the above relation:
	r * log(l(n1,n2)) = log(1/d(n1,n2))
When r=2:
	2log(l(n1,n2)) = log(1/d(n1,n2))
which stipulates conditions for high intrinsic merit for a document in terms of lattice distance and random edge probability between two concepts n1 and n2.

Bose-Einstein model for networks relates fitness of a vertex (ability to attract edges) in a graph and Bose-Einstein condensation. Kleinberg's small-world graph has average clustering coefficient significantly higher than a random graph and mean shortest distance approximately same as random graph (on same vertices). Here clustering coefficient is the ratio of number of edges to neighbours and number of all possible edges to neighbours. Kleinberg's small-world graph, Bose-Einstein condensation in network graphs and Intrinsic meaningfulness merit in graph representation of documents are closely related because all three are multiple views of "meaningfulness" or "connectedness" in a document.

State of a subatomic particle is defined by a wave function on Hilbert Space (Complex State Vector Space). In Dirac notation wave function for particle p is, |p> = a1|s1> + a2|s2> + ... + an|sn> is state of a particle where each ai is a complex number named amplitude of particle at state si - particle's state is a linear superposition of all states si with amplitude ai. Dirac delta function is fourier transform of Schroedinger wave equation of a particle. State vector |p> is a linear superposition of all possible alternatives (or) Hilbert space dimensions that a particle can exist with respective amplitude for each dimension. Set of states form orthonormal basis for this Hilbert space. Wave function state vector collapses to one of the states to give a classical probability for the state estimated by square of amplitude for the state dimension. For example, in Young's Double Slit experiment a single photon acts as a wave by duality and interferes with itself by travelling through both slits to establish an interference pattern with state vector wavefunction amplitudes which collapses to a classical probability when one of the slits is closed. Schroedinger's  cat paradox is an imaginary thought experiment (not possible in reality) where a black box with cat and a radioactive material triggered by a particle's spin exists in both states dead and alive simultaneously when viewed from outside with amplitude 1/sqrt(2): |state of cat> =  1/sqrt(2) ( |dead> + |alive> ). Squaring amplitude 1/sqrt(2) gives classical probability 1/2 for each state. There are two observers - one within the black box and one outside of it. For observer within black box, particle spin is measurable and wavefunction collapses to one of the states "dead or alive" while for observer outside black box there is no way for such collapse to occur and state is a superposition "dead and alive".

In terms of BigData analytics, learning a variable in a blackbox is reducible to Schroedinger's Cat paradox. Assuming there exists a Pseudorandom Generator with Quantum Mechanical source, Cat is an algorithm with access to randomness - e.g Double Slit experiment, radioactive decay etc., and chooses one of the alternative outputs - output1, output2, ..., outputn - based on quantum mechanical measurement (e.g spin) with "if...else" branches. This randomized algorithm can be thought of as a subroutine F. Observer1 which measures output of F is another subroutine G. Thus both F and G together constitute the blackbox. Observer2 outside the blackbox is another subroutine H. Only G measures output of F and state vector collapses to one of the alternative outputs. But for H, F+G is impervious and state vector remains as: a1|output1> + a2|output2> +...+ an|outputn> with complex amplitudes ai. This extends the notion of Pseudorandomness in traditional complexity literature to a more generic state vector with complex amplitudes over a Hilbert space of dimensions(alternatives) - here algorithm is itself a "particle" with a superposed state of outputs.

Any BigData set with apparent randomness can be construed as a series of outputs over time generated by a randomized algorithm (or) an algorithm with access to randomness including quantum mechanical randomness (For example, streamed datasets like stock market tickers) i.e the algorithm F. Subroutines F+G together create a BigData set from randomness. When viewed from H, the blackbox F+G has a state vector wavefunction evolving over time: W(t) = a1|output1> + a2|output2> + ... + an|outputn>. Any machine learning algorithm which tries to learn patterns from such a dataset is equivalent to what H does above. If H learns the pattern in the dataset with x% accuracy, it implies algorithms F+G are reverse engineered with x% correctness. This presents a contradiction if the source of randomness is quantum mechanical - state vector collapses for both observers G and H, not only for G. If Schroedingers cat paradox is axiomatically true, it raises questions: Does this limit the scope of machine learning to only classical randomness? Is quantum randomness not learnable?

An alternative formulation of F+G is:
F is the quantum randomness source (e.g Double slit) and G invokes (or measures) F to produce a datastream over time. Here G as observer within blackbox is an inseparable entity from F i.e F is an internal routine of G.

There are two levels of learning possible:
*) Learning within blackbox - Learning patterns from observations of F+G. F+G are pre-equipped with ability to learn patterns in collapsed wavefunction generated dataset. Such a pattern learnt exists only within the blackbox. External observer H has no way to learn the dataset and the pattern. Even within F+G there are problems with learning patterns from quantum randomness. Logical independence implies any two observations (boolean propositions) are independent and learning pattern from such independent observations contradicts it - pattern in independent observations imply observations are dependent on each other. For example, two propositions "Today is holiday" and "There are 100 cars" are logically independent while propositions "There are 100 flights" and "There are 100 cars" are logically dependent. Former 2 propositions have no common patterns while latter 2 propositions have a common pattern (100, vehicles) - new information "100 and vehicles" is deducible from 2 propositions. Quantum randomness stems from logical independence and thus there should not be a common pattern to learn from independent streaming set of observations.

*) Learning outside blackbox - This is obvious contradiction mentioned previously because dataset generated by F+G is never visible to H because wavefunction of H never collapses.

Thus above seems to imply learning is impossible with quantum randomness.

Discrete Hyperbolic Factorization draft in 34 claims (disputed because of input size though references exist to prove PRAM=NC equivalence and Bitonic Batcher Sort is in NC) that integers can be factored by NC parallel computation circuit of logdepth and polynomial size (by PRAM or Cloud Bitonic sorting). Similar parallelism is the basis for Quantum Factorization Algorithm of [Shor] - factorization is in BQP and NC is in BQP. Quantum Computation relies on two phenomena:
	*) Quantum Parallelism in which a function f(x) is computed to get many values of f(x) in parallel
	*) Quantum Interference by Hadamard transform where cancellation occurs ( |0> = 1/sqrt(2)*(|0>+|1>) and |1> = 1/sqrt(2)*(|0>-|1>) ) by interference

Period Finding in Quantum Computation finds smallest r such that f(x)=f(x+r) and Shor's factorization internally applies period finding by quantum fourier transform. Ramsey theory of integers and related theorems viz., Van Der Waerden, Szemeredi etc., imply existence of monochromatic arithmetic progressions in 2-coloring of integer sequences where each color is equivalent to a function and its complement. Period finding problem reduces to finding arithmetic progressions in integer sequences by defining a function f(x+iy)=f(x+(i+1)y) for any x in the sequence and some integers y and i. More generically, factoring and period finding are special cases of Hidden Subgroup Problem i.e f(g)=f(hg) for g in G and h in subgroup H of G and hG is a coset of H. In terms of polynomial reconstruction, period finding computes the function f passing through the arithmetic progression points. In Discrete Hyperbolic Factorization of 34, instead of quantum parallelism , classical NC parallelism is applied to k-merge sort and binary search the pixelated hyperbola tiles.

*) Input to python-src/DeepLearning_ReinforcementLearningRecommenderSystems.py is a set of observations which are user activities
(shopping cart items, academic articles read by user etc.,) and already built thoughtnet hypergraph history is searched by usual
evocatives from the input
*) Evocatives returned from ThoughtNet hypergraph are items recommended relevant to user's activities.
*) This technique of recommendation is more qualitative than usual methods of Collaborative Filtering and mimicks the human

353. (FEATURE-DONE) An example usecase of Recommender Systems for online shopping cart - 2 January 2017
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*) RecommenderSystems folder has been updated with new text file from an example past shopping cart history items (e.g books from miscellaneous
topics in Amazon online bookstore)
*) From the above edges a Hypergraph is created by classifying the shopping cart items into classes and constructing hyperedges across the
classes (by Recursive Gloss Overlap Graph maximum core number classifier)
*) Text files for above usecase have .shoppingcart suffixes
*) Above shopping cart hypergraph has a past history of items chosen by a user from variety of topics.
*) New input file RecommenderSystems.shoppingcart.input.txt has present items in user's shopping cart and new items have to be recommended to
user based on present choice and past history.
*) For this, items in present shopping cart are lookedup in past sales history Hypergraph created previously and recommendations are returned
*) Items in present shopping cart are looked up in two ways: 1) By classifying with Recursive Gloss Overlap graph and looking up rare classes
less than a threshold (presently core number 5) and 2) Raw token lookup
*) Logs for these two lookups based Recommendations generated are committed to testlogs/

An important note: Rationale for Hypergraph based past history is that a meaningful text can be classified on multiple classes vis-a-vis usual
supervised classifiers which classify text on exactly one class. This is more realistic because text can delve into multiple topics simultaneusly e.g an article on medical imaging (MRI scans) could contain details also on nuclear physics and pattern recognition and can exist in 3 classes simultaneously. There are still impurities in recommendations generated from lookups as gleaned from logs. These are inaccuracies in the way WordNet infers because of small size of the text description about book. Larger the description per shopping cart item, greater is the information connectedness of the WordNet subgraph generated and accuracy of core number based classification.

355. (THEORY) NEXP not in non-uniform ACC, P(Good) majority voting circuit and some contradictions - 4 January 2017 and 5 January 2017
- related to all P(Good) majority voting circuit related points in this document (e.g 14,53 etc.,)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RHS of P(Good) majority voting circuit has exponential size with unrestricted depth in worst case and is in EXP (if depth restricted , RHS is in PH direct-connect uniform circuit). RHS is a boolean function composition of non-uniform NC and individual voter decision functions. Known
result by [RyanWilliams] limits that NEXP is not in ACC (AC circuits with counter mod[m] gates which output 1 if sum of inputs is a multiple
of m). Non uniform ACC is contained in TC and AC is contained in ACC (AC in ACC in TC). This makes a contradiction if LHS is 100% efficient
percolation circuit in non-uniform NC (NC/poly). If P(Good) binomial coefficient series summation converges to 100%, then RHS majority voting circuit is also 100% efficient and LHS=RHS. This implies if RHS has NEXP-complete algorithm/circuit, because of convergence, NEXP is in NC/poly. But NC is in ACC and this implies NEXP has non-uniform ACC circuits - contradicts NEXP does not have non-uniform ACC circuits. This is one
more counterexample implying some or all of the following:
       *) There is no 100% efficient RHS majority voting boolean function composition
       *) There is no 100% efficient LHS boolean function (pseudorandomly chosen boolean function, ranked by social choice function etc.,)
       *) RHS Majority voting is not in NEXP.
       *) LHS pseudorandom choice boolean cannot have a non-uniform NC circuit
Above, "efficiency" implies "No error" cases in scenarios matrix of 53.14 and a ninth error scenario of Randomized Decision Tree Evaluation Error(zero-error decision tree evaluation) mentioned in 314, 317. This adds one more possibility where P(Good) binomial summation for majority voting diverges already mentioned in 53.16.3.1, 256, 265, 275. Ranking by social choice function includes Interview algorithm implemented in Asfer and any other ranking function. Thus there exists a setting where both LHS and RHS fail to converge. It has to be noted that above counterexamples do not rule out the possibility of convergence of LHS and RHS of P(Good) circuit. There could be decision functions which adhere to "no error" cases in 10 possibilities as below:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        x                               |    f(x) = f(x/e)      |       f(x) != f(x/e) Noise    |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x in L, x/e in L                        |       No error        |       Error                   |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x in L, x/e not in L                    |       Error           |   No error if f(x)=1,f(x/e)=0 |
                                        |                       |   else Error                  |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x not in L, x/e in L                    |       Error           |   No error if f(x)=0,f(x/e)=1 |
                                        |                       |   else Error                  |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x not in L, x/e not in L                |       No error        |      Error                    |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       x                                |                       f(x)                           |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Randomized Decision tree evaluation     |       No error       |       Error                   |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If LHS social choice ranking function is Interview algorithm which is a PSPACE=IP algorithm (by straightforward reduction from polynomial round prover-verifier protocol) or a PSPACE function fitting within "No error" scenarios in matrix above, then an unrestricted depth 100% errorfree RHS EXP circuit could imply, EXP=PSPACE. Hence whether such perfect resilient errorfree decision functions in previous "No error" cases can be learnt is an open question.

There are natural processes like Soap Bubble formation known to solve Steiner Tree NP-hard problem efficiently. Soap Bubbles between two
glass plates are formed and bubbles are connected by line segments of optimum total length which converge at Steiner vertices. Voting is a
also a natural process with human element involved. Does human judgement overwhelm algorithmic judgement in decision correctness is also an
open question. If neural networks are algorithmic equivalents of human reasoning, then each voter decision function could be a TC (threshold) circuit and majority voting could be a composition of NC majority function with TC voter circuit inputs. Thus entire RHS of P(Good) is a huge
non-uniform TC neural network. Error of majority voting is then equal to error of this majority function + neural network composition i.e majority voting involving humans is BPTC algorithm.

Previous matrix of 10 scenarios basically subdivides the traditional BP* definition which says: For x in L, a BP* turing machine accepts with probability > 2/3 and for x not in L rejects with probability > 2/3. In other words, a BP* algorithm allows false positives and false negatives and thus errs in "judgement" with probability 1/3. All "Error" entries in the previous matrix are :
	*) (f(x)=f(x/e)) in which case two correlated strings one in L and other not in L are both accepted (false positive) and rejected by f (false negative)
	*) (f(x) != f(x/e) - Noise sensitivity) in which case two correlated strings in L or not in L are erroneously accepted and rejected by f (false positives and false negatives)
	*) Previous two are input related while the last scenario with error in decision tree evaluation is internal to the boolean function itself with false positive and negative decision tree evaluation based on pseudorandom advice bits.

This false positive + false negative voter judgement error applies to BPTC NC+neural network circuit composition also described previously. Derandomizing BPTC should give a non-uniform TC circuit for RHS of P(Good) majority voting implying zero-error voting by neural network voters. This non-uniform TC circuit is an alternative way to specify the enormity of RHS earlier described by PH=DC (depth restricted) and EXP (depth unrestricted) classes. Thus these two unbounded circuit models for RHS of P(Good) majority voting are equivalent: non-uniform TC and EXP. But ACC is contained in TC and NEXP is not in non-uniform ACC. This does not rule out the possibility that EXP has non-uniform TC circuits which is a superset of ACC.

356. (FEATURE-DONE) PythonSpark+Cython Interview Algorithm cloud implementation update - 4 January 2017 - related to 348
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PythonSpark+Cython Cloud Implementation of Interview Algorithm has been updated to print average clustering coefficient of the definition
graph for text. Average clustering coefficient is average(per node clustering coefficient) for all nodes where clustering coefficient of
a vertex is a ratio of edges to neighbours to all possible edges to neighbours (or) amount of "cliqueness" of each neighbourhood of all
vertices in a graph. This adds an alternative way for computing intrinsic merit of a document recursive gloss overlap graph mentioned in
348 (Kleinberg's small world graph and clustering coeffient = 2). Average clustering coefficient supplements the intrinsic merit quantitative
score in deciding semantic relatedness of a graph. Closer the clustering coefficient is to 2, it is easier to find paths in graph of a text
and greater the linguistic meaningfulness.

357. (THEORY) P(Good) non-majority versus majority social choices, BPTC and PSPACE classes - related to 317,355 - 6 January 2017
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Caution: Following tries to prove a major lowerbound result with some assumptions and is subject to errors.

Main motivation for so much emphasis on P(Good) binomial summation convergence is: LHS is non-majority social choice and RHS is majority
social choice and convergence to 100% on both sides implies LHS and RHS are of equal merit with varying complexity classes giving a lowerbound. In non-majority social choice one of the elements in the population set has to be chosen without voting. If there are n voters and out of them m are of x% goodness, probability of pseudorandom choice to have x% efficiency = m/n. If LHS is an Interview algorithm based social choice,
choice process is as follows:

foreach(voter)
{
       Interview the voter (a PSPACE-complete problem where polynomial number of question-answering reduces to prover-verifier protocol)
}
Rank the voters by merit and choose the topmost as non-majority social choice - voting is obviated.

It is interesting to note that web search engines use both non-majority (Ranking by merit) and majority choice (e.g PageRank,Hub-Authority) to rank websites. Above algorithm is polynomial time in number of voters. Previous loop is parallelizable per voter and could be an NC circuit with PSPACE algorithms as inputs. Thus effectively LHS is a PSPACE algorithm. RHS majority voting is better approximated by BPTC circuit with threshold neural network circuits for each voter, mentioned previously. It is known that BPP is in PSPACE. Thus LHS interview social choice with error is already accounted for in PSPACE. This equates an error-prone LHS PSPACE-complete problem to an error-prone RHS BPTC problem. BPTC is in BPP (couldn't find reference for this, but looks obvious because every TC circuit with error can be simulated by a polynomial time Turing Machine with error). This implies BPTC is in PSPACE because BPP is in PSPACE. If equal error on both LHS and RHS implies a lowerbound, LHS PSPACE-complete interview non-majority social choice has a BPTC majority social choice circuit and therefore all PSPACE problems are in BPTC. These two directions together imply PSPACE=BPTC. But BPTC is in BPP and BPP is in PSPACE implying PSPACE=BPP. From https://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~regan/papers/ComplexityPoster.jpg, this might imply a collapse of entire Polynomial Hierarchy upto second level and some consequences for NP and coNP.

358. (THEORY) KRW Conjecture on Boolean Function Composition, Non-majority (PSPACE) and Majority (harder than PSPACE) cicuits -
related to 14,53,311,357 - 7 January 2017
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Previous point mooted the idea of the parallel interview of voters and ranking them as a non-majority social choice. This requires sorting
the interview algorithm scores of individual voters and finding topmost. Sorting of numbers is in AC=NC=TC (Sorting networks, parallel sorting,
 [ChandraStockMeyerVishkin] Constant Depth Reducibility for Sorting - http://www.cstheory.com/stockmeyer@sbcglobal.net/csv.pdf etc.,
Threshold circuits for sorting) and each voter's PSPACE-complete interview circuit is input to NC sorting circuit to find non-majority social choice. Thus LHS is a circuit composition of NC and PSPACE voter interview circuits denoted as NC+PSPACE. RHS of P(Good) is, as already mentioned by neural network approximation, a bounded probabilistic non-uniform BPTC circuit which is a circuit composition of BPNC and voter BPTC circuits denoted as BPNC+BPTC.  If circuit compositions NC+PSPACE = PSPACE and BPNC+BPTC = BPTC then LHS is a PSPACE algorithm to RHS BPTC algorithm assuming equal error.

This creates a following intriguing possibility: If RHS majority voting has voter functions harder than PSPACE (i.e EXP, EXPSPACE, NEXP, coNEXP etc., and not in BPTC) , under equal error assumption, LHS PSPACE-complete non-majority interview algorithm lowerbounds the RHS. PSPACE is in EXP and EXP is in PSPACE. Thus equal error assumption for lowerbound raises possibilities of PSPACE=EXP, PSPACE=NEXP, PSPACE=coNEXP, PSPACE=EXPSPACE etc., It has to be observed that both PSPACE and other harder-than-PSPACE classes contain PP(Probabilistic Polynomial) and thus derandomization (error removal) is implicit. KRW Conjecture for Boolean Function Composition of two boolean functions f and g says: DepthComplexity(f + g) ~ DepthComplexity(f) + DepthComplexity(g). PSPACE-complete interview is equivalent to a TrueQBF phi(q1,a1,q2,a2,...,qn,an) computed by an Alternating Turing Machine (AP=PSPACE) where "forall" quantifier is equivalent to a question qi and "exists" quantifier is equivalent to its answer ai. It is not known if there is a Circuit Composition equivalent of KRW conjecture for depth-size lowerbound of composition of two circuits and it is assumed that NC+(PSPACE=AP) = PSPACE because PSPACE is harder than NC and composition of NC with PSPACE should increase circuit depth proportional to number of quantifiers in interview TQBF. RHS BPNC+BPTC=BPTC is somewhat obvious because NC=TC=AC and only circuit depth-size increases when composed.

359. (THEORY) Non-majority social choices - Interview Ranking Function and Pseudorandom Choice Function - 11 January 2017 - related to
317, 358 and all other non-majority versus majority voting points
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Previous sections mentioned about two possible ways of non-majority social choice:
	*) Parallel interview of voters and ranking based on sorted interview scores
	*) Psuedorandom choice

------------------
Interview circuit:
------------------
Error in interview circuit which is an NC sorting network with PSPACE-complete voter interviews as inputs is defined in usual sense as:
False positives + False negatives + False questions = Percentage of wrong answers marked as right + Percentage of right answers marked as wrong + Percentage of wrong questions

For sorting purposes output of TQBF is not a binary 0 or 1 but a binary string with value equal to number of correct answers. Like all
other boolean functions sensitivity of TQBF phi(q1,a1,q2,a2,q3,a3,...,qn,an) is defined as how flipping of qi and ai affects the output.
Formally,
	Sensitivity(TQBF) = Pr(TQBF(X) != TQBF(Xcorrelated)) where Xcorrelated is an interview with erroneous questions and answers.

Thus sensitivity captures the error in interview. It has to be noted that wrong questions also measure the flaw in interview process while wrong answer to a right question is already accounted for by a binary 0. When sensitivity of TQBF is 0, interview is flawless and LHS if P(good) is 1. BKS Majority is least stable conjecture by [Benjamini-Kalai-Schramm] predicts existence of a linear threshold function with stability greater than Majority function of n variables, n odd. Interview Circuit which is a composition of an NC sorting network with PSPACE TQBF interviews of voters, is also a linear threshold function which outputs candidate above a threshold (i.e sum of correct answers > threshold). If Stability(Interview) > Stability(Majority) then it is a proof of BKS conjecture. For large n, Stability(Majority) = 1-2/pi*(delta). When delta is close to 1, Stability(Majority) tends to 0.35.

--------------------
Pseudorandom Choice:
--------------------
Set of all voter decision functions is partitioned into n sets where each set has goodness xi. Here goodness of a voter decision function f
is defined as: 1-error(f).

Let number of voter decision functions with goodness xi = m(xi). Thus N = m(x1)+m(x2)+m(x3)+...+m(xn)
Expected goodness of a PRG choice is:
	1/N * summation(xi*m(xi)) = (x1*m(x1) + x2*m(x2) + x3*m(x3) + ... + xn*m(xn)) / N
When all voter functions have goodness 1 then PRG choice in LHS of P(good) has goodness 1.

These two non-majority choices are just hypothetical examples of how a social choice can be made without voting. In reality how non-majority
social choice occurs is quite complex and determined by various factors of society ( economic disparities, ethnicity etc.,)

360. (FEATURE-DONE) Commits - 11 January 2017 - DeepLearning Convolution Networks update
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some changes done to Convolution computation:
*) Made sigmoid perceptron optional in final neural network from Maxpooling layer so that weighted sum is printed instead of sigmoid value
*) This causes the convolution network to be very sensitive to presence of pattern
*) 2 more example bitmaps have been added with varying degree of pattern prominence (a pronounced X and a thin 1)
*) With this final neurons from maxpooling layer print values of neurons which quite closely reflect the pattern's magnitude: Huge pattern
results in big value while small pattern results in small value proportionately.
*) This can rank the bitmaps in increasing degree of magnitude of pattern presence
*) Logs for this have been committed to testlogs

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
361. (FEATURE-DONE) DeepLearning Convolution Network - an example pattern recognition from bitmap images - 12 January 2017
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*) Few more bitmap images have been included with same pattern but of different sizes
*) There are 5 patterns and 9 bitmaps:
        - Thin X and Boldfaced X
        - Thin 0 and Boldfaced 0
        - Thin 8 and Boldfaced 8
        - No pattern
        - Thin 1 and Boldfaced 1
*) Expectation is that Convolution Network final neuron layer must output similar values for same pattern and different values
for different patterns
*) pooling_neuron_weight has been reintroduced in final neuron layer of 10 neurons each with a randomly chosen weight.
*) Logs show for all 10 neurons, final neural activation values are close enough for similar patterns and different for different patterns.
*) Thus Convolution Network which is a recent advance in DeepLearning works quite well to recognize similar image patterns.

In above example , 9th and 10th neurons output following values. Example 11 and 12 are similar patterns - 0 and 0. Example 21 and 22 are similar patterns - 8 and 8. Example 41 and 42 are similar patterns - X and X. Example 51 and 52 are similar patterns - 1 and 1. Neurons reflect this similarities :

364. (THEORY and IMPLEMENTATION) Polynomial Encoding of a Text and 2 new distance measures based on it - related to 2.9
- 19 January 2017
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*) It has been earlier mentioned that an alphanumeric text can be construed as a polynomial defined as f:position->alphabet
*) This python implementation encodes a text as a polynomial by applying NumPy Polyfit function on ordinal values of the text
letter positions as y-axis and letter positions as x-axis.
*) A sample polynomial plotted with matplotlib has been added to testlogs/ alongwith logs
*) Once a text is plotted as a polynomial curve, it is natural to define distance between two strings as distance
between two respective polynomial encodings.
*) Usual distance measures for strings e.g Edit distance are somewhat qualitative and do not quantify in numeric terms exactly.
*) Distance between polynomials of two texts is numerically quite sensitive to small changes in texts and visually match the
definition of "distance" between two polynomials of strings.

There are two distance functions defined for polynomial representation of texts:
*) Distance between polynomials is defined by inner product of polynomials f(x) and g(x) and in discrete version is the
L2 norm : sum(i(f(xi)-g(xi))^2)
*) Distance between polynomials considering them as two discrete set of probability distributions - Kullback-Leibler and Jensen-Shannon
 Divergence measures.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For example following are two polynomials fitted for ordinal values of 2 texts and comparative distance values are printed for
edit distance and 2 polynomial distance measures:

365. (THEORY) BKS conjecture and Stability of Interview TQBF - related to 359 - 21 January 2017
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Caution: This derivation is still experimental with possible errors.

Stability of a boolean function is defined as:
	Stability(f) = Expectation(f(x)*f(y))
where y is correlated version of x.

Stability of Majority is defined as (From page 120 of AnalysisOfBooleanFunctions - Chapter 5 Majority and Threshold Functions - https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~odonnell/boolean-analysis/)
	Stability(Majn) = Expectation(Majn(x)*Majn(y))
where y is correlated version of x.

For infinite n, Stability(Majn) is bounded by 2/pi*arcsin(rho). Similar stability measure can be derived for Interview TQBF threshold function also. Interview as a linear threshold function (LTF) can be defined as:
	w1*a1 + w2*a2 + ... + wn*an > threshold_cutoff
were each ai is an answer for a question qi and wi is the weightage associated with it. Berry-Esseen Central Limit Theorem applies for Interview threshold function. CLT implies that a random variable S=X1 + X2 + X3 + ... + Xn which is a sum of random variables Xi(s) converges to Gaussian Normal Distribution. Berry-Esseen CLT generalizes it to S=a1*x1 + a2*x2 + ... + an*xn where sum(ai^2) is normalized and = 1. Thus interview threshold function and Berry-Esseen CLT are structurally similar when weights wi are normalized and sum(wi^2) = 1. This implies interview scores are approximately Gaussian (Intuitively obvious because, bell curve corresponds to large proportion of voters scoring medium while tails correspond to very small percentage scoring very low and very high).

Stability of Interview can be equivalently defined as:
	Stability(Interview) = Expectation(Interview(x)*Interview(y))
where y is correlated version of x.

Substituting the threshold definition of interview in Stability:
	Stability(Interview) = Expectation((w1*a1+w2*a2+...+wn*an)*(z1*b1+z2*b2+...+zn*bn))
				= Expectation(w1*z1*a1*b1 + w1*z1*a2*b2 + ... + wn*zn*an*bn)
				= a1*b1*Expectation(w1*z1) + .... + an*bn*Expectation(wn*zn)

Assuming for all ai=bi=a:
	Stability(Interview) = a^2 * (Expectation(w1*z1) + Expectation(w1*z2) + .... + Expectation(wn*zn))

Expectation(wi*zk) = 0*0*1/4 + 0*1*1/4 + 1*0*1/4 + 1*1*1/4 for 4 possible values of (wi,zk) each with probability 1/4.

=>	Stability(Interview) = a^2 * (n^2 * 0.25) = a^2*n^2/4

	Stability(Interview) = a^2*n^2/4 < 1 => a < 2/n

If Stability(Interview) > Stability(Majority), BKS conjecture is true.

=>	a^2*n^2 / 4 > 1 - 2/pi
=>	a > 2/n * sqrt(1-2/pi)
=>	a > 1.2056205488/n [For minimum case of n=2, a > 0.6028102744]

Thus for Stability(Interview) to exceed Stability(Majority) and BKS Conjecture to be true , weight per answer has to be > 1.2056/n approximately. For minimal base case n=2, a > 0.6028.

Stability is alternatively defined as:
	(+1)*Pr(f(x) = f(y)) + (-1)*Pr(f(x) != f(y))
which is just expansion of Expectation and there are two random variables (+1 for f(x)=f(y)) and (-1 for f(x) != f(y))
=> Stability(f(x)) = 1-2*Pr(f(x) != f(y))
=> Stability(f(x)) = 1-2*Sensitivity(f(x))
=> Sensitivity(f(x)) = 0.5-0.5*Stability(f(x))

NoiseSensitivity(Interview) which is the dual of Stability is defined as:
	NoiseSensitivity(Interview) = 0.5-0.5*Stability(Interview) = 0.5-0.5*a^2*n^2/4

*) Using unicode values for ordinals with ord() and inverting with chr() causes overflow errors in SciPy/NumPy
Linear Algebra Equation solver (solve()) because evaluating polynomials for large messages creates huge numbers
*) Hence unicode has been replaced with a simple dictionaries - alphanumeric to numeric values and numeric to
alphanumeric values.
*) With above 2 dictionaries an example text message with error (garbled version of "thisissentence") is list
decoded with a window of possible values for each letter positions.
*) Logs show an approximate decoding of original message from message with error.
*) Garbled text with error was created from a previous execution of Berlekamp-Welch algorithm.

368. (THEORY) KRW Conjecture, KW relations, Majority Voting Circuit Composition - 30 January 2017 and 31 January 2017 - related to 358
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Majority Voting Circuit for P(Good) binomial series RHS is a boolean circuit composition of NC Majority voting circuit with
Voter Decision Functions for each voter variable input to Majority function defined as:
	 Maj(m) + Voter(n) = Maj(Voter1(x1,x2,...,xn),Voter2(x1,x2,...,xn),...,Voterm(x1,x2,...,xn)).  
Assumption is Voter Decision Functions can be exactly learnt in Angluin Exact Learning model i.e Voters can have zero errors. 
KRW Conjecture for boolean formula composition implies Depth(f+g) ~ Depth(f) + Depth(g) for composition f+g of two boolean formulae 
(fanout 1) f and g. Applying KRW conjecture to Maj(m) + Voter(n) Majority voting composition:
	Depth(Maj(m) + Voter(n)) ~ Depth(Maj(m)) + Depth(Voter(n))
where m is the number of voters and n is the number of variables per voter decision function.

KW relations R(f) for a function f imply Depth(f) = CommunicationComplexity(R(f)).
Karchmer-Wigderson relations for the composition are the following:
-------------
R(Maj,Voter):
-------------
	Alice: x in Inverse(Maj + Voter)(0)
	Bob:  y in Inverse(Maj + Voter)(1)
	Find xi and yi such that x != y

Depth(Maj + Voter) = CommunicationComplexity(R(Maj,Voter))
Thus Majority voting circuit composition is a KW relation.
There is an equivalent notion of Universal relation U(n) for KW relation defined as:
	Alice: x in {0,1}^(n)
	Bob:  y in {0,1}^(n)
	Find xi and yi such that x != y

Result in 368.2 prove a lowerbound:
	Depth(g+U(n)) = CommunicationComplexity(R(g,U(n))) >= log L(g) + n - O(m*logm/n) where L(g) is the formula size of g.
If g is Majority function and U(n) is individual voter decision function, depth of composition of Majority and Voter circuits is:
	D(Maj + Voter) = CommunicationComplexity(R(Maj,Voter)) >= log L(Majority) + n - O(m*logm/n)
But formula size of Majority is O(m^5.3) implying depth of Majority+VoterDecisionFunction composition is:
	D(Maj + Voter) = CommunicationComplexity(R(Maj,Voter)) >= 5.3*logm  + n - O(m*logm/n)
Thus depth of Majority voting circuit for P(Good) RHS is lowerbounded by a function of number of voters and number of variables per voter decision function.

368.1 prove a result which is an extension of 355.8:
If a class C is exactly learnable in polynomial time, DTIME(n^omega(1)) is not in C. In mistake bounded learning model, learner updates the hypothesis in each round based on mistake it makes in labelling a point on hypercube. Mistake bounded learning very closely matches human experiential learning and hence human voting error. If a class C is mistake bounded learnable in time T and mistakes M then, DTIME(n + MT) is not in C yielding a separation. Corollary: If a function in NP is polynomial time exact learnable, there is no polynomial time algorithm for NP. For unbounded number of voters(m) and variables per voter decision function(n), depth of composition is unbounded. Depth Hierarchy Theorem 368.4 immediately applies for functions computable by circuits of various depths of RHS composition. Number of variables per voter and depth of composition are linearly related while Number of voters and depth of composition are logarithmically related.

Exact Learning implies zero error on both sides of P(Good) binomial series. Assuming all boolean function are exactly learnt, a Pseudorandom choice amongst those functions yields 100% perfect choice. Quoting from 359:

	Let number of  voter decision functions with goodness xi = m(xi). Thus N = m(x1)+m(x2)+m(x3)+...+m(xn)
	Expected goodness of a PRG choice is:
		1/N * summation(xi*m(xi)) = (x1*m(x1) + x2*m(x2) + x3*m(x3) + ... + xn*m(xn)) / N
	When all voter functions have goodness 1 then PRG choice in LHS of P(good) has goodness 1.

Similarly, exact learning implies all voter decision functions are 100% perfect with zero-error in LHS. Binomial series converges to 1 on both sides. LHS is a polynomial time algorithm (because there is a PRG in P to make a choice) to RHS majority voting NP problem (assuming the exactly learnt boolean functions are in NP) implying P=NP. But from 368.1, if NP is learnable in polynomial time, NP does not have polynomial time algorithms and therefore P != NP - a contradiction. Thus polynomial time exact learning of an NP boolean function (e.g 3SAT learnt from a truth table) conflicts with P=NP and binomial series convergence.

Usual process of high level human learning vis-a-vis boolean function learning is bottom-up. Atomic concepts are learnt in leaves and complexity is built  from leaf to root by learning new concepts which are functions of subtrees. Recursive Lambda Function Growth algorithm for learning texts described earlier in this document is based on this paradigm but constructs a composition tree top-down (Mind grows lambda functions/circuits). Generalization of Recursive Lambda Function Growth is to learn a graph as opposed to trees. This is already done in Recursive Gloss Overlap special case by merging/removing isomorphic, repetitive subtrees while tree is grown top-down. This is why core number based classifier for the recursive gloss overlap graph works - repeating gloss nodes are connected to already discovered nodes by a new edge thereby converting a tree to graph top-down - Because most synset paths between words in a text go through "class label" vertices making them high degree and all such high degree vertices belong to a dense subgraph e.g k-core.


Hypothetical exact learner for 3SAT - NP voter decision functions :
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Given a truth table of size n*2^n for n variables with truth values:
	*) Find a set of binary strings, satisfying truth values 1
	*) Construct a DNF for complement of the previous set
	*) Complement the DNF to get CNF for original set

Example - For following truth table, to construct CNF for satisfying assignments {000, 001, 011, 101, 110}:
	------------------------------------------
	x1 x2 x3	truthvalue	complement
	------------------------------------------
	0  0  0		1		0
	0  0  1		1		0
	0  1  0		0		1
	0  1  1		1		0
	1  0  0		0		1
	1  0  1		1		0
	1  1  0		1		0
	1  1  1		0		1

DNF for complement set {010,100,111} is:
	!x1x2!x3 + x1!x2!x3 + x1x2x3
and the CNF learnt is complement of DNF:
	(x1 + !x2 + x3)(!x1 + x2 + x3)(!x1 + !x2 + !x3)
with satisfying assignments {000, 001, 011, 101, 110}

This exact learner requires O(2^n) time which is exponential in number of variables.

368.6 describes an algorithm (CDNF) to learn any boolean functions in time polynomial in number of variables,its DNF size and CNF size. This together with 368.1 implies a polynomial time learning algorithm for NP and existence of polynomial time learning algorithm for NP(3CNF) indicates NP does not have polynomial time algorithms (and Expoential Time Hypothesis could be true). This coincides with evidences towards divergence of P(Good) series and superpolynomial size circuits for 3SAT implied in 53.16, 256, 265, 275, 318 (Majority Lemma for Hardness Amplification) and 355. This is a serious contradiction - exact learning derandomizes both sides of P(Good) circuit. LHS non-majority social choice is zero-error and equals 1 while RHS if NP also converges to 1 and implies a polynomial time algorithm for NP while exact learning forbids polynomial time algorithm for NP. Resolving this impasse amounts to defining what is meant by exactness and zero-error in voting decision and social choice (Perfection commonsensically enshrines zero-error decision making for unbounded number of scenarios i.e variables while exact learning assumes bounded set of variables)

370. (THEORY) Majority Boolean Function, Sensitivity, Roth's estimate and 2-Coloring/Complement Functions of Sequences -
1 February 2017 - related to 24,338 - Important draft updates to https://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.4102v1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boolean Majority Function finds the majority binary value of input binary string of length n. Any binary string of length n can be
considered as 2-coloring of bit position integers with corresponding complement functions for each color: f(x) is for 1s colored red and
g(x) is for 0s colored blue. For example, 1001011 is a 2-colored sequence with red (1) in bit positions 1,4,6,7 and blue (0) in bit positions
2,3,5. Complement functions for this bit position binary coloring are defined as:
	f(1)=1
	f(2)=4
	f(3)=6
	f(4)=7
and
	g(1)=2
	g(2)=3
	g(3)=5
Natually, arithmetic progressions and monochromatic arithmetic progressions on these bit positions can be defined. Discrepancy is the
 difference between number of colored integers in an arithmetic progression. Roth's estimate which is the minimum(maximum(discrepancy))
for all possible colorings (i.e all possible binary strings) is >= N^(1/4+epsilon). For majority function 2-coloring, this estimate is
the difference between number of 0s and 1s in the input to majority function with probability equal to natural density of min(max()) arithmetic progression.  If majority function outputs 1, |f(x)| > |g(x)| and if 0, |g(x)| > |f(x)|. From this an approximate estimate of number of 1s and 0s in majority function input can be obtained (with probability equal to natural density):
	|f(x)| = number of 1s = [N + N^(1/4+epsilon)]/2  if majority function outputs 1
	|g(x)| = number of 0s = [N - N^(1/4+epsilon)]/2  if majority function outputs 1
and vice versa if majority function outputs 0. For previous example, majority is 1 and :
	|f(x)| = number of 1s = [7 + 7^0.25]/2 = 4.313288 ~ 4
	|g(x)| = number of 0s = [7 - 7^0.25]/2 = 2.6867 ~ 3
Sensitivity of Majority function is number of bits to be flipped to change the outcome which is nothing but the discrepancy (|f(x)| - |g(x)|) wth probability equal to natural density and is lowerbounded by Roth's estimate. Formally, Sensitivity(Majority) > N^(1/4+epsilon). An important special case is when input to majority is a binary string 2-colored by prime-composite complement functions in bit positions i.e prime bit positions are 1 and composite bit positions are 0 and majority function outputs 0 or 1 (Approximate number of primes less than N = pi(N) ~ N/logN from Prime Number Theorem).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solves CNFSAT by a Polynomial Time Approximation scheme:
       - Encode each clause as a linear equation in n variables: missing variables and negated variables are 0, others are 1
       - Solve previous system of equations by least squares algorithm to fit a line
       - Variable value above 0.5 is set to 1 and less than 0.5 is set to 0
       - Rounded of assignment array satisfies the CNFSAT with high probability
Essentially each CNF is represented as a matrix A and solved by AX=B where X is the column vector of variables and B is identity column vector

376. (THEORY and FEATURE-DONE) Approximate SAT solver update - 8 February 2017 - related to 373
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Updated CNFSATSolver.py to create set of random 3CNFs and verify if the least squares assignment is satisfied. Presently it creates randomly concatenated CNFs of 10 variables and 10 clauses in an infinite loop and prints a percentage of satisfied 3CNFs so far by least square heuristic. Logs for this percentage after few hundred iterations has been committed to testlogs/. It shows an intriguing convergence at 80% (i.e 80% of 3CNFs are satisfied) after few hundred iterations of random CNFs. A caveat has to be mentioned here on hardness of approximation and PCP theorem: MaxSAT and Clique do not have Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme unless P=NP. PTAS usually creates a solution within 1+/-epsilon distance from optimal. MaxSAT problem tries to maximize number of clauses satisified in a CNF. But this least square SAT solver is exact SAT solver and the percentage of 80% found in testlogs/ implies 80% of CNFs were satisfied. This could heuristically imply 80% of clauses per CNF were satisfied on the average. Though this percentage is specific to 10 clauses * 10 variables, similar asymptotic convergence to ~79% was observed for 5 clauses * 5 variables. Assuming this implies epsilon to be 0.2 in general (average 20% distance from optimal for all CNFs), could imply a PTAS (because solving system of equations by Least Squares or Gaussian Elimination is polynomial in number of clauses) for MaxSAT which satisfies 80% clauses per CNF on average and P=NP.(Related: Unique Games Conjecture)

379. (THEORY) Machine Translation, Recursive Gloss Overlap Graphs in different Natural Languages and Graph Homomorphisms - 13 February 2017
- related to 178
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Machine Translation is equivalent to graph homomorphism between 2 recursive gloss overlap graphs of a text in 2 natural languages where
homomorphism f for translation is defined as:
	if (u,v) is in E(G1) then (f(u),f(v)) is in E(G2)
for recursive gloss overlap graphs G1 and G2 for languages L1 (e.g. English) and L2 (e.g Tamizh) constructed from respective ontologies.
In previous definition, u and v are two words in natural language L1 and f(u) and f(v) are two words in natural language L2.
This relaxes the isomorphism requirement mentioned in 178. Set of all digraphs G such that there is a homomorphism from G to a graph H is
denoted by L(H). Guessing the set of digraphs G for a digraph H implies finding set of all translations for a text from a set of natural
languages to another natural language. This guessing problem is known by Dichotomy Conjecture to be either in P or NP-Complete.

381. (FEATURE-DONE) Java Spark Streaming with NetCat WebServer update and some analysis on HiveServer2+Spark Integration - 18 February 2017
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*) Rewrote SparkGenericStreaming.java mapreduce functions with Spark 2.1.0 + Java 8 lambda functions
*) Enabled Netcat Socket streaming boolean flag instead of URL socket with Jsoup
*) With above changes (and no HiveServer2), socket streaming receiver works and Hive saveAsTable()/Parquet file saving works.
*) HiveServer2 was enabled in Spark Conf by adding hive-site.xml in spark/conf directory. (Two example hive-site.xml(s) have been
committed to repository.)
*) Spark 2.1.0 was started with hive-site.xml to connect to HiveServer2 2.1.1. This resulted in 2 out of heapspace errors as documented
in testlogs/ with exception "Error in instantiating HiveSessionState".
*) Such OOM errors with HiveServer2 and Spark have been reported earlier in Apache JIRA. Instead of TTransport, FrameTransport was also
tried which caused "Frame size exceeds maximum frame size" errors. SASL was also disabled in hive-site.xml.
*) Reason for such OOM errors in HiveServer2 seems to be heavy memory footprint of HiveServer2 and Spark together and CPU usage reaches 100%
for both cores. Might require a high-end server with large RAM size so that heapspace is set to atleast 8GB. HiveServer2 is known to be
memory intensive application. Also Spark only supports Hive 1.2.1 and not Hive 2.1.1 which could be the reason.
*) Increasing Java Heap space in spark config file (spark.executor.memory and spark.driver.memory) also did not have effect.
*) Setting HADOOP_HEAPSIZE also did not have effect. OOM error occurs while instantiating HiveSessionState and bootstrapping Hive databases
(get_all_databases). Isolated beeline CLI connection works though with HiveServer2.
*) Hence presently Spark Streaming works with Spark provided metastore_db Hive Support and Parquet file support.
*) testlogs/ have stream processing logs for NetCat (NC) webserver.

383. (THEORY) Recursive Gloss Overlap Graphs, Intrinsic Merit and Korner Graph Entropy - related to 348 - 22 February 2017
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Graph representation of text and deriving a quantitative intrinsic merit from recursive gloss overlap definition graph by projecting
WordNet onto the document has been described previously. Spectral Graph Theory qualitatively analyzes the graph in terms of eigenvalues of
its Laplacian. Quantitative Graph Theory provides various statistical tools to quantify a graph in terms of its complexity. Measuring
meaningfulness of a text has been translated to the problem finding easy paths between concepts and keywords in the text. This is computational linguistic Symbol Grounding problem of learning from dictionary definitions (refer 216.3). Korner's Graph Entropy defines the entropy of a
graph G as follows:
		KE(G) = minimum(I(X,Y))
where X is a randomly chosen vertex in V(G) and Y is an independent set of G (set of vertices with no edges between them). I(X,Y) is the
probabilistic mutual information of two random variable X and Y defined as:
		I(X,Y) = double_summation(p(x,y)log(p(x,y)/p(x)p(y)))
where p(x) is probability of X=x, p(y) is probability of Y=y and p(x,y) is a joint probability distribution of X=x and Y=y.

An alternative definition of Korner Entropy of a graph G is :
		KE(G) = minimum [- sum_v_in_V(G) {1/|V(G)| * log(Pr[v in Y])}]
i.e minimum of summations over product of probability of a randomly chosen vertex v in V(G) and log likelihood probability of v in an independent set Y of G.

Mutual information is the generalization of Shannon information entropy when two dependent random variables are involved. Korner's entropy quantitatively captures the complexity and merit of a graph representation of text quite effectively because mutual information is the amount of knowledge one random variable has about the other. This is quite useful for text meaningfulness - two words with high mutual information are quite likely to be closely related. More precisely, from definitions of Korner Entropy, mutual information of a word vertex and an independent set of word vertices in recursive gloss overlap graph is the "extent of relatedness" between a word and an independent set of words it is part of. When a word is in an independent set of word vertices, there exists no relation among them - no word vertex is in dictionary gloss definition of other word vertices. By summing up log likelihoods for all such vertices, a measure of "meaninglessness" is obtained. Dual of this meaninglessness is meaningfulness (document ranking by meaninglessness is inversion of ranking by meaningfulness) obtained by (-) sign and minimum(). Maximum Korner Entropy is log(|V|) for complete graphs and minimum is zero for empty graphs. Any document graph would have entropy merit value between 0 and log|V|. Computing Korner Entropy is NP-hard since finding stable independent sets is NP-hard.

Quoted excepts: "...When the network is very sparse, graph energy E will be monotonically increasing with k. With slow increase of intensity, energy E will be still proportional to k but with appearing of some weak fluctuations. However, while the network is becoming highly dense, the graph energy will drop sharply. And the value of k that corresponds to the largest graph energy is about 0.8N...". This threshold relation between average degree and energy of graph has parallels to Bianconi-Barabasi least energy intrinsic fitness which implies low energy vertices attract large number of links. Similarly, Graph Energy which is cumulative estimate for all vertices, decreases when the graph has lot of edges which is possible only if average degree of the vertices is high. High average degree by Bianconi-Barabasi model implies least energy and high intrinsic fitness.

384. (THEORY) Neural Tensor Networks Reasoning and Recursive Gloss Overlap merit scoring - 23 February 2017
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Neural Tensor Networks described in 384.1 generalizes a linear neuron into a multidimensional tensor and assigns a score for relation
between two entities e1 and e2. This is described in the context of an ontology (e.g WordNet) where a relation between two words w1 and w2
is assigned a score based on various distance measures. Recursive Gloss Overlap graph which is a gloss definition graph has a single relation
between any two words - w1 "is in dictionary/gloss definition of" w2. Present implementation does not quantify the extent of relatedness
between two words connected by an edge in Recursive Gloss Overlap graph. This definition graph can be considered as a Neural Tensor Network
and each edge can be scored as a neural tensor relation between two word vertices. Cumulative sum total score of all edges in this graph is a
quantitative intrinsic merit measure of the meaningfulness and intrinsic merit. Thus any document's definition graph is a set of tensor neurons which together decide the merit of the text. Together with Korner Entropy complexity measure, Sum of Tensor Neuron scores effectively weight the text.

385. (THEORY) Recursive Lambda Function Growth, Random Walks on Recursive Gloss Overlap graph and Text Comprehension - 25 February 2017 - related to 46, 47, 216, 230 and 384
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As mentioned in previous section, two word vertices x1 and x2 are connected by an edge weight determined by tensor neuron (x1 R x2) for some relation R. Human comprehension of text can be approximated by set of compositional lambda functions created from converging random walks or DFS Tree on the recursive gloss overlap graph. For example, following definition graph for a text "Flight landed on runway because
of fuel shortage" is created from thesaurus/sdictionary/gloss definitions of an ontology:

			flight -------> tyre ------> wheel ---> runway
			  ^				|
		          |				V
			  |			     landing
			fuel -----> shortage		|
							V
						       gear

Example Random walks on previous graph:
---------------------------------------
			flight ---> tyre ----> wheel ---> landing ---> gear
			flight ----> fuel ----> shortage
If Tensor Neurons are applied for each edge, this graph is a weighted directed graph where weight is determined by Tensor Neuron. If each relation is a lambda function following the Recursive Lambda Function Compositional Growth defined in 216, every random walk can be mapped to a lambda function composition tree. For example, following random walk:

			fuel ----> flight ---> tyre ----> wheel ---> landing ---> gear

is tensor neuron labelled with lambda functions:

			fuel --(requiredby)---> flight----(has)---> tyre ---(has)---> wheel ---(does) ---> landing ---(requires)---> gear

where lambda functions for each edge with word vertices as parameters are:
	f1 = requiredby(fuel, flight)
	f2 = has(flight, tyre)
	f3 = has(tyre, wheel)
	f4 = does(wheel, landing)
	f5 = requires(landing, gear)

Composition is done left associative creating following tree recursively:
	f5(landing,gear)
	f4(wheel, f5(landing, gear))
	f3(tyre, f4(wheel, f5(landing, gear)))
	f2(flight, f3(has, f4(wheel, f5(landing, gear))))
	f1(fuel, f2(flight, f3(tyre, f4(wheel, f5(landing, gear)))))

Previous composition tree is done for each Markov Chain Random Walk on the Definition Graph. Difference between composition in 216 and previous is: Recursive Lambda Function Compositional Growth is done on a flat sentence in 216, while it is applied to a random walk on definition graph here. Because neuron tensors are equivalent to a lambda function per edge, each function fi can be made to return a relevance merit score which is fed to next layer - in essence each random walk lambda function composition tree is a multilayer tensor neuron. Similar process can be applied to paths in a DFS tree also. Inorder traversal of the composition tree yields an equivalent expanded text of original text (In above example it is "fuel requiredby flight has tyre has wheel does landing requires gear") . Each random walk results in a tree-structured multilayer tensor neuron. Equivalently, each lambda function tensor could return a pictorial meaning and each composition "operates" on the tensor arguments to return a new animated version to next level up the tree (i.e meaning is represented as visuals). Ontology required for this is an ImageNet than a WordNet.

Advantage of Random Walks is it mimicks the randomness of deep learning in human text comprehension. Typical visual comprehension reads a passage atleast once scanning the keywords and inferring grammatical connectives between keywords. After keywords are known, they have to be related to infer meaning. An ontology provides paths between keywords and how they are related. After all edges and paths are known, collective meaning has to be evaluated by traversing the graph. Meaning is accrued over time by traversing the relations between keywords compositionally. This traversal is a random walk on the definition graph. Previous lambda function growth for each random walk on graph builds meaning recursively. Covering time of random walk is the number of steps required to visit all vertices. Mixing time of random walk is the number of steps required to reach stationary distribution (i.e any further random walk is no different from previous walks). These two measures have been widely studied for weighted directed graphs and are good estimators of time required to deep-learn and comprehend a text. Trivial DFS search is quite static and stationary distribution in Mixing time of random walk is the state when a text has been fully understood and any further reading does not add more meaning. Mixing time in undirected graph is proportional to Isoperimetric number or Cheeger's constant. Isoperimetry measures amount of bottleneck in a graph. For directed weighted graph, Conductance is the equivalent isoperimetric measure. When isoperimetry is high, random walk converges quickly implying faster text comprehension.  For a partition of the vertex set of a graph (S, T), conductance of the cut Φ(S,T) = u ∈ S,v ∈ T sum(a(u,v)) / minimum (sum(w ∈ S dw), sum(w ∈ T dw)) where dw = for all (w,z) sum(a(w,z)) and a(s,t) is the weight of an edge i.e tensor neuron lambda function score. PageRank of the Recusive Gloss Overlap graph is converging random walk - PageRank along with Core Number of definition graph is already known to classify texts in unsupervised setting by ranking the vertices.

390. (THEORY) Prime-Composite Complementation/2-coloring, Riemann Zeta Function and Sum of Eigenvalues - Elementary Analysis - 6 March 2017
- related to 19, 24, 319, 323, 338, 370
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Special case of complementation/2-coloring is prime-composite coloring where set of natural numbers is 2-colored as primes and composites.
Here terminology of complementation and 2-coloring is used interchangeably. But complementation is a generic notion for functions over
reals too. Riemann Zeta Function and truth of Riemann Hypothesis imply a pattern in distribution of primes and hence pattern in prime-composite
coloring. Thus Riemann Zeta Function is a 2-coloring scheme for set of natural numbers.

Let q^s + q^(1-s) = v be an eigenvalue of a graph where s is a complex exponent (s=a+ib). It can be written as:
	q^2s + q = vq^s
	q^2(a+ib) + q = vq^(a+ib)
	q^2a*q^2ib + q = vq^a*q^ib
	q^2a(e^i2blogq) + q = vq^a[e^iblogq] by rewriting q^ib = e^iblogq
	q^2a[cos(2blogq) + isin(2blogq)] + q = vq^a[cos(blogq) + isin(blogq)]
Equating Re() and Im():
	q^2a[cos(2blogq)] + q = vq^a[cos(blogq)]
	q^2a[sin(2blogq)] = vq^a[sin(blogq)]
Ratio of Re() and Im() on both sides:
	q^2a[sin(2blogq)] 		 vq^a[sin(blogq)]
     --------------------------  =      ------------------
	q^2a[cos(2blogq)] + q 		 vq^a[cos(blogq)]

   q^2a[2*sin(blogq)*cos(blogq)] 		[sin(blogq)]
     --------------------------  = 	     ------------------
	q^2a[cos(2blogq)] + q 	 		[cos(blogq)]

	q^2a[2*cos(blogq)*cos(blogq)] =   q^2a[cos(2blogq)] + q

	q^2a[2*cos(blogq)*cos(blogq)] =   q^2a[cos(blogq)*cos(blogq) - sin(blogq)*sin(blogq)] + q

	q^2a[cos(blogq)*cos(blogq) + sin(blogq)*sin(blogq)] = q

	q^2a = q => a = 0.5

When s=0.5 with no imaginary part and q+1 is regularity of a graph, v = 2*sqrt(q) and corresponding graph is a q+1 regular Ramanujan Graph.

Let H = {G1,G2,G3,...} be an infinite set of graphs with eigenvalues 1^s + 1^(1-s), 2^s + 2^(1-s), 3^s + 3^(1-s),....

Sum of these eigenvalues for infinite set of graphs has following relation to Riemann Zeta Function for s=w+1:
Sum_q=1_to_inf(q^s + q^(1-s)) = [1 + 1/2^w + 1/3^w + ...] + [1 + 2^(w+1) + 3^(w+1) + ...] = RiemannZetaFunction + [1 + 2^(w+1) + 3^(w+1) + ...]

Sum_q=1_to_inf(q^s + q^(1-s)) -  [1 + 2^(w+1) + 3^(w+1) + ...] = RiemannZetaFunction

Thus Riemann Zeta Function is written as difference of sum of eigenvalues for an infinite set of graphs and another infinite exponential series.
Hermitian Real Symmetric matrices have real eigenvalues which is true for undirected graphs. For directed graphs, eigenvalues are complex numbers. Because of this condition, elements of set H have to be directed graphs. Relation between eigenvalues of two matrices M1 and M2 and eigenvalues of their sum M1+M2 is expressed by [Weyl] inequalities and [Knutson-Tao] proof of Horn's conjecture. Sum of eigenvalues of M1+M2 is equal to sum of eigen values of M1 + sum of eigen values of M2 (Trace=sum of eigen values=sum of diagonal elements). The set H has one-to-one mapping with set of natural numbers and is 2-colored as prime and composite graphs based on index (each graph is monochromatic). Sum of adjacency matrices of H is also a directed graph (if all Gi have same number of vertices) denoted as G(H).

does not work well with BackPropagation of MaxPooling in Convolution Network. Instead multiples of a small fraction makes the
MaxPooling layer quite receptive to changes in image pixel values.

394. (THEORY) Coloring Real Numbers and Complement Functions - 8 March 2017 - related to 323, 338
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So far equivalence of 2-coloring schemes and integer valued complement functions have been mentioned. Most generic problem in this class
is to find coloring schemes (or) functions which "complement" real and complex n-dimensional surfaces(i.e sets of values of a function f and
its complement g create a disjoint set cover of the real/complex planes). Ramsey theory pertains to coloring integer sequences. 394.1 defines
the problem of coloring the real line as minimum number of colors required to color the real line such that no two points within some specific distance (which in turn is an element of a distance set) are of same color. In Graph theory terms, this reduces to chromatic number of a
graph where two vertices a and b are adjacent iff distance between a and b on real line is in distance set. This is stricter requirement
of coloring compared to complementation and complement graphs representation mentioned in 338. For example, following complementation of [1,2]:
	f(0) = [1.0,1.11]
		g(0) = [1.12,1.23]
	f(1) = [1.24,1.30]
		g(1) = [1.31,1.68]
	f(2) = [1.69,2.0]
has colored regions of length [0.11,0.11,0.06,0.37,0.31] and can be 2-colored with f and g. If the distance set is {0.01,0.02} two
points 1.32 and 1.33 are 0.01 apart but have same color (belong to same function g). Similarly points 1.69 and 1.71 are 0.02 apart but
have same color f. Thus complementation over reals relaxes the coloring conditions significantly. Coloring real line is a special case of
complementation with distance set requirement while Coloring integers is equivalent to complementation. Rather, distance set for real
complementation is of size 1 containing length of largest monochromatic streak - in previous example it is {0.37}.

*) This commit rewrites the Recursive Lambda Function Growth implementation by adding a new lambda function growth
function.
*) This new function creates a definition graph with Recursive Gloss Overlap algorithm from a text and computes all pairs shortest paths in the graph
*) For each such shortest path edges, an AVL lambda function composition balanced tree is grown (i.e every path is a lambda function composition tree).
*) Tensor Neuron Lambda Function is computed for each subtree root by following relation evaluated on a stack:
                function(operand1, operand2)
where operand1, operand2 and function are successively popped from AVL composition tree stack representation
*) Tensor Neuron triplet (operand1, function, operand2) is evaluated presently as maximum Wu-Palmer similarity of Synsets for cartesian product of operand1 and operand2. But it can be augmented with any arbitrary weighting scheme. Cartesian product of Synsets for 2 entities is the simplest 2-dimensional tensor neuron.

*) Implemented  Korner Entropy intrinsic merit for Recursive Gloss Overlap graph.
*) function korner_entropy() finds maximal independent sets for all vertices and chooses the minimum entropy such that a vertex is in a maximal independent set.
*) Logs for this have been committed to testlogs/

Previous two intrinsic merit measures - tensor neuron network and korner entropy - sufficiently quantify the complexity of a document's inner purport. Neuron Tensors transform the ontology subgraph of a text into a new kind of multilayered graph perceptron. Infact it generalizes traditional multilayered trellis perceptrons for which backpropagation is applied to find weights per activation edge. There is no known backpropagation algorithm for generic graph of perceptrons. Neuron Tensors per word-word edge are equated to a lambda function and compositional tree of these neurons for any walk on the text-graph is an alternative deep learning technique to backpropagation. Korner Entropy is a measure of disconnectedness (total probability of vertices in independent sets). Presently all pairs shortest paths is used in place of random walks - set of all pairwise path tensor neuron lambda compositions is an upperbound on set of all random walks.

399. (USECASE) NeuronRain Usecases - Software (Log) Analytics and VIRGO kernel_analytics config - 16 March 2017
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Software Analytics Deep Learning implementation in python-src/software_analytics/ sources its input variables - CPU%, Memory%, TimeDuration% for a process from logs. VIRGO kernel_analytics module reads machine learnt config variables from kernel_analytics.conf and exports them kernelwide. An example single layer perceptron usecase is:

	If the CPU% is > 75% and Memory% > 75% and TimeDuration% > 75% then
		do a kernelwide	overload signal
	else
		do nothing

Sigmoid function for this usecase is:
	sigma(4/9 * x1 + 4/9 * x2 + 4/9 * x3) where x1 = CPU%, x2 = Memory% and x3 = TimeDuration%
which is 1 when all variables reach 75%.

Spark Streaming Log Analyzer ETLs htop data to .parquet files and Software Analytics code reads it, deep-learns above neural network and writes a key-value variable OverloadSignal=1 to VIRGO kernel_analytics.conf. VIRGO kernel_analytics driver reads it and exports a kernelwide variable kernel_overload=1. Any interested kernel driver takes suitable action based on it (automatic shutdown, reboot, quiesce intensive applications etc.,)

An inverse of this usecase is to find the weights for x1,x2,x3 when system crashes. This requires a gradient descent or backpropagation with multilayered perceptron.

400. (THEORY) Mechanism Design, Condorcet Jury Theorem, Derandomization, Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem and Designing a Voting Mechanism
- 27 March 2017 , 30 March 2017, 31 March 2017, 18 April 2017 - related to 368 and all other P(Good) circuit related sections
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem prevents any Social Choice Function defined on atleast 3 elements from being non-dictatorial. Mechanism Design is the reverse game theory which tries to circumvent this limitation and designs a mechanism for required result for social goodness. With respect to P(Good) series and circuit, design of a voting mechanism for arbitrary number of voters which overcomes limitation of Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem would imply convergence of P(Good) series. This is related to exact learning of boolean social choice functions with zero-error in 368.6. Open question: Does exact learning of a voter decision function imply a voting mechanism design?

A simple example of strategic/tactical voting and Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem is given in http://rangevoting.org/IncentToExagg.html. Here by changing the ranking preferences (i.e voter switch loyalties by manipulation, tactical and strategic voting, bribery, bounded rationality and erroneous decision etc.,) result of an election with atleast 3 candidates can be changed. Thus majority voting is vulnerable to error. Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem applies to all voting systems including secret ballot because even discreet voter can be psychologically influenced to change stance against inherent desire.

This implies for more than 3 candidates, RHS of P(Good) series for majority voting can never converge because there is always a non-zero error either by bounded rationality or manipulation. By pigeonhole principle either some or all of voters contributing to the P(Good) summation must have decided incorrectly or manipulated with non-zero probability. But this requires voter decision function (i.e social choice function) to be non-boolean (Candidates are indexed as 0,1,2,...). Exact learning of boolean functions applies to only 2 candidates setting where candidates are indexed as 0 and 1. Also, LHS of P(Good) series which is a (or quite close to a dictatorship by Friedgut-Kalai-Nisan quantitative version of Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem) dictatorship social choice function, would be strategyproof (resilient to error and manipulative voting) and thus may have greater goodness probability (which is a conditional probability on chosen one's goodness) than RHS in more than 3 candidates setting.

Condorcet Jury Theorem mentioned in references below, is exactly the P(Good) binomial series summation and has been studied in political science and social choice theory. This theorem implies majority decision is better and its goodness probability tends to 1 than individual decision if probability of correct decision making for each voter is > 0.5. In the opposite case majority decision goodness worsens if individual decision goodness probability is < 0.5. Thus majority voting is both good and bad depending on individual voter decision correctness. In terms of BP* complexity definitions, if each voter has a BP* social choice function (boolean or non-boolean) with p > 0.5, accuracy of majority voting tends to 100% correctness i.e Composition Majn(BPX1, BPX2,...) for some complexity class BPXi for each voter implying derandomization (this also implies BPX=X if Majn(BPX1,BPX2,...) composition is in BPX). Proof of BPP != P would imply there is atleast one voter with p < 0.5. Condorcet theorem ignores dependency and unequal error scenarios but still holds good by central limit theorem (because each voter decision is a random variable +1 or -1 and sum of these random variables for all voters tends to gaussian by CLT) and law of large numbers.

Corollary: From 129 and 368, depth of Majority voting circuit composition can be unbounded and if all voter social choice functions have same number of variables and number of voters is exponential in number of variables, Majority voting circuit composition with error is in BPEXP than PH. By Condorcet Jury Theorem, if all voters tending to infinity decide correctly with probability > 0.5, then BPEXP derandomizes to EXP => BPEXP=EXP. Non-boolean social choice functions for more than 2 candidates are usually preference profiles per voter (list of ranked candidates per voter) and topranked candidate is voted for by the voter.

If Majority Voting Circuit is in BPP, which is quite possible if number of voters is polynomial in number of variables and circuit is of polynomial size and because from Adleman's Theorem (and Bennet-Gill Theorem), BPP is in P/poly, BPP derandomizes to P for infinite electorate with decision correctness probability > 0.5 for all voters. Thus homogeneous electorate of high decision correctness (> 0.5) implies both BPEXP=EXP and P=BPP.

Locality Sensitive Hashing accumulates similar voters in a bucket chain. The social choice function is the distance function. Circuit/Algorithm for Multiway contest social choice (generalization of Majority boolean function) is:
	*) Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) for clustering similar voters who vote for same candidate
	*) Sorting the LSH and find the maximum size cluster (bucket chain)

Maj(N,G) for a random graph G with probability of edge being p = True of G has atleast N/2 = |V|*(|V| - 1)/4 edges. Majority voting can be defined as a random graph with each voter being an edge with decision correctness probability p i.e Probability of Existence of an edge increases with correctness of decision by voter. Margulis-Russo formula describes the sharp threshold phenomenon for boolean functions and rate of change of P(Maj(G))=1 with respect to p, specifically for majority boolean function. Thus it is an alternative spectacle to view P(Good) majority voting binomial coefficient summation and Condorcet Jury Theorem. For majority function, sharp threshold occurs at p >= 0.5.

*) It is a derivative of LSH based similarity clustering implemented in python-src/LocalitySensitiveHashing.py
*) It has to be mentioned here that ThoughtNet is also an inverted index for documents with additional features (i.e it is
classifier based than raw string similarity)
*) LSHIndex uses Redis Distributed Key Value Persistent Store as hashtable backend to store index.
*) LSHIndex is not string to text inverted index, but hashed string to text inverted index (something like a digital fingerprint)
*) Presently two types of hashes exist: primitive ordinal and MD5 hash
*) Only one hash table is implemented on Redis with multiple hash functions with random choice.
*) Presently 50 hash functions with 50 entries hash index has been implemented.

404. (THEORY) Indexless Web Search, World Wide Web Graph Property Testing, On-demand Indexing - related to 403 - 9 April 2017
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Almost all known web search engines rely on a pre-built index created from already crawled WWW graph. Is a pre-built index necessary for
web search? Can the small world property of world wide web graph (i.e property of graph such that easy short paths exist between any pairs
of vertices as proved in Stanley Milgram experiment, Kleinberg Lattice), be applied to find a url matching a search query starting from any
vertex? Facebook graph has almost a billion user vertices and on an average any person is connected to any other within 3.74 path lengths.
Can this be generalized to world wide web? Traditional book index maps word queries to pages having the words. If entire book is translated
into a huge definition graph by Recursive Gloss Overlap graph, then instead of looking-up index, starting at a random word vertex, any other
word should be easily reachable if graph has small world property. This realworld problem is already studied as Graph Property Testing which are algorithms to test if a graph has specific property(clique, colorability, edge and vertex queries etc.,). Hyperball indexless crawler in NeuronRain AsFer is an effort in this line of thought. Such an indexless crawler can "learn" an index online by repeated queries and build an index from cached results at runtime. Index is not prebuilt but grown ondemand. Assuming internet has such small world degrees of freedom upperbounded by a constant, any query is constant time serviceable in average case complexity.

408. (THEORY) Condorcet Jury Theorem, Collaborative Filtering, Epistemological Democracy, Network Voting in WWW Link Graph,
Majority Function and Correctness of Majority Vote Ranking - 16 May 2017, 23 May 2017
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let v1, v2 be two vertices being good and bad choices respectively. In link graph all incoming edges to a vertex v1 are
votes for that vertex. From Condorcet Jury Theorem if all incoming links occur with probability p > 0.5, then probability that v1 is chosen tends to 1 for large indegree. For 2 candidates c1, c2 and voters v1, v2, v3, ... vn, edges (votes) to c1 occur with probability p and edges(votes) to v2 occur with probability 1-p. Thus voting graph is a random bipartite graph and can be generalized to multiple candidates. Candidates Vertex set C={c1, c2, ...,cn} can have more than one indegree and zero outdegree. Voters Vertex set V={v1, v2, ..., vn} can have only one outdegree and zero indegree. If C intersection V != emptyset, then graph is general directed graph and can have cycles. Each voter vertex vy either votes to some other vertex vx or receives vote from vx. vy votes for vx with probability p. vy votes for vertices other than vx with cumulative probability 1-p. Vertices voted by vy are ranked by goodness (i.e goodness(vx) > goodness(others)). If vy votes for vx then vy decides with decision correctness probability p.

More generically, vertex vx receives votes from vertices vy2,vy2,vy3,...,vyn with decision correctness probability p. Vertices vy1,vy2,vy3,...,vyn vote for vertices other than vx with decision correctness probability 1-p. Each vertex in WWW link graph has this 2 level tree structure with varying probability pi. From Condorcet Jury Theorem, hyperlinks to vx from vy1,vy2,...,vyn  are 100% correct group decision if p > 0.5. Equal p for all votes to a vertex is the homogeneous voter assumption of Condorcet Jury Theorem. If the vertices are ranked by some algorithm (HITS Hub-Authority, PageRank etc.,) then correctness of rank is measured by Condorcet Jury Theorem. It is apt to mention here that probability p is different from weights of directed graph edges in PageRank Markov Random Walk iteration (where weight of outgoing edge/vote is decided by the ratio 1/outdegree) in the sense that: 1/outdegree is the static percentage of vote to an adjacent vertex in a non-random graph while p in network voting is a dynamic measure for decision correctness of a vote to a vertex in a random graph. For heterogeneous voter assumption, more recent theorems which generalize Condorcet Jury Theorem are required.

Collaborative Filtering in Recommender Systems is the most generalized way of Majority Voting where a matrix of users to their preferences for items is used as a training data for a new user to recommend an item. For example, if 9 out of 10 users up vote an item, 11th user is recommended that item and viceversa for down votes. Above analysis is an alternative direction for defining value judgement correctness already discussed in references 408.1 and 408.2. Correlated Votes and their effects on Condorcet Jury Theorem are analyzed by [KrishnaLadha].

410. (THEORY) Objective and Subjective Value Judgement, Text Ranking and Condorcet Jury Theorem - 29 May 2017 and 4 June 2017 - Related to 202, 384, 385 and all Recursive Lambda Function Growth and Recursive Gloss Overlap algorithms sections in this document
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Objective merit or Intrinsic merit of a document is the measure of meaningfulness or information contained in a document. Subjective merit is how the document is perceived - Reality Versus Perception - Both should ideally coincide but do not.

Following are few real-world examples in addition to academic credentials example in 202:
*) Soccer player, Cricket player or a Tennis player is measured intrinsically by number of goals scored, number of runs/wickets or number of grandslams won respectively and not subjectively by extent of votes or fan following to them (incoming edges). Here reality and perception coincide often and an intrinsically best player by records is also most revered. Any deviation is because of human prejudice. Here intrinsic merit precedes social prestige.
*) Merits of students are judged by examinations (question-answering) and not by majority voting by faculty. Thus question-answering or interview is an algorithm to measure intrinsic merit objectively. Here again best student in terms of marks or grades is also the most favoured. Any deviation is human prejudice. Interview of a document is how relevant it is to a query measured by graph edit distance between recursive gloss overlap graphs of query and text. Here also intrinsic merit precedes social prestige.

Present ranking algorithms are mostly majority voting (perception) oriented which is just half truth. Other half is the reality and there are no known algorithms to objectively judge documents.  Recursive Lambda Function Growth algorithm and its specialization Recursive Gloss Overlap graph are objective intrinsic merit algorithms filling this void and try to map above real-life examples to text document ranking.

But how to measure "number of goals etc.," of a document vis-a-vis the rest? This is where Computational Linguistic Text-to-Graph analysis fits in. Graph representation of a document with various quantitative and qualitative graph complexity measures differentiates and grades the texts by intrinsic complexity. This combines two fields: Computational Linguistics which is founded on Psychoanalysis and Graph Theory. Former pertains to mental picture created by reading a document and latter is how complex that picture is. Recursive Lambda Function Growth envisages an ImageNet which is a graph of related images of entities to create an animated movie representation of a text stored as a subgraph of ImageNet. ImageNet (pictorial WordNet) is not yet available.

Condorcet Jury Theorem formalizes above intuition and bridges two worlds - objective reality and subjective perception. A best performing student by objective examination/interview assessment is also the most voted by infinite faculty if correctness of decision > 0.5 for all faculty voters i.e. Objective Intrinsic Merit = Subjective Perception based Majority Voting Merit.

Crucial Observation is: Merit creates Centrality (Social prestige) and not the opposite - Prestige can not create merit but can only be a measure of merit. Otherwise this is an anachronism - merit does not exist yet but prestige exists and thus prestige preceding merit.

Alternatively, interview of document is simply the rank of the document in terms of intrinsic graph complexity merit of it versus the rest of the text documents. Thus there are 2 aspects of interview:
*) Ranking text document by intrinsic graph complexity/entropy merit
*) Relevance of the text to a query - graph edit distance

Here again another question can be raised: Why is a graph representation of text an apt objective intrinsic merit measure? Because, by "Circuits of Mind" and "Mind grows circuits/lambda functions" theories (cited in previous sections), biological neurons are connected as a graph and information from sensory perception is transmitted through these neurons. Threshold TC circuits theoretically formalize neural networks. Better neuroimaging techniques for quantifying the potentials created in brain by cerebral representation of a text could be ideal relevance measures and can be substituted in Tensor Neuron Model of Recursive Lambda Function Growth algorithm.

There is special case of intrinsic merit: For example, reading a story creates a mental picture of it as a graph of events. Objectively judging it could vary from one human to the other making it subjective. But still the absolute objective merit can be defined for such a special case by applying EventNet to this problem - whole set of events are laid out as events with partakers with cause-effect edges amongst them.

410.2 WordNet and Word2Vec - https://yaledatascience.github.io/2017/03/17/nnnlp.html - In word2vec words from text are represented in a vector space and contextually related words are close enough in proximity on vector space. Word2Vec is a recent neural network model of word relations similar to Neural Tensor Network (NTN). NTN defines a relation between two words as a tensor neuron and thus complete WordNet can be defined as a graph with Tensor Neuron as edge potentials. This is the motivation for invoking Neural Tensor WordNet as an objective intrinsic merit indicator as it approximates human brain neurological text comprehension and visualization.
410.3 Random Walks on WordNet - http://anthology.aclweb.org/N/N15/N15-1165.pdf - Recursive Lambda Function Growth algorithm does something similar to this. It finds all random walks on Recursive Gloss Overlap graph (described in 385) and constructs a lambda function composition tree for each such walk and assigns a Neural Tensor Potential to each edge of these trees.
410.4 ImageNet - Pictorial WordNet - http://www.image-net.org/ - image net is recently available. In the context of Recursive Lambda Function Growth, lambda functions inferred from ImageNet than WordNet/ConceptNet are pictures and composition of the lambda functions translates to animating the pictures based on PoS or tensor relation. For example the composition for "It rained heavily today", rained(It, heavily(today)), should theoretically compose/superpose/animate images for day, heaviness, rain from leaves to root of the tree.

412. (THEORY) Graph Neural Networks, Tensor Neurons and Recursive Lambda Function Growth Intrinsic Merit - 4 June 2017 and
8 June 2017 - related to 410
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Definition Recursive Gloss Overlap Graph with word-word edges as Neuron Tensor Network relations having potentials was defined previously. Recursive Lambda Function Growth computes all random walks of the definition graph and creates a lambda function composition tree for each such random walk. For each subtree f of the recursive lambda function growth with children w1 and w2 composed potential for f is defined as:
	p(f(w1,w2)) = p(w1) * p(w2) for some operator *

Rather than mere summation of potentials of edges following minmax criterion extracts the most meaningful random walk:
*) Minimum Neuron Tensor Potential edge of each random walk is found - path minimum potential
*) Maximum of all minimum path potentials extracts a random walk lambda composition tree which is the most probable inferred meaning of the document - Max(Min(potentials)) - this makes sense because maximum of minimum potential implies minimum possible neural activation.

Event Related Potentials (ERP) mentioned in 202 are unusual spikes in EEG of brain (N400 dataset) when unrelated words are read. Complement of ERP for related words as dataset could be an ideal estimator for Neuron Tensor relatedness potential between two words in definition graph.

Graph Neural Networks are recent models of neural network which generalize to a graph. In a Graph Neural Network, potential of each vertex is a function of potentials of all adjacent vertices and neuron tensor potentials of incoming edges from them. Neuron Tensor Network edge relations for each word vertices pair of Recursive Gloss Overlap Graph can be mapped to edges of a Graph Neural Network. Thus a text is mapped to not just a graph but to a Graph Neural Network with Tensor Neuron Edges, an ideal choice for human text comprehension simulation. Recursive Gloss Overlap Graph with Neuron Tensor word-word edges combines two concepts into one - Graph Tensor Neuron Network (GTNN).

Data on websites can be classified into 3 categories: 1) text 2) voice 3) images and videos. Intrinsic merit which is a measure of creativity presently focuses only on text. Analyzing the intrinsic merit of voice and visuals is a separate field in itself - Fourier Analysis of Waveforms and Discrete Fourier Transforms.

Ranking text by Graph Tensor Neuron Network intrinsic merit potential can be done in multiple ways:
- Rank Vertices and Edges by potential
- Rank the random walk lambda function composition tree by potential
- Rank by Korner Entropy of the Graph Tensor Neuron Network and other qualitative and quantitative graph complexity metrics.
and so on.

Example lambda composition tree on a random walk of recursive gloss overlap graph:
	f1 = requiredby(fuel, flight)
	f2 = has(flight, tyre)
	f3 = has(tyre, wheel)
	f4 = does(wheel, landing)
	f5 = requires(landing, gear)
	f1(fuel, f2(flight, f3(tyre, f4(wheel, f5(landing, gear)))))

Previous example random walk lambda composition tree has been constructed in 384 and 385. Potentials for Tensor Neuron Relations have to be predetermined by a dataset if such exists similar to N400 EEG dataset. Tensor Neuron Relations in Recursive Gloss Overlap Definition Graph are grammatical connectives mostly. In this example, "requiredby" is a relation. Cumulative potential of each such random walk lambda composition tree has to be computed.

Difference in Graph Tensor Neuron Network mapping of a text is: Each lambda composition tree is evaluated as a Graph Neural Network - each subtree is evaluated and passed on to higher level - and potential at the root is returned as the merit. Mixing time in markov chain andom walk is the number of steps before stationary distribution is attained. Thus maximum potential returned at the root of (a lambda composition graph tensor neuron network of (any converging stationary random walk of (a recursive gloss overlap definition graph of (a text)))) is a measure of intrinsic merit.

Intuition for Graph Tensor Neuron Network is below:
*) Random walk on recursive gloss overlap graph simulates randomness in cognitive cerebral text comprehension.
*) Tensor Neuron relatedness potential between two word vertices in definition graph quantifies relevance and meaningfulness
*) Lambda composition tree-graph neural network for each random walk on definition graph simulates how meaning is recursively understood bottom-up with randomness involved.

418. (THEORY) Thought Experiment of Generic Intrinsic Merit and Condorcet Jury Theorem - 21 June 2017
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Intrinsic merit so far is restricted to text documents. Subjective ranking measures are like mirrors which reflect the real merit of the
candidate. Each vote in the majority voting is similar to an image of the votee projected on to the voter mirror. Some mirrors reflect well
while others don't. Efficiency of a voter mirror is equivalent to decision correctness of a voter. Present web ranking algorithms measure votee by the perception mirror images, which is indirect. Intrinsic merit breaks mirror images and relies only on what the votee really is. But then isn't intrinisic merit a mirror image too? It is not because no human perception or image based voting is involved to ascertain merit. Only the graph complexity of the text-graph and its graph neural network is sufficient. Merit is a universal requirement. Examples in 410 and 202 motivate it. Can merit be applied to entities beyond voice, visuals and text? Most probably yes. Intelligence of human beings are ranked by intelligence quotients which is also an intrinsic merit measure (though IQ tests are disputed by psychological studies). Hence judging people by intrinsic merit is beyond just IQ scores. An algorithm to classify people as "Good" and "Bad" could be a breakthrough in machine intelligence. Hypothetical people classifier could be as below:
(*) Peruse academic records and translate to score
(*) Peruse work records and translate to score
(*) Translate awards received to score
(*) Translate brain imageing data to score (EEG and fMRI)
(*) Translate IQ or EQ to score
Above is not a formal algorithm but tries to intuit how it may look like. Human Resource Analytics are done as above

Objective Intrinsic Merit = Vote by an algorithm
Subjective Ranking = Votes by people translated into rank by an algorithm (present ranking algorithms rely on incoming links or votes to a text which are created by human beings)

Thus Generic Intrinsic Merit removes human element completely while assessing merit (closer to AI).Goodness when it applies to human beings is not just a record based score and usually has moral and ethical elements in it. People classifier based on intrinsic merit has to be intrusive and invasive similar to HR analytics example earlier.

(*)Question: Why should intrinsic merit be judged only in this way?
(*)Answer: This is not the only possible objective intrinsic merit judgement. There could be other ways too. Disclaimer is intrinsic merit assumes cerebral representation of sensory reception (words, texts, visuals, voices etc.,) and its complexity to be the closest to ideal judgement.

(*)Question: Wouldn't cerebral representation vary from person to person and thus be subjective?
(*)Answer: Yes, but there are standardized event related potential datasets gathered from multiple neuroscience experiments on human subjects. Such ERP data are similar for most brains. Variation in potential occurs because cerebral cortex and its sulci&gyri vary from person to person. It has been found that cortex and complexity of gray matter determine intelligence and grasping ability. Intrinsic merit should therefore be based on best brain potential data.

(*)Question: Isn't perception based ranking enough? Why is such an intrusive objective merit required?
(*)Answer: Yes and No. Perception majority voting based ranking is accurate only if  all voters have decision correctness probability > 0.5 from Condorcet Jury Theorem. PageRank works well in most cases because incoming edges vote mostly with >50% correctness. This correctness is accumulated by a Markov Chain Random Walk recursively - vote from a good vertex to another vertex implies voted vertex is good (Bonacich Power Centrality) and so on. Initial goodness is based on weight of an edge. Markov iteration stabilizes the goodness. Probability that goodness of stationary Markov distribution < 0.5 can be obtained by a tail bound and should be exponentially meagre.

It was mentioned earlier that Fourier analysis of visuals and voice is the measure of intrinsic merit. Following definition of generic intrinsic merit further strengthens it:
Generic intrinsic merit of an entity - text, visual or voice - is the complexity of cerebral representation potential as received by sensory perception.  For texts it is the graph complexity measure. For voice and visuals it could ERPs activated on seeing or hearing and based on EEG data.

419. (THEORY) Goodness of Link Graph Majority Voting and Complex Plane representation of merit - 22 June 2017 and 23 June 2017 - related to 418
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Following is an example link graph in world wide web with weights for each edge:
	y1 - x1 : 0.25
	y1 - x2 : 0.25
	y1 - x3 : 0.25
	y1 - x4 : 0.25
implying y1 votes to x1,x2,x3,x4 with weight 0.25 each.

Following is the corresponding initial decision correctness (goodness) graph with goodness for each edge:
	y1 - x1 : 0.25
	y1 - x2 : 0.25
	y1 - x3 : 0.375
	y1 - x4 : 0.125
implying y1 votes to x1 with correctness 0.25, x2 with correctness 0.25, x3 with correctness 0.375 and x4 with correctness 0.125.

Markov iteration on the decision correctness graph (similar to random walk on link graph) tends to a stationary distribution after certain number of random walks. Cumulative goodness of voter v1 is defined as:
	summation(weight(edge) * goodness(edge))
For previous example cumulative goodness of voter y1 is:
	0.25*0.25 + 0.375*0.25 + 0.25*0.25 + 0.25*0.25 =
	1/32 + 3/32 + 2/32 + 2/32 = 0.25

If all votes are 100% correctly decided by y1, correctness graph has 1 for all edge weights. Thus cumulative goodness of y1 is:
	0.25 * 1 + 0.25 * 1 + 0.25 * 1 + 0.25 * 1 = 1 = 100%
After markov iteration attains stationary distribution, cumulative goodness of all vertices also becomes stationary. Atleast one incoming vertex y voting to another vertex x having cumulative goodness < 0.5 at the end of markov iteration implies group decision is a failure and does not concur with the real merit of a vertex x.

Following are the votes received by a vertex x1 from voters y1,y2,y3,y4 having respective cumulative goodness:
	y1 - x1: 0.75
	y2 - x1: 0.3 (voter with cumulative goodness < 0.5)
	y3 - x1: 0.8
	y4 - x1: 0.9

What is the probability in average case that atleast one voting vertex has cumulative goodness < 0.5? Link graph voting is different from normal voting - it is peer to peer and each voter apportions vote to the neighbouring candidates - single voter can vote multiple candidates simultaneously.

Pr[atleast one adjacent vertex y to a candidate vertex x has cumulative goodness < 0.5 after markov iteration] = 1 - Pr[goodness > 0.5]

From Markov inequality tail bound, Pr[cumulative goodness > 0.5] <= mean/0.5
Pr[cumulative goodness < 0.5] = 1 - Pr[goodness > 0.5] >= 1 - mean/0.5
where mean is the average cumulative goodness of all vertices in link graph.

When mean is 0.5 (uniform distribution), Pr[cumulative goodness < 0.5] >= 1 - 0.5/0.5 = 0
For any other values of mean < 0.5, Pr[atleast one adjacent vertex y to a candidate vertex x has cumulative goodness < 0.5 after markov iteration] = 1 - mean/0.5 is always greater than zero.

In discrete random variable case, if goodness takes n discrete values between 0 and 1 then, mean = summation(x*p(x)) where p(x) = 1/n is:
	n(n+1)/2*n*n = 0.5 + 0.5/n which tends to 0.5 when n tends to infinity.
Thus mean cumulative goodness is 0.5 in uniform distribution.

Objective and Subjective rankings can be represented on a complex plane with following notation:
	(intrinsic merit=m) + i(perception=p) = m + ip
where p is a function of m. Any text,visual or voice can be plotted on complex plane in previous notation. Ideally m should be equal to p. This creates a special case when m is fixed and p varies for an entity which usually happens with perception based majority voting. Such set of complex numbers with fixed merit and varying perception can be thought of as zeros of a complex valued function. Famous special case is Riemann Zeta Function with merit=0.5 and varying perception imaginary parts.

Riemann Hypothesis if true implies Re=0.5 for non trivial zeros of Riemann Zeta Function. If a set of complex number rankings as described previously have Re=0.5 or fixed real part and varying imaginary parts equalling non trivial zeros of Riemann Zeta Function, then the rankings show pattern in prime numbers an unusual connection.

Any k-coloring of a sequence of text and audio-visuals(AVs) denoted by integers is a classifier. 2-coloring or complementation is a special case of such a classifier. Conversely, any classifier is a coloring scheme for sequence of text and audio-visuals(AVs). For example following bit pattern is a 2-coloring/complement function - 0 and 1 are colors and f and g are complement functions illustrated as dotted indentations:

Vapnik-Chervonenkis Shattering or VC Shattering is defined as:
Let H be a set of sets and C be a set. C is shattered by H if H intersection C = powerset of C = 2^C. Intuitively, H classifies C with labels from the set H. Largest cardinality of C shattered by H is the VC dimension.

2-coloring/complementation is a classifier on real line or integer sequences. 2 colors/binary encodings/complementations create a set H of size equal to powerset of real line of integer sequence. Largest cardinality of real line or integer sequence that can be shattered by H ( H intersection C = 2^C) is infinite. Thus 2-color/complementation classifier of infinite stream of sequences has VC Dimension Infinity.

420. (THEORY) Human Resource Analytics, Interview Algorithm and Intrinsic Merit - related to 314, 359 and 365 - 26 June 2017 and 27 June 2017
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stability of Interview TQBF circuit which is the theoretical formalism of Interview Algorithm Intrinsic Merit has been analyzed earlier as opposed to stability of Majority Voting. Extending the notion of merit from WWW to humans is the most obvious consequence. Usual interview procedure in industry is to screen resumes, shortlist them and interview for few rounds and make an offer. Does this tradition measure merit flawlessly? No. Error in interview and its stability has been analyzed in 359 and 365. Is there a way to circumvent this error and remove human element completely? Error in interview process applies to examination system in academics too. Real-life interviews and examinations have duration of few hours and rely on question-answering. Can few hours measure years of accrued merit? This question is reduced to sampling problem. If merit is a scatter-plot of feature vector points on a metric space V of n-dimensions, a sample is a set of subspaces S which approximate V. Contraction Mapping (and Banach Fixed Point Theorem) maps a space to a subspace and there is always a unique fixed point in this map (f(x)=x for some x in V). An intrinsic merit analyzer can be thought of as a contraction map on the metric space of merit feature vectors of an individual. This contraction map must create a sample subspace in such a way that all merit feature vectors are near-perfectly measured. This involves 2 difficult problems:
(*) Construct a complete merit metric feature vector space for an individual based on past records( work and academic ).
(*) Construct a contraction map(s) which contracts this merit vector space into a sample subspace. This contraction map is then translated into an interview TQBF function. Objective Question-Answers (multiple choice) are relatively easy to construct and evaluate than descriptive, subjective question-answers.

Real life interviews typically have following usecase (e.g IT industry) - a slightly modified version of previous TQBF construction:
(*) suitability for a requirement
(*) technical discussions (question-answering on programming/projects etc.,)
(*) experience

Intrinsic Merit of Collection of Humans are measured in economics literature by many indices like GDP,Human Development Index(HDI),Inequality adjusted HDI,Gender Inequality Index,Purchasing Power Parity(PPP) etc.,Human Development Index defined as geometric mean of standard of life,income,education indices is used to rank countries by their development.Intrinsic Merit of sportspersons are measured by Intrinsic Performance Rating(IPR) measures e.g Elo rating in Chess is used to rank players. Translating the previous example, one possible IPR for interview is the following adapted from HDI (not necessarily perfect):
	IPR(candidate)=geometric_mean(IPR(interview)*IPR(education)*IPR(experience))

From 359 and 365, NoiseSensitivity(InterviewTQBF) which is the dual of Stability is defined as:
	NoiseSensitivity(InterviewTQBF) = 0.5-0.5*Stability(InterviewTQBF) = 0.5-0.5*a^2*n^2/4

Error in interview is equal to NoiseSensitivity of interview TQBF. What is the probability of interview process failing? By Markov tail bound:
	Pr[Error in interview process > e ] <= mean/e where mean is the average error or NoiseSensitivity of interview. Therefore:
	Pr[Error in interview process > e ] <= NoiseSensitivity(InterviewTQBF)/e

While suitability can be easiliy quantified for error and interview TQBF having previous error bound, experience is a new variable in real-life HR analytics. Experience of a candidate is total duration in industry (academics,private initiatives inclusive). Experience itself is indirectly caused by past interviews. For example, a person having 30 years experience from 10 companies was meritorious in past 10 interviews and it is counterintuitive if 11th finds no merit (this contradiction makes objective merit subjective and in a sense this is also an error in interview process - a flawed TQBF). Thus experience is a function of merit and gradually makes future interviews redundant - an example below:
	Experience = f(number of job/academic/private hops, intrinsic merit at each previous hop, experience per hop)

Interview algorithm being a TQBF satisfiability problem is PSPACE-complete (=IP=AP). There are existing question-answering systems like IBM watson (answer-questioning) which beat humans in Jeopardy with least error, a contest like Turing test, Question-Answering using WordNet as Word Sense Disambiguator and older expert-system based Q&A software. But there does not seem to exist a theoretical decision tree parallel for QBF similar to boolean decision trees except DPLL evaluations. An error in interview QBF can also be formalised as a Lambda-Tolerant Randomized Decision Tree having access to pseudorandom bits and making errors with an upperbound while evaluating decision tree.

TQBF formulation of question-answering is far stringent than traditional interviews. Existential and Universal quantifiers simulate "there exists an answer or a counter-question for all questions" instead of "there exists an answer for a question". In proving lowerbounds for games like Chess, Go etc., TQBF is evaluated as game-tree (alpha-beta pruning) - "for all moves there exists a countermove" where each level choices in the tree alternate between 2 opponents for bounded (polynomial) or unbounded (exponential) number of rounds.

Intrinsic merit metric space of feature vector points can be construed as a Hypergraph with feature vector points as vertices and edges spanning multiple of these points which are related as edges. Hypergraph edge connects more than two vertices. Transversal or Hitting Set of a Hypergraph is the subset  S of the vertices X which have non-empty intersection with all hyperedges. Transversal graph is a subgraph of this hypergraph consisting of all possible minimal transversals(a minimal transversal has no other traversals as subsets). Transversal graph is a "summary" of the larger graph and thus is a Contraction Map which creates a gist of the merit metric space.

Similar notion of transversal hypergraph can be applied to Recursive Gloss Overlap Definition Graph too (considering it as a hypergraph), for text summarization - subset of word vertices which intersect all hyperedges. Hypergraph Transversal Problem is known to be in co-NP.

Like usual text documents, candidate resumes can be represented as either a Recursive Gloss Overlap graph or a ThoughtNet hypergraph:
*) Graph: Resume text is mapped to a graph by Recursive Gloss Overlap algorithm. Core number based classifier brings out the best in the graph - candidate experience domains in resume that are closely related
*) Hypergraph: Resumes are stored in ThoughtNet as Hypergraph index. Querying results in similar resumes. ThoughtNet internally invokes Recursive Gloss Overlap core number classifier.

421. (FEATURE-DONE) Text Summarization from Recursive Gloss Overlap Graph Core - Commits - 28 June 2017
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(*) Added a new function to create a summary from text - This function creates the core of a Recursive Gloss Overlap graph
with certain core number and writes out a text sentence for each edge in core subgraph obtaining least common ancestor(hypernym) relation
(*) logs for this have been committed to python-src/testlogs

Summarization from k-core(s) of a Recursive Gloss Overlap graph captures the most crucial areas of the text because document belongs to the class/word vertex with high core numbers.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
422. (FEATURE-DONE) Text Summarization from Recursive Gloss Overlap Graph Core - Commits - 30 June 2017
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(*) New clause added to classify the text and match the prominent core number word vertices in the text and only add those sentences to summary.
(*) This is an alternative to k-core subgraph traversal and creating text programmatically. It is based on the heuristic that a summary should
capture the essence/classes the text belongs to.
(*) Prominent core number classes are shaved off from the sorted core number list returned by RGO classifier and top percentile is used. Summary is limited in size relative to the original text.

423. (THEORY) Dense Subgraph Problem and Mining patterns in Graph Representation of Text - 2 July 2017
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recursive Gloss Overlap and Recursive Lambda Function Growth algorithms create graphs from text documents. Unsupervised classification from
prominent vertices of the definition graph and Text summarization at present depend on finding k-core subgraphs. In general this is an NP hard
problem to find Dense Subgraphs of a Graph where density of a subgraph S of a graph G is defined as:
	d(S) = |Edges of S| / |Vertices of S|
There are polynomial time maxflow based algorithms and approximations to find dense subgraphs of a graph.

424. (THEORY) Pseudorandom non-majority choice and Bounded Electorate Majority Choice - 3 July 2017 - related to 53.7
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bounded Electorate Majority Choice:
-----------------------------------
Odd Electorate with 3 voters is the minimum possible majority voting setting which vouchsafes a clear winner. This is a composition (both formula and circuit) of NC majority voting function with Voter SATs. This composition can be written as a unified formula by substituting the voter SAT formulas in formula for Majority function which has formula of size O(n^5.3). This combined formula can be converted to a 3-CNF by Tseitin transformation. This specific 3 voter example is NP-complete. Similar substitution for infinite electorate majority could be undecidable.

Pseudorandom Non-majority Choice:
--------------------------------
Majority social choice has only one level of error probability i.e goodness for each voter while Non-majority pseudorandom social choice invoking a PRG has 2 levels of probabilities - 1) Probability of choosing a voter SAT at random 2) Goodness probability of chosen voter SAT and thus conditional.

Let number of voter decision functions with goodness xi = m(xi). Total number of voters N = m(x1)+m(x2)+m(x3)+...+m(xn)
Effective goodness of a PRG choice is the mean:
	1/N * summation(xi*m(xi)) = (x1*m(x1) + x2*m(x2) + x3*m(x3) + ... + xn*m(xn)) / N
When all voter functions have goodness 1 then PRG choice has effective goodness 1.

Probability of choosing a voter of Goodness xi = m(xi)/N
Conditional goodness probability of a PRG chosen voter SAT =
Pr[choosing voter SAT of goodness xi] * Pr[goodness of SAT] = [m(xi)/N]*xi

When m(xi)*xi/N = 1, Goodness of PRG choice is 1. This can happen only if m(xi)*xi = N => m(xi) = N and xi = 1 i.e all voters have equal goodness 1 because smaller values of xi require m(xi) > N , a contradiction. This is a BPP/BPNC/RNC/RP algorithm despite the goodness being 1 because Pseudorandom bits have to be created by a PRG.
--------------------------------
When goodness is 1 for both LHS PRG choice and RHS Bounded Electorate Majority Choice, PRG choice is a BPP/BPNC/RNC/RP algorithm to NP-complete Majority Choice for finite voters => NP is in BPP/BPNC/RNC/RP. But BPP is in P/poly. Therefore NP is in P/poly if NP is in BPP. From Karp-Lipton theorem if NP is in P/poly, PH collapses to Sigma(p,2) and NP in P/poly implies AM=MA by [Arvind, Vikraman; Köbler, Johannes; Schöning, Uwe; Schuler, Rainer (1995)]. This independently leads to a similar bound mentioned earlier for Percolation Boolean Voter Functions for Non-majority social choice which have 100% Noise stability (LHS is a P/poly percolation circuit with 100% goodness while RHS is NP-complete finite electorate).

NP in P/poly also implies PH is in P/poly. It is not known if this implies PH-complete problems exist (because PH collapsing to second level causes every k-QBFSAT problem in PH to reduce to 2-QBFSAT sigma(p,2) and thus PH-hardness is proved).

PH-completeness proof outline:
------------------------------
If NP is in BPP, NP is in P/poly because BPP is in P/poly.
=> If NP is in P/poly, PH is in Sigma(p,2) from Karp-Lipton-Sipser Collapse Theorem
=> If NP is in P/poly, PH collapses to P/poly
=> There are complete problems in each level k of the Polynomial Hierarchy(correspond to a k-depth QBFSAT).
=> There is a complete problem in Sigma(p,2) corresponding to 2-QBFSAT.
=> All problems in Sigma(p,2) can be reduced to this Sigma(p,2)-complete 2-QBFSAT problem.
=> All problems in PH collapse to Sigma(p,2) if NP is in P/poly
=> All problems in PH can be reduced to this Sigma(p,2)-complete 2-QBFSAT problem.
=> Sigma(p,2)-complete problem is thus a PH-Complete problem

425. (FEATURE-DONE) Updates to Text Summarization from Dense Subgraph of Recursive Gloss Overlap graph of a Text -
Commits - 4 July 2017
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(*) import matplotlib commented in RGO classifier
(*) New clause added to Text Summarization: This finds the common path between 2 word vertices synsets by inheriting an
existing WordNet code for shortest wordnet path distance and constructs sentences by a sliding window for each successive
pair of intermediate vertices in this common path. This creates a deeper profund summary than least_common_hypernyms().Sentences thus created are sorted based on a relevance score to the actual text - size of intersection similar to Lesk WSD. Only top relevant sentences can be chosen as required.
(*) Logs for this have been committed to testlogs/.
 
It has to be noted that, dense subgraph traversal and writing unguided summary sans training data mimicks human recursive
comprehension and looks non-conventional for human reading. Presently only hypernym (IS A) relation is used for connectives.
More comprehensive humane-looking summary can be created by Meronyms (HAS A) and Holonyms(IS PART OF) in WordNet API. ConceptNet 5 which is a better semantic framework for finding relations between concepts could do well in this context. But
presently there is no python API for ConceptNet5 and data has to be queried as RESTful JSON objects.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
426. (FEATURE-DONE) Updates to Text Summarization - Commits - 5 July 2017
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(*) Changed the class-sentence matching clause by increasing the percentile of prominent classes
(*) Changed relevance_to_text() by comparing each sentence chosen by prominent class match to the sentences in text - Ratcliff-Obershelp
Longest Common Subsequence matching difflib library function is invoked for this similarity. Sentences are chosen also based on relevance_to_text() scoring
(*) Percentage of summary to the size of the text has been printed as a ratio. Logs have been committed to testlogs/

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
427. (FEATURE-DONE) Updates to Text Summarization - choosing sentences matching class labels - 6 July 2017
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(*) Some experimentation on choosing relevant sentences to be added to summary was performed
(*) relevance_to_text() invocation has been changed as per algorithm below:
for each prominent dense subgraph k-core class label
find the synset definition of class label
for each sentence
invoke relevance_to_text() similarity function between sentence and the class label definition
and add to summary if the relevance ratio > 0.41 and if not already in summary
(*) Ratio 0.41 was arrived at heuristically:
- For relevance ratio 0.1, summary ratio was 0.65
- For relevance ratio 0.2, summary ratio was 0.48
- For relevance ratio 0.3, summary ratio was 0.35
- For relevance ratio 0.4, summary ratio was 0.21
- For relevance ratio 0.5, summary ratio was 0.02
There is a drastic dip in size of summary if relevance threshold is increased beyond 0.4. Because of this 0.41 has been
hardcoded.
(*) Logs for this have been added to testlogs/
(*) Summary generated is human readable - subset chosen from actual text.

428. (FEATURE-DONE) ConceptNet 5.4 Python RESTful API implementation - lookup, search and association - 7 July 2017
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(*) This commit implements the RESTful Python requests HTTP API for querying ConceptNet 5.4 dataset
(*) Three functions for looking up a concept, searching a concept and finding similar associated concepts have been
implemented with 3 endpoints (as per the documentation in https://github.com/commonsense/conceptnet5/wiki/API/2349f2bbd1d7fb726b3bbdc14cbeb18f0a40ef18)
(*) ConceptNet is quite different from WordNet in representation as JSON dictionary as against graph in WordNet.
(*) ConceptNet 5.4 endpoints have been invoked instead of 5.
(*) If necessary ConceptNet can replace all WordNet invocations in a later point in time. But such a replacement is non-trivial and would
probably require almost all Recursive Gloss Overlap related code to be rewritten from scratch. But that depends on how ConceptNet 5
weighs against WordNet in measuring semantic meaningfulness.

429. (THEORY) Contradictions in bounds between finite and infinite electorate - 8,10,11,12,13 July 2017
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lowerbounds by equating the goodness of Non-majority and Majority social choice thus far mentioned in drafts in this document (subject to errors) are based on following assumptions:
	(*) There are two possible paths to social choice - Non-majority and Majority
	(*) Each social choice belongs to a computational complexity class
	(*) Goodness of a social choice is the measure of error-free-ness of the choice made in either paths i.e decision correctness (e.g noise stability, sensitivity,error in BP* algorithm etc.,)
	(*) RHS Majority voting has been assumed to abide by Homegeneous version of Condorcet Jury Theorem convergence and divergence of group decision goodness as a function of individual voter goodness while LHS is either a pseudorandom choice or an interview TQBF algorithm
	(*) Goodness of either choice majority or non-majority must be equal
	(*) Either LHS or RHS has to be a complete problem for a complexity class C.
	(*) Traditional literature on boolean majority functions and circuits assumes that input to majority is readily available which is equivalent to SAT oracle access to Majority function where SAT oracle could belong to any complexity class (2-SAT, 3-SAT, k-QBFSAT, etc.,) => Majority voting is in P^NP,P^PH,P^EXP etc.,
	(*) Previous Oracle access based proofs have been intentionally circumvented by replacing Oracles with Boolean Function/Circuit compositions which have strong Communication Complexity basis (KW relations and depth of a circuit composition mentioned in 368)
	(*) Assuming all above, LHS is an algorithm for RHS complete problem (or viceversa) creating a lowerbound.
	(*) All bounds derived in this draft assuming above do not follow conventional lowerbound techniques e.g Circuit Lower Bounds. Equal goodness assumption implies - "both algorithms solve same problem - one is more efficient than the other".
	(*) Most importantly drafts in this document are just analyses of various social choice functions, their complexities and contradictions irrespective of attaining lowerbounds.

Equality of Goodness of PRG choice and Majority voting for finite electorate of size 3:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let x1,x2,x3 be the goodness of 3 voter SATs. PRG choice randomly chooses one of the 3 voters while majority voting is the usual CJT Majority+SAT composition.

Goodness of PRG choice:
----------------------
= (x1*m(x1) + x2*m(x2) + x3*m(x3)) / 3
When all 3 have equal goodness 1, effective goodness is:
= (1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1)/3 = 1

Goodness of Majority choice:
----------------------------
This is the bounded version of CJT binomial series summation. When x1=x2=x3=1:
= (3C2(1)^2(0)^1 + 3C3(1)^3(0)^0)  = (0 + 1) = 1

Possible Lowerbounds described previously for Unbounded and Bounded electorate lead to contradictions as below:
(*) In infinite voter case, homogeneous voter CJT circuit in BPP is derandomized to P if CJT converges => P=BPP.
(*) In finite voter case, NP-complete RHS has BPP algorithm in LHS (NP in BPP) implying NP in P/poly and collapse of PH => NP in P/poly and PH in P/poly.

Contradiction 1 :
-----------------
If BPP=P (unbounded CJT) and NP is in BPP (bounded) then NP is in P=BPP => P=NP. This conflicts with P != NP implied by :
	(*) the Majority Hardness Lemma (318),
	(*) Polytime learning of NP implying NP does not have polytime algorithms (368) and
	(*) HLMN PARITYSAT counterexample (53.15)
but concurs with :
	(*) high percentage of random k-SATs satisified in Approximate CNF SAT solver by least squares (376).

But can infinite voter CJT circuit be in BPP and thus in P/poly? Infinite voter CJT circuit is of polynomial size if it is polynomial in number of Voter SAT variables and exponential if it is exponential in number of variables. Latter happens only if all voters have dissimilar SAT variables while common variables across voter SATs make it exponential. This is described in example of 53.8. Condorcet Jury Theorem convergence in homogeneous voters case implies all voters are similar (e.g have similar voting SATs) thus ruling out polynomial size case i.e Unbounded CJT circuit can not both be in BPP and converging. This contradiction stems from the assumption - BPP derandomizes to P. LHS could be in RP too. RP is contained in NP. (Can BPP derandomize to NP i.e BPP in NP?). Another assumption is all voters have 3-SAT choice functions. If all voter SATs are 2-SATs (in P), infinite and finite voter cases are not equatable and there is no contradiction. Known result: If NP is in BPP, NP=RP - this applies to bounded voting case above. Thus BPP=P possibility is removed by exponential sized CJT circuit and BPEXP=EXP is still possible when CJT converges. Contradiction 1 is avoided.

Contradiction 2 :
-----------------
If NP is in BPP and thus in P/poly (irrespective of BPP=P), similar conflicts arise. An assumption made in composition of 3-SAT voters and Majority function for bounded electorate in 424 is resultant composition is also in NP (depth lowerbound for this composition can be obtained by KW relations in 368). This assumption could be false because composition of NP 3-SAT with non-uniform NC1 majority function could be harder than mere NP - because this is equivalent to replacing oracle with a circuit composition in a P^NP algorithm. P with NP oracle adds an additional quantifier and places it in second level of polynomial hierarchy (inclusion in https://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~regan/papers/ComplexityPoster.jpg shows there are problems in Sigma(p,2) /\ Pi(p,2) which also have BPP algorithms and P^NP is contained in Sigma(p,2) /\ Pi(p,2)). Thus a PRG choice and converging bounded electorate voting of equal goodness need not imply NP in BPP. This composition may not be a complete problem. Stricter oracle definition of Majority+SAT composition is NC1(L) where Majority is computable by non-uniform circuits or BWBP with oracle access to gates belonging to a class L. For 3-SAT voter oracles, CJT majority voting circuit is in NC1(NP) (is this contained in P^NP?). Subject to equal goodness, composition equivalent of NC1(NP) is in BPP and not NP is in BPP.

Reference 429.3 suggests there exists a random oracle A relative to which NC^A is in P^A. P having NP oracle access is known as class delta(p,2)=P^NP. This answers if NC1^NP is in P^NP in the affirmative. There is a known delta(p,2)-complete problem mentioned in reference 429.5. If bounded electorate NC1^NP problem is complete for its class, then equal goodness of PRG choice and bounded majority voting implies NC1^NP is in BPP. This in turn implies NP is in BPP (if NC1^NP strictly contains NP) and thus NP is in P/poly again leading to contradiction in the outset.

Replacing oracles with compositions and applying depth lowerbounds for Majority+VoterSAT circuit composition as below for m voters with n variables per voter SAT (from 368):
	D(Maj + Voter) = CommunicationComplexity(R(Maj,Voter)) >= 5.3*logm  + n - O(m*logm/n)
does away with the hassles of relativization and directly gives the depth lowerbound of the majority voting circuit composition. Size of this composition is the alternately phrased KRW conjecture in 429.7.

Example delta(p,2)-complete problem mentioned in 429.5:
-----------------------------------------------------
While number of queries to NP oracle <= k
{
	(*) Query a 3SAT oracle for a satisfying assignment for a 3CNF Voter SAT
	(*) Store the queried satisfying assignment in a linked list in sorted order - this is linear per insertion i.e traverse the list and compare the two adjacent nodes. E.g. {1,5}, {1,3,5}, {1,3,5,6}, {1,3,5,6,7}... upto k-th query and lexicographic ordering is preserved by a decimal encoding of SAT oracle query string.
}
Output 1 if last element in the list ends with binary 1 digit.

This algorithm makes k queries to an NP oracle and has O(k^2) time complexity and thus in delta(p,2). Hardness follows by reducing any polynomial time algorithm with NP oracle to above - reasonably straightforward because oracle queries are memoized and can be looked-up in polynomial time.

Mapping above delta(p,2) complete problem to proving completeness of NC1^NP majority voting is non-trivial. Majority function can make n queries to n voter SAT oracles and atleast n/2 + 1 queries should return 1 or 0 to compute majority in NC1. Beyond this, NC reducibility has to be proved by Many-one/Turing reductions or Logspace reductions of any other problem in NC1^NP to this. Integer multiplication,powering and division have been proved to be equivalent (NC reducible to each other) mentioned in reference 429.8. NC reducibility through oracle NC gates have been proved in reference 429.9. Majority function is known not to be complete for NC1 under AC0 many-instances-to-one reductions (reference 429.10). This could probably imply that NC1^NP is not complete too, thereby avoiding contradiction 2.

But this also implies that any Majority^A for a random oracle A is not complete if Majority is not complete for NC1. Hence it has to be proved or disproved if a problem is not NC1 complete, it is not NC1^A complete for an oracle A. Lemma 3.3.9 in reference 429.9 [RuzzoGreenlawHoover] describes an Oracle PRAM or an NC oracle circuit M' to another NC circuit M. M has O(n^c) size/processors and depth/time of O(logn) and M makes at most O(n^c) oracle queries to M' (each node can query). But these oracle queries are made simultaneously in parallel time of O(logn). Thus replacing calls to M' by M' itself increases depth by O(logn) and size by O(n^c) order of magnitude i.e new circuit without oracle M' has time O((logn)^2) and size O(n^2c). Similar oracle replacement could be done for Majority^A circuits too. If oracle gates to Majority are replaced by circuit for A itself which has size s and depth d and Majority makes at most O(n^c) calls to oracle A, new Majority circuit without oracle has depth/time O(d*logn) and size/processors O(s*n^c). This new circuit need not be in NC1. From Spira's Theorem a circuit of size O(s*n^c) can be transformed into a circuit of depth O(log(s*n^c))=O(log(s) + c*log(n)). Following cases arise after replacing oracle gates with a new circuit of size s.

Case 1 - s = 2^n:
----------------
This makes the new majority circuit sans oracle to be of depth O(n*log2+c*log(n)) which is not polylog depth and polynomial size and thus lies outside NC - this new circuit problem could be complete for a different class. This line of reasoning coincides with previous formulations of majority voting based on depth bounds by Communication Complexity (KRW Conjecture) and Direct Connect circuit families of unbounded depth and exponential size. If there is a problem B in NC1, Majority^A and B^A can be in totally different depth hierarchy classes by depth hierarchy theorem. This could be a complete problem in different class (e.g, PH-complete, EXP-complete etc.,) and can be equated under equal goodness assumption with a non-majority social choice.

Case 2 - s = n^c:
-----------------
This new majority circuit has depth O(2*c*log(n)) and size O(n^2c) and is obviously in NC1 and computes majority. But majority is not complete for NC1 and thus majority voting itself is not a complete problem and cannot be equated under equal goodness assumption with a non-majority choice.

430. (THEORY) Theoretical Formalism for an Electronic Voting Machine based on Locality Sensitive Hashing - 13 and 14 July 2017 - related to 265,275,376 and 319
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Locality Sensitive Hashing and their relevance to Multiway Contests have been described in 319. Voters voting for same candidate are clustered together in a bucket chain of tabulation hashing. This is akin to a naive electronic voting machine which increments counters of a candidate for each vote cast for h(im/er). An LSH voting machine queries voter SAT oracles sequentially(or parallelly if there is a parallel LSH implementation), receives the candidate index, finds the candidate index key in LSH and appends the voter id to the bucket chain for the candidate. Sequential version of LSH voting machine is in delta(p,2)=P^NP because LSH is in P and oracle queries are made to voter 3SATs. LSH algorithms usually search for nearest neighbours and find similar items with high probability. For LSH based Electronic Voting Machine this rho parameter as defined in 319 is log(1/p1)/log(1/p2) where p1=Pr(h(x)=h(y)) if x and y had voted for same candidate and p2=Pr(h(x)=h(y)) if x and y had voted for different candidates. Simplest voting machine is an array of candidates and voters increment an array element for a candidate index which is exact and errorfree. But LSH voting generalizes the notion of voting as: "x and y vote for same candidate" is generalized to "x and y are similar or have similar liking". For example, a web search engine lists URL results for a query and all these URLs hash/vote to same query bucket in LSH parlance. Thus notion of exact candidate is replaced by an abstract similarity probability. Definition of rho thus allows error and its bounds are derived in references 430.2 and 430.3.

Non-boolean social choice functions which a voter computes to obtain a candidate index have been described previously. Previous LSH or array of counters based voting machine has following standard operating procedure:
	(*)  receives voters in a streaming sequence,
	(*)  each voter solves a non-boolean SAT (which could be in an arbitrary complexity class) having oracle access to it
	(*)  oracle returns a candidate index and counter is incremented
	(*)  LSH based voting has a special step - it compares two voters for similarity i.e if their oracle queries return same candidate index hash them to same bucket
	(*)  Multipartisan SAT Oracle internally has to implement the following:
		- Iterate through all candidates
		- Find the maximum number of clauses that can be satisfied by each candidate and quantify it as score which is NP-hard MAXSAT problem.
		- Sort the scores for the candidates and return the topranked candidate.
	(*) Sort the LSH by length of buckets
	(*) MAXSAT has been used in lieu of Exact SAT for grading the candidates based on number of clauses satisfied. Exact SAT would return either 1 or 0 only and doesn't compute percentage of clauses satisfied.
	(*) Random k-CNF SAT Solver implemented in 276 approximates by solving system of equations by least squares.
	(*) Boolean Majority function is a special case of multipartisan voting: Restrict the number of candidates to 2 indexed as 0 and 1 and apply LSH.
	(*) Voter SAT Oracles could be Constraint Satisfaction Problem(CSP) Solvers too which allow reals. This has been described in 265. Approximation of CSPs could be NP-hard if UGC is true.

Circuit Value Problem finds if a circuit encoding evaluates to 1 or 0 for an input assignment. This is equivalent to the following prover-verifier protocol:
	(*) Voter has a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (boolean or real)
	(*) Candidate has an assignment to the variables of voter CSP (Prover)
	(*) Voter verifies the assignment to CSP (Verifier)
This kind of Circuit Value Problem (CVP) formulation has been avoided throughout drafts in document for Majority Voting. This is because, equating goodness and Condorcet Jury Theorem application requires quantifying the decision correctness (or) accuracy of Voter SAT/CSP which is not feasible to compute in CVP. Class PP generalizes BPP by removing bounds on error. From Toda's Theorem, PH is contained in P^PP and P^#P. Goodness in LSH voting is exactly the rho parameter and if each voter SAT oracle in LSH with unbounded error is in PP (extent to which a voter is misclassified in a candidate bucket), LSH voting itself is in P^PP and thus subsumes PH. Another aspect of LSH voting is majority circuit fan-in is replaced by size of buckets.

432. (THEORY) MAXSAT ranking of text documents, Approximate CNF SAT solver and Lovasz Local Lemma - related to 431 -
19 July 2017
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Considering a set of text documents, ranking function r(X,A), is the subjective perception measure of a text X
with access to a perception oracle A:
	r(X,A) = subjective rank of X as perceived by an oracle A
In the context of web link graphs of HTML documents, every adjacent vertex of a node N is the perceiver of N and for two
adjacent vertices A and B of N:
	r(X,A) = r(X,B) or r(X,A) != r(X,B)
Perception ranking of a node need not be decided just by adjacent vertices at the end of random walk markov iterations. For example, there could be vertices which are not adjacent but yet could have indirect unaccounted for perception. An example of this are the readers of a website who do not link to it but yet have a perception. This perception is not reckoned in subjective link graph ranking.

Ranking of texts can be thought of as MAXSAT problem: Each reader of a text has a CNF (subjective) or all readers have fixed CNF (Intrinsic Objective Merit) which they apply on the qualitative and quantitative attributes of a text. CNF for measuring merit conjoins clauses for measuring meaningfulness of the text. Each literal in this CNF is a merit variable e.g Graph complexity measures like Korner Entropy , Graph Tensor Neuron Network Intrinsic Merit, Connectivity etc., Rank of the text is the percentage of clauses satisfied. This CNF based ranking unifies all subcategories of rankings.

Lovasz Local Lemma:
Let a1,a2,a3,...,an be set of events. If each event occurs with probability < p, and dependency digraph of these events have outdegree at most d, then the probability of non-occurrence of all these events is non-zero:
	Pr[/\ !ai] > 0 , if ep(d+1) < 1 for e=2.7128...

CNF formula can be translated into a graph where each vertex corresponds to a clause and there is an edge between any 2 clausevertices if they have a common literal (negated or unnegated). In approximate least-square SAT solver, let d+1 be the number of clauses per CNF. Then at most d other clauses can have literal overlap and thus CNF clause dependency graph can have maximum outdegree of d. Each event ai corresponds to not satisfying clause i in CNF.

From LLL, If p < 1/[e(d+1)] is the probability of an event (not satisfying a clause) :
Probability that clause is satisfied: 1-p > (1-1/[e(d+1)])
Probability that all of the clauses are satisfied > (1-1/[e(d+1)])^(d+1) (for d+1 clauses)
Probability that none of the clauses are satisfied < 1-(1-1/[e(d+1)])^(d+1)
In previous example d+1 = 14 and thus probability that none of the clauses are satisified for any random CNF is:
= 1-(1-1/[e(14)])^(14)  < ~31.11%
and probability of all the clauses being satisified for any random CNF is:
(1-1/[e(14)])^(14)  > ~68.89%

Experimental iterations of SAT solver converge as below (10000 CNFs):
Percentage of CNFs satisfied so far: 71.14
Average Percentage of Clauses per CNF satisfied: 97.505

This coincides with LLL lowerbounds above and far exceeds it because outdegree (common literals) is less and average percentage of CNFs satisfied is 71% after 10000 iterations. It has to be noted that average percentage of clauses satisfied per random CNF is 97% which implies that very few clauses fail per CNF.

       1) Betweenness Centrality

 slightly different
(*) But all 5 centrality measures reasonably capture the central purport of the text i.e the text on
 "Chennai Metropolitan Area Expansion to 8848 sqkm" is classified into "Area" which is the topranked central vertex

436. (FEATURE-DONE) Approximate SAT Solver update - commits 2 - 20 July 2017
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(*) Increased number of clauses and variables to 16 and iterated for ~3100 random CNF formulae.
(*) Following are the MaxSAT percentages after ~3100 iterations:
Percentage of CNFs satisfied so far: 69.1020276794
Average Percentage of Clauses per CNF satisfied: 97.6122465401
(*) Previous values are quite close to 14 clauses and variables iterations done previously.

Lovasz Local Lemma bound for 16 clauses all having common literals:
= (1-1/[e(16)])^(16)  > ~68.9233868%
and average percentage of clauses satisfied after 3100 iterations far exceeds this bound at 97.61%

Commercially available SAT solvers (exact NP-complete decision tree evaluation based) usually scale to millions of clauses and variables.Though
this approximate polynomial time SAT solver does not have similar advantage, yet the huge percentage of clauses satisfied in repetitive iterations does seem to have a lurking theoretical reason. Infact this is symmetry breaking solver having a sharp threshold phase transition which tries to translate a system of equations over reals in [0,1] to discrete boolean CNF formulae(value below 0.5 is 0 and above 0.5 is 1). Hardness of Approximation and UGC prohibit polytime approximations unless P=NP. 98% satisfied clauses could imply 100/98=(1 + 0.020408163) approximation where epsilon=0.020408163. This has to be corroborated for millions of clauses and variables in least-squares and requires high performance computing.

Random number generator used in generating random CNF clauses is based on /dev/random and hardware generated entropy. This CNF SAT solver depends on linux randomness to simulate pseudorandomness and create permutations of CNFs. Accuracy of previous convergence figures therefore might depend on if the CNFs are pseudorandom (e.g k-wise independent for k variables - when k increases to infinity independence may have infinitesimal probability).

438. (THEORY) Tight Hamiltonian Cycles and Independent Sets in ThoughtNet Hypergraph for Social Networks - related to 40,222,229,295,351,418,
420 and other sections on ThoughtNet - 25 July 2017 and 28 July 2017
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Theoretical description of ThoughtNet Hypergraph as basis for evocative thought and text analysis is mentioned previously. Hypergraph with 3 vertices per edge (3-uniform) and number of vertices n > n0, and minimum degree > n/2 + epsilon*n is guaranteed to have atleast one tight hamiltonian cycle from [Rodl,Rucinski,Szemeredi] theorem. Tight Hamiltonian Cycles have set of maximum vertex overlapping hyperedges. If complete universal knowledge is represented as 3-uniform ThoughtNet (infinite), this ensures all the concepts in universe are connected in a tight hamiltonian. Social media networks are also generalizable to hypergraphs (though tradition is to model as graphs having network flow). This can be simulated by ThoughtNet index - streamed social media tweets/posts/shares/likes are updated in ThoughtNet (non-planar) and each class stack vertex (e.g genre of people) could be part of multiple hyperedges (e.g events involving people) and each hyperedge can span multiple class stack vertices. Independent sets in this ThoughtNet Hypergraph are set of vertices e.g people who do not directly know each other. Centrality measures (e.g PageRank if there is one for hypergraph) on this hypergraph would elicit the social prestige/perception of individuals. It is worth quantifying how a vertex A is perceived by vertex B with no edge between them. This is a special case of centrality and gossip information flow - ratio of number of shortest paths between two vertices s,t in an independent set / number of all pair shortest paths. This estimates how two unknown vertices indirectly know each other.

Ranking people in social network can not be done in the same way as documents are ranked because of intrinsic merit anachronism paradox motivated by real world examples in earlier sections - merit precedes prestige while perception/prestige is a measure of merit. Bianconi-Barabasi network model deserves a mention here in which each node has an intrinsic fitness parameter in addition to incoming links. Examples in the reference 438.2 below explain how intrinsic fitness/merit are applied to search engine ranking algorithms. Earlier network models relied on temporal Preferential Attachment alone i.e node having high adjacency at time x are likely to have higher adjacency at time x+deltax. This is a transition from older First-Mover-Advantage (first starter always wins), Rich-Get-Richer to Fit-Get-Richer paradigm. Fitness of a social network profile (twitter/facebook etc.,) is a function of credentials mentioned in the profile and how fitness is quantified is specific to internal algorithm.

Barabási was interested in finding out how Google, a latecomer in the search engine market, became a top player. Google’s toppling of previous top search engines went against Barabási's BA model, which states that first mover has an advantage. In the scale-free network if a node appears first it will be most connected because it had the longest time to attract links. Bianconi's work showed that when fitness parameter is present, the "early bird" is not always the winner.[10] Bianconi and Barabási's research showed that fitness is what creates or breaks the hub. Google's superior PageRank algorithm helped them to beat other top players. Later on Facebook came and dethroned Google as Internet's most linked website. In all these cases fitness mattered which was first showed in Bianconi and Barabási's research. In 2001, Ginestra Bianconi and Albert-László Barabási published the model in the Europhysics Letters.[11] In another paper,[12] substituting fitness for energy, nodes for energy level and links for particles, Bianconi and Barabási was able to map the fitness model with Bose gas...."
438.3 Experience versus Talent shapes the web - http://www.pnas.org/content/105/37/13724.full - following simplistic theory provides intuition for it:
	Let M be the natural ability/merit/fitness of a vertex and E be the experience.

	Rate of change of experience of a social profile vertex is proportional to its intrinsic fitness and present experience.
	Previous assumption is a heuristic on real-life experiences - intrinsic fitness is a constant while experience changes with time.
	Thus at any time point, experiential learning depends on how naturally meritorious a person is and how much past experience is
	helpful in increasing experiential learning. (Might have some theoretical basis in Mistake bound in computational learning theory.
	Following formalises how a boolean function is learnt incrementally from a dataset over time by making mistakes and correcting them)

	dE/dt = kME
	=> dE = kME.dt
	=> dE/E = kM.dt
	=> log E = kMt + c
	=> E = e^(kMt+c)
	=> E = e^c * e^(kMt)
	=> Experience is exponentially related to talent/merit/fitness
	=> People with high natural ability amass same experience in less time compared to people with low merit
At time t=0, E = e^c which is equal to natural ability/merit/fitness M of a social profile vertex in Bianconi-Barabasi network model.
Therefore, E = M*e^(kMt). At t=0, experience equals merit and grows exponentially over time. But how to measure the fitness of a social profile for a human in terms of energy? What is the energy of a human social profile? Low energy syntactically implies low entropy and less chaotic nature of a profile. But real-life social profiles with high entropy do attract huge links. Previous derivation assumes natural talent is defined in terms of numeric quantification of credentials (marks/grades/awards/publications/IQ/achievements) which is insufficient. For human resource analytics, sampling experience at each tenure change (academic/work) gets a snap of experience at that time. Usually experience is measured linearly in time in academics/industries often overlooking merit, but previous equation changes that notion and implies experience exponentially increases with time as a function of intrinsic merit. Also previous differential equation is a very naive definition of experience vs talent - adding more variables could make it reflect reality.

439. (FEATURE-DONE) Scheduler Analytics for VIRGO Linux Kernel - Commits - 31 July 2017 and 1,3 August 2017
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(*) As mentioned in NeuronRain FAQ at http://neuronrain-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/, analytics driven linux kernel scheduler
is the ideal application of machine learning within kernel. There are two options to go about:
(*) First is Application Layer Scheduling Analytics in which a python code for example, learns from linux kernel logs, /proc/<pid>/schedstat
and /proc/<pid>/sched data of CFS and exports key-value pairs on how to prioritize processes' nice values in /etc/kernel_analytics.conf. This config file is read by VIRGO Linux kernel_analytics module and exported kernelwide. Existing kernel scheduler code might require slight changes to read these variables periodically and change process priorities. There have been past efforts like Scheduler Activations which delink userspace threads and kernel threads by multiplexing M user threads onto N kernel threads and focus is on scheduling the userspace threads on kernel threads. But Linux kernel does not have support for Scheduler Activation and has 1:1 user:kernel thread ratio i.e there is no application thread library having scheduling support. This option would be ideally suited for prioritizing userspace threads by deep-learning from process perf data.
(*) Second is Kernel Layer Scheduling Analytics in which kernel has to make upcalls to userspace machine learning functions. This is quite impractical because kernel overhead and latency of scheduling increases and upcalls are usually discouraged for heavy processing. Moreover this adds a theoretical circularity too - upcall is made on the context of present kernel thread and who decides the priority of the upcall? This requires complete kernel level machine learning implementation (e.g Kernel has an independent replicated implementation of String library and does not depend on userspace GCC libraries). Major hurdle to implement machine learning in kernel is the lack of support for C in machine learning as most of the packages are in C++/Java/Python - e.g. how would Apache Spark cloud processing fit with in kernel?. Computational complexity of this scheduling is O(n*m) where m is the time spent per upcall in process priority classification by machine learning and n is the number of processes. This implies every process would have significant waiting time in queue and throughput takes a hit. Also this requires significant rewrite of kernel scheduler to setup upcalls, do userspace execve(), redirect standard error/output (fd_install) for logging userspace analytics etc., Userspace upcalls are already supported in VIRGO linux CPU/Memory/FileSystem kernel modules for executing user libraries from kernel. If upcall instead writes to /etc/kernel_analytics.conf file than communicating to kernel (using NetLink for example), this option is same as first one.
(*) Third option is to implement a separate kernel module with access to process waiting queue which loops in a kernel thread and does upcalls to userspace to classify the process priorities and notifies the scheduler on process priorities change asynchronously. But this option is same as first except it is done in kernel with upcalls and overkill while first is a downcall.

First option is chosen for time being because:
	- it is top-down
	- it does not interfere in existing scheduler code flow much
	- minimal code change is required in kernel scheduler e.g as a KConfig build parameter and can be #ifdef-ed
	- key-value pair variable mechanism is quite flexible and broadcast kernelwide
	- any interested module in kernel can make use of them not just scheduler
	- it is asynchronous while kernel layer scheduling is synchronous (scheduler has to wait to know priority for each process from userspace code)
	- second and third options are circuitous solutions compared to first one.
	- Languages other than C are not preferable in kernel (http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/c++/linus)
	- Key-Value pair protocol between userspace and kernelspace effectively tames language barriers between user and kernel spaces indirectly i.e this protocol is atleast as efficient as an inlined kernel code equivalent doing an upcall and computing the same pair 
	- Key-Value storage can also exist on a cloud too not necessarily in /etc/kernel_analytics.conf file thus transforming VIRGO kernel into a practical dynamic cloud OS kernel
	- first option is more suited for realtime kernels

#Scheduler Analytics for Linux Kernel:
#=====================================
# Following DeepLearning models learn from process perf variables - CPU, Memory, Context switches, Number of Threads and Nice data
# for each process id retrieved by psutil process iterator - BackPropagation, RecurrentLSTM
# RecurrentGRU and ConvolutionNetwork models learn software analytics neural networks from psutil process performance info
# Key value pairs learnt from these can be read by Linux Kernel Scheduler or anything else
# and suitably acted upon for changing the process priorities dynamically. Any kernel module can make an upcall to this userspace
# executable and dump the key-value pairs in /etc/kernel_analytics.conf. Presently the implementation is quite primitive and
# classifies the output layer of neural network into "Highest, Higher, High, Normal, Medium, Low, Lower and Lowest" priority classes
# in the format: <pid#deeplearningalgorithm>=<scheduled_priority_class>. Number of iterations has been set to 10 for all deep learning networks.
############################################################################################

Following is a simulation of how the key-value pair for repriotization from Scheduler Analytics could affect the kernel scheduler:
	(*) Linux kernel scheduler has the notion of jiffies - HZ - set of clock ticks - for time slicing processes
	(*) Each priority class has a red-black binary search tree based queue - deletion is O(1) and insertion is O(logN) after rebalancing such that longest root to leaf path is not more than twice longer than that of least root to leaf path
	(*) On receipt of repriotization analytics, kernel_analytics exports it kernelwide, scheduler reads this <pid>=<new_priority> key-value pair and removes <pid> from <old_priority> red-black tree and inserts in <new_priority> red-black tree.
	(*) Thus multiple red-black trees make a trade-off and rebalance periodically with no manual nice interventions - this deletion and insertion is O(logN)
	(*) Every repriotization is therefore O(logN).
	(*) In realtime bigdata processing of heavy load, priorities can change quite frequently. For m reprioritizations, scheduler incurs O(m*logN) time. But m can have maximum value equal to total number of processes and thus a multiple of N (number of processes per priority class) and thus effective worstcase cost is O(NlogN)

440. (THEORY) Social Networks, Money Flow Markets, Pricing Equilibrium, Centrality, Intrinsic versus Perceptive Valuations - 1 August 2017 and
11 August 2017
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flow of money in a network of buyers and sellers and pricing have been described in KingCobra design document - https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/kingcobra-github-code/blob/master/KingCobraDesignNotes.txt. Problem of relating intrinsic merit/fitness of an entity to perceptive judgements is essentially reducible to the problem of market equilibrium as below:
In a flow market digraph,there is a directed edge from a vertex b to vertex s of weight p where b is a buyer, s is a seller and p is the price offered by buyer b for s. There can be multiple b(i) edges incoming for a seller s offering different prices and multiple sellers s(i) can have incoming edges from a buyer b. Problem of determining fair price for seller s amounts to finding objective intrinsic merit/fitness of goods/services of s while incoming buyer edges are perceptive subjective market values (auction). Treating this as a link graph and applying Centrality measures like PageRank could identify most valued seller in terms of market perception. Thus the problem of intrinsic merit versus perception is ubiquitous and is not just restricted to internet(text, audio-visuals). Assuming Bose-Einstein Condensation in Flow Markets, fitness/merit is measured by least energy.Note of caution is the term "least energy" has multiple meanings depending on context and cannot be literally taken as least entropy. In flow markets, least energy seller could be one with best marketing abilities, quality, technical knowhow, qualifications etc.,

In money flow markets, each buyer i is allocated a good/service j of x(ij) units with utility u(ij) with price p(j). Objective is to maximimize the money weighted geometric mean of the product of utilities for all buyers. This has to satisfy Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of convex program i.e this money weighted geometric mean is a convex function (line connecting two points on the graph of a function is always above the graph - epigraph is convex) on a convex set (line connecting any two points in the set is within the set) and optimized subject to KKT conditions. Another algorithm is to construct a goods/services - buyers bipartite flow network with a source and sink. This network has edges weighted by prices from source to goods/services vertices and edges weighted by money from buyers vertices to sink. Mincuts of this network determine price equilibrium by maxflow algorithm.

Previous example is mooted to invoke the striking parallels between buyer versus seller price equilibrium and intrinsic merit versus perception equilibrium - Intrinsic value of a good/service is immutable while buyers' price requirements for same good/service vary; Similarly intrinsic merit of an entity is immutable while perception of an entity is subjective. By replacing price with merit in Convex Program and Maxflow algorithms, equilibrium state between intrinsic merit and perceived merit of a social profile vertex can be found. But still this does not lead to absolute intrinsic merit.

Convex Program for Market Equilibrium is defined as below:
	Maximize u(ij)^e(i) where buyer i has money e(i) at disposal
subject to:
	Total happiness of a customer = Sigma(u(ij)*x(ij)) where u(ij) is the utility buyer i gets from x(ij) units of good j

Following maps a Market to Merit equilibrium:
Intrinsic merit of a (corresponds to Seller) vertex is defined by a feature vector of merit variables. Buyers are perceivers. Each perceiver has a pre-allocated total perceived merit which is divided amongst the perceived vertices. The Convex Program for Equilibrium between intrinsic merit and perceived merit is:
	Maximize u(ij)^e(i) where perceiver i has total perceived merit e(i) at disposal and u(ij) is the utility perceiver i gets from merit variable j of a vertex
subject to:
	Total happiness of a perceiver = utility of i = Sigma(u(ij)*x(ij)) where u(ij) is the utility perceiver i gets from x(ij) units of merit variable j of a vertex
	and p(j) is the equilibrium perceived merit of a variable j
Solving the previous convex program results in an optimal merit vector (set of p(j)'s) and weights of merit variables (x(j)'s) which satisfies both perceiver and perceived.

This equilibrium is closely related to Nash Bargaining Problem which postulates existence of an agreement and disagreement point (a,b) in a set X in R^2 involving two players where a and b are utilities of the two players. Nash function of a point (a,b) is the maximum a*b. In the context of merit equilibrium, the equilibrium point (a,b) is in optimum distance between intrinsic merit and perceived merit and maximizes happiness utility of both perceiver and the perceived.

443. (THEORY) Mistake bound learning(MB), Experience and Intrinsic merit, Social Network Analytics - 2,3,11 August 2017 - related to 368, 438
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mistake bound learning, iteratively refines and converges from an initial hypothesis based on mistakes. PAC learning is also a kind of mistake bound learning.  Previously described differential equation relation between experience and intrinsic merit/fitness/natural talent can be theoretically formalised as below:

Let M be the intrinsic merit (correctness) of a boolean function hypothesised in the form of conjunctions and disjunctions. From the derivation
of experience(E) versus merit(M) as function of time(t):
	dE/dt = kME
	=> dE = kME.dt
	=> dE/E = kM.dt
	=> log E = kMt + c
	=> E = e^(kMt+c)
	=> E = M*e^(kMt)

If dE/dt is replaced by number of mistakes b1 made and corrected per time unit in MB model and E is replaced by total number of mistakes b2 made so far in hypothesis and corrected (experience is function of this in human context), learner's experiential learning converges in time t to some percentage error and number of mistakes done in time t , b2 = t*b1.
	=> E = M*e^(kMt)
	=> E = M*e^(kM*b2/b1)
Previous expression for experience depends both on intrinsic merit and mistakes made which is exactly required in human classification.

Traditionally mistake bounds are used only in learning boolean functions. Generalizing it to any functions and humans creates a generic definition of merit and experience irrespective of the entity involved. Assumption in the previous differential equation is delta increase in experience is proportional to existing experience and merit. Boolean function learning theory does not appear to have the concept of intrinsic merit or how learning accrued so far helps in further learning which is quite essential for classifying humans based on merit+experience in social networks and human resource analytics. In previous expression for mistake bounded experience, number of mistakes made b2 and b1 themselves could be a function of factors like IQ and EQ  e.g b1 = f(IQ,EQ) and b2 = g(IQ,EQ). Then experience becomes:
	=> E = M*e^(kM*g(IQ,EQ)/f(IQ,EQ))
If M=h(IQ):
	=> E = h(IQ)*e^(k*h(IQ)*g(IQ,EQ)/f(IQ,EQ))

It has to be mentioned here f is nothing but the first temporal derivative of g evaluated at time t i.e f = dg/dt.
	=> E = h(IQ)*e^(k*h(IQ)*g(IQ,EQ)/g'(IQ,EQ))

Alternatively, f and g can be substituted directly if known and integrable:
	g'(IQ,EQ) = k*h(IQ)*g(IQ,EQ)
	g'(IQ,EQ) = k*h(IQ)*g(IQ,EQ)
	log g(IQ,EQ) = k*M*t + c
	g(IQ,EQ) = h(IQ)*e^(k*h(IQ)*t)

Curiously, function g which depends on EQ has no equivalent in RHS except time duration t and a constant k. This is probably because time is measured in terms of mistakes in the integral above and EQ is function of mistakes. Intrinsic merit function M does not involve EQ because mistakes alone are usually emotive in the context of social profiles (bounded rationality) and merit must be independent of emotions and time. Previous definition of experience can be used as a ranking metric for human social profiles as below for comparison of two humans after evaluating h, g and g' for some time duration subject to disclaimer that follows:
	g(IQ1,EQ1) = h(IQ1)*e^(k*h(IQ1)*t1)
	g(IQ2,EQ2) = h(IQ2)*e^(k*h(IQ2)*t2)
Disclaimer: Previous model of merit based on IQ and EQ are purely presumptive and disputable because of lack of well-defined Bose-Einstein "least energy" counterpart for human profiles.

This model is quite generic and should apply to any computable function including boolean learnt by mistake bounds. For boolean function learning, this model implies total number of mistakes corrected at time t ("experience") depends exponentially on learning time i.e if the mistake bound learning algorithm is polynomial time in number of variables, number of mistakes corrected is exponential in number of variables. For learning 3CNFs polynomial time mistake bound in RHS implies exponential number of mistakes have been corrected (function g) in LHS but an existing result implies if polynomial time learning is possible for 3CNFs there is no polynomial time algorithm for SAT (section 368) (But, isn't correcting exponential number of mistakes in polynomial time a nemesis of SETH?).

Mistakes in the social networks context are proportional to bounded rationality of the human social profile vertices of the social network. Bounded rationality in turn arises by inability of a human being to make 100% correct decision because of cognitive, psychological, emotional, time limitations. Decision taken is termed satisfactory than optimal and such suboptimal decision is called satisficing. Thus emotional quotient and bounded rationality are related. Measuring emotional quotient (intelligence+emotions) than intelligence quotient (intelligence alone) in social network profiles is equivalent to quantifying the sentiments of social network tweets/wallposts/likes etc.,

Thus following equivalence is conspicuous: Emotional Quotient (proportional to) Bounded Rationality (proportional to) Sentiment polarity of Social profile data e.g obtained by Sentiwordnet sentiment analysis. This is an approximate estimation of mistake-prone-ness and applies to decision errors of voters in Condorcet Jury Theorem group decision circuit too.

BackPropagation is a mistake bound deep-learning algorithm refining a perceptron by trial and error iterations. Previous differential equation for experiential learning is equivalent to a time-evolving recursive mistake correction tree described below:
At time x, tree reaches level l(x). Each node in the tree is a corrected mistake and each mistake corrected at level l(x) is subtree root for n corrected mistakes in level l(x+1). Thus each level l(x) of the learning tree is the set of mistakes made at time x. In the language of NC-PRAM  circuit families, each node is a PRAM processor correcting a mistake. After time duration x, this learning tree has 2^x-1 nodes correcting exponential number of mistakes. In NC notation, if number of mistake correcting processors=2^x=n, depth of the circuit is O(logn) equal to learning time x. This is a hypothetical parallel learning algorithm in non-uniform NC. This recursive mistake correction tree is nothing but a translation of differential equation dE/dt=kME. Outdegree of each vertex (number of future mistakes corrected by a PRAM processor) is determined by merit M, and delta increase in learning is number of mistakes corrected at level l(x) after time x = M*2^(l(x)). This should apply to backpropagation weight update iterations because each error term is a mistake. Perceptrons are in TC=AC=NC which is same as previous PRAM recursive learning.

Caveat is the previous recursive mistake correction tree is not traditional bottom-up evaluation circuit but is top-down based on heuristic: mistake corrected at time x helps correcting n number of mistakes at time x+deltax inspired by a differential equation for experiential learning.It makes sense to define "least energy/fitness" of a social network profile vertex to be equal to function g above thereby sufficiently weighing both merit and experiential learning. Social networks fall into two classes: Professional(e.g LinkedIn/Stackoverflow/Quora/Academic Citation Networks) and Personal(e.g Facebook/Twitter/Instagram/Whatsapp). Aforementioned definition of least energy as function of merit and experience applies only to Professional social networks. Stackoverflow is a special case of professional social profile - users up or down vote answers to a question which is fame-driven and not merit-driven. Least energy in personal social networks is totally unrelated to merit and experience and should more or less quantify definition of fitness in Facebook mentioned in 438.5 - profile having high nett positive emotive sentiment evaluated from wallposts/tweets/likes/replies/retweets. Personal social networks are replete with spam,chutzpah,trolls,expletives,emojis,satires etc., requiring parsing/filtering in Sentiment Analysis. Reference 443.4 analyzes the Merit Versus Fame problem in academic citations which belongs to Professional social network category. In essence ranking humans on intrinsic merit is two-fold: 1) Merit-Experience ranking 2) Personal Emotive ranking. These two rankings need not coincide and define intrinsic fitness/least energy of a person in two disjoint contexts. In literature, fitness/least energy of a social profile vertex is not a point value but a probability distribution i.e probability of a vertex/person having an intrinsic merit random variable value. Let us assume that merit is defined as a vector of n dimensions as:
	M=<m1,m2,m3,...,mn> where each mi is the weight for a merit variable
For example, Probability distribution for merit/least energy/fitness can be defined as:
	Pr(M=mi) = mi/|M| where |M| is the L1 norm of M
	Sigma(Pr(M=mi)) = (m1 + m2 + m3 + ... mn) / |M| = 1
Continuous Probability distribution is the polynomial passing through above merit weight points.

In generic sense, previous recursive mistake correction tree need not be a binary tree but a graph: At any time point t, number of mistakes corrected by a social profile vertex thus far forms an evolving triangular region of experience E, and each corrected mistake vertex in this triangle causes some mistake to be corrected in a future trapezoidal region dE in time interval (t,t+dt) adjoining this triangle E weighted by intrinsic merit M. This intuitively captures the equation E = M*e^(kMt) (dE/dt = kME) and the paradigm "experience = learning from mistakes"

Each node is assigned an intrinsic fitness, which models its quality. The fitness of a node never changes. Each node belongs to two layers: a merit layer and a fame layer. In the former, fitness values are the sole drivers of the growth mechanism. In the fame layer, attachment is preferential, that is, the probability that a node receives a link from a newcomer is proportional to the total degree of that node, i.e., the sum of its degrees in both layers. For example, in the case of citation networks, the interpretation of the model is as follows. Two distinct types of citations can be discerned.  The first type—the meritocratic type—is when a scholar reads a paper, and cites it because of its content (a citation which would be given regardless of the number of citations that paper already has). Another type of citation is what we call fame-driven. A paper can become trendy, or well-known in some literature (particularly true for seminal papers which initiate a new subfield), and many citations that it receives would be solely due to its fame—i.e., current number of citations,..."

More specifically, if a vertex v has fitness f, then our analysis implies that its degree dv(t) at time t scales as dv(t) ∼  t^(c*f) , (1) where c is a global constant determined by the fitness distribution.  (The details are omitted from this extended abstract.) Hence, the logarithm of the degree of the vertices directly reflects their quality. We note in passing that this could suggest new directions in the design of ranking or recommendation algorithms...". Roughly this implies, fame in social networks is exponentially related to merit. Previous experience-versus-merit temporal identity strikingly coincides with this. Fame=dv(t)=t^(cf) can be rewritten as dv(t) = e^(cf*logt) which when constrasted against Experience E = M*e^(kMt), yields E=f*e^(cft) setting fitness f= Merit M and k=c. Similarity between degree of a vertex and experience by matching LHS of these 2 expressions is obvious i.e experience of vertex is proportional to its adjacency. This is intuitive because experience is gained after interacting with other vertices and correcting mistakes while judging them. Alternatively, Experiential Learning E can be defined in terms of time evolving degree of vertex :
	log(dv(t)) = cf*logt
	f=log(dv(t))/clog(t)
	Since f=M, E = M*e^(kMt) = log(dv(t)) * e^(klog(dv(t))*t/clogt) / clogt

Trana] - "... To motivate the definition of our procedure, we observe that in most real-world networks the nodes will have an attribute or an associated quantity that represents, in some way, the likelihood that other nodes in the network will connect to them. For example, in a citation network (see, e.g. [22]), the different nodes (i.e. papers) will have different propensities to attract links (i.e. citations). The various factors that contribute to the likelihood of a paper being cited could include the prominence of the author(s), the importance of the journal in which it is published, the apparent scientific merit of the work, the timeliness of the ideas contained in the paper, etc. Moreover, it is plausible that the overall quantity that determines the propensity of a paper to be cited depends essentially multiplicatively on such various factors. The multiplicative nature is likely in this case since if one or two of the factors happen to be very small, then the overall likelihood of a paper being cited is often also small, even when other factors are not small.  The case of Mendel’s work on genetics constitutes an exemplar of this – an unknown author and an obscure journal were enough to bury a fundamentally important scientific paper.  Motivated by this and the other examples, we consider it reasonable that in many complex networks each node will have associated to it a quantity, which represents the property of the node to attract links, and this quantity will be formed multiplicatively from a number of factors. That is, to any node i in the network there is associated a non-negative real number Fi , which is called the fitness of node i, and which is of the form Fi = product(fl) ,l=1 to L where each fl is non-negative and real. ..." - this multiplicative intrinsic merit is mapped to summation of logarithms of merit variables. Central Limit Theorem implies summation of random variables converge to a Gaussian irrespective of values of merit variables. Merit variables are dimesional projections of merit vector defined above. CLT also implies merit (social or linguistic) converges to a Gaussian as it were in real life - tails are entities with highest and lowest merit and modal is of maximum merit. Interestingly, this prohibits multimodal. It has to be noted here Recursive Gloss Overlap algorithm  computes the intrinsic merit of a text as a product of graph complexity merit variables (Section 4.6 of https://arxiv.org/abs/1006.4458, Section 5.6 of https://tac.nist.gov//publications/2010/participant.papers/CMI_IIT.proceedings.pdf).

444. (FEATURE-DONE) Scheduler Analytics Update - Commits - 10 August 2017
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(*) There is a problem in defining expected priorities in BackPropagation Neural Network output layer. This is necessary for
weight update to happen iteratively and to quantify error between expected and actual neural network output
(*) Output layer of BackPropagation is an indicator of process priority learnt by the perceptron.
(*) Previously expected priorities were hardcoded. This has been changed as below:
        (*) Set of processes currently running are clustered and stored in an input JSON file
        (*) This JSON dictionary has key-value pairs mapping a process class to its apriori expected priority
        (*) Scheduler Analytics loads this JSON and looks up the expected priority for each process executable by its process class
        (*) Presently process class is just a substring of the executable name
        (*) BackPropagation does string match of this process class to executable name and finds the expected priority from JSON dict
        (*) BackPropagation iteration updates the weights of all 3 layers
(*) Defining apriori class of a process is subjective and instead of substring of executable, an independent clustering algorithm having a
suitable distance function can be used to write the JSON classification of processes. For example, unix process groups are numerical classes of
 processes.
(*) Previous generation of JSON classes for processes and backpropagation weight update iteration is the first phase of analytics.
(*) In the second phase, weight-updated BackPropagation Neural Network takes as input runtime process statistics (CPU, Memory and Context Switches)
to predict the actual priority of a process belonging to the apriori class.
(*) This is a depth 2 tree evaluation:
        Static - apriori expected class of a process and BackPropagation iteration
        Dynamic - fine grained priority of a process within the previous static class by evaluating the multilayer neural network

Presently, input variables are per process CPU percentage, Memory percentage and ratio of involuntary context switches to total context switches. Involuntary context switches are usually number of pre-emptions by the scheduler on time-slice expiry and Voluntary context switches are number of system call and I/O pre-emptions.

Average Percentage of Clauses per CNF satisfied: 97.0161556215

From LLL, If p < 1/[e(d+1)] is the probability of an event (not satisfying a clause) :

449. (THEORY) Analysis of Error Upperbound for Approximate CNFSAT Solver based on Lovasz Local Lemma clause dependency digraph - 29 August 2017
,30 August 2017
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Probability of a clause being not satisfied from Lovasz Local Lemma:
	p < 1/(e(d+1))
Probability of a clause being satisfied:
	1-p > 1 - 1/(e(d+1))
Probability of all n clauses being satisfied (ExactSAT):
	(1-p)^n > [1 - 1/(e(d+1))]^n
Probability of some or none of the clauses being satisfied:
	1-(1-p)^n < 1 - [1 - 1/(e(d+1))]^n
If there are no overlaps, d=0:
	Probability of all n clauses being satisfied = (1-p)^n > [1 - 1/e]^n = [1 - 1/e]^n
	Probability of some or none of the clauses being satisfied = 1 - (1-p)^n < 1 - [1 - 1/e]^n

Probability of atleast k of n clauses being satisfied:
	Pr[#SATclauses >= k] = Pr[#SATclauses = k] + Pr[#SATclauses = k+1] + Pr[#SATclauses = k+2] + ... + Pr[#SATclauses = n]

	= (1-p)^k + (1-p)^(k+1) + ... + (1-p)^n

if q = 1-p:
	= q^k + q^(k+1) + ... + q^n
	= q^k * (1 + q + q^2 + ... + q^(n-k))  [Geometric series]
	= q^k (1 - q^(n-k+1)) / (1-q)
But from LLL, p < 1/e(d+1)
	q = 1 - p > (ed+e-1)/(ed+e) 

Substituting for q:
	[(ed+e-1)/(ed+e)]^k [1 - [(ed+e-1)/(ed+e)]^(n-k+1)]
	---------------------------------------
		1 - [(ed+e-1)/(ed+e)]

#################################################################
#Probability of atleast k of n clauses being satisfied:		#
#	[ed+e-1]^k [(ed+e)^(n-k+1) - [ed+e-1]^(n-k+1)]		#
#	---------------------------------------			#
#		 [(ed+e)^n]					#
#################################################################

if k=n:
	(ed+e-1)^n / (ed+e)^n

If overlap of variables across the clauses is huge, ed+e-1 ~ ed+e
Maximum overlap d is (n-1) i.e a clause has common variables across all other clauses

When d is maximum:
------------------
Lt (d -> n-1, n -> infinity) ((ed+e-1)/(ed+e))^n
	= [((e(n-1)+e-1)/(e(n-1) + e)]^n
	= [(en-e+e-1)/(en-e+e)]^n
	= [(en-1)/(en)]^n
	= [(1-1/ne)]^n
	= [1 - 0.3678/n]^n 
For infinite n:
	= e^(-0.3678)
Pr[#SATclauses = n]	= 69.22% 

When overlap is absent at d=0:
------------------------------
Pr[#SATclauses = n]	= (e-1)^n/e^n = (0.6321)^n -> 0 for huge n

When d=1 (minimum overlap):
---------------------------
Pr[#SATclauses = n] = [2e-1]^n / [2e]^n = [1-0.5/e]^n = (0.81606)^n -> 0 for huge n

=> When the number of variables overlapping across clauses tends to a huge number almost equal to number of clauses, the system of
linear equations obtained by relaxing each of the clauses are solved by least squares and probability of all clauses being satisfied tends 
to 69.22%.  High overlap of variables across clauses is the most probable occurrence in real world SAT solvers. If the overlap as random variable is uniformly distributed:
	Expected value of d = 1/(n-1) * (n-1)n/2 = n/2

For mean overlap of n/2 variables across clauses:
#################################################################
#Probability of atleast k of n clauses being satisfied:		#
#	[en/2+e-1]^k [(en/2+e)^(n-k+1) - [en/2+e-1]^(n-k+1)]	#
#	---------------------------------------			#
#		 [(en/2+e)^n]					#
#################################################################

When k=n:
	[en/2+e-1]^n 
	------------
	[en/2+e]^n

	= [1 - 0.7357888/(n+1)]^n > [1 - 0.7357888/n]^n
	= Lt (n->infinity) [1 - 0.735758882/n)]^n = e^-0.73578882   
	=> Pr[#SATclauses = n] > 47.91%

=> When the number of variables overlapping across clauses are uniformly distributed, Probability of all clauses being satisfied per random
3CNF is lowerbounded as 47.91% when number of clauses tend to infinity.
=> Caveat: This is an average case analysis of overlaps and best case analysis for number of clauses satisfied. This implies SAT is approximately solvable in polynomial time asymptotically in infinite if the overlaps are uniformly distributed. This is almost an 1/2-approximation in average overlap setting, similar to Christofides algorithm for TSP. This is not an abnormal appoximation and it does not outrageously contradict witnesses towards P != NP described earlier in this document.

Correction to Geometric distribution LLL estimate:
--------------------------------------------------
Previous bound assumes Pr[#SATclauses >= k] is geoemtric distribution. If k satisfying clauses are chosen from total n clauses in 3CNF, it is a tighter binomial distribution and not geometric.

=> Pr[#SATclauses >= k] = summation(nCl*(1-p)^l*(p)^(n-l)), l=k,k+1,k+2,...,n

If k=n/2, this summation is exactly same as Condorcet Jury Theorem where each clause in the 3CNF is a voter = probability of majority of the clauses are satisfied. Each satisfying clause is +1 vote and each rejecting clause is -1 vote. Condorcet Jury Theorem thus applies directly and Pr[#SATclauses >= k] tends to 1 if p > 1/2 and tends to 0 if p < 1/2. For p=0.5, Pr[#SATclauses >= k] = 0.5. From LLL, p=0.5 implies e*0.5*(d+1) > 1 (or) (d+1) > 2/e. For arbitrary values of k, computing closed form of binomial coefficient sum for Pr[#SATclauses >= k] requires hypergeometric functions.

When k=n:
---------
Pr[#SATclauses = n] = (1-p)^n
From LLL, ep(d+1) > 1 => p > 1/e(d+1) 
	1-p < 1 - 1/e(d+1)
	1-p < 1 - 0.36788/(d+1)
	(1-p)^n < (1 - 0.36788/(d+1))^n 

d=0, no overlaps:
-----------------
	Pr[#SATclauses=n] = (1-p)^n < (0.6321)^n which tends to 0 for huge number of clauses n.

d=n-1, maximum overlaps:
------------------------
	Pr[#SATclauses=n] = (1-p)^n < (1 - 0.36788/n)^n
	But Limit(n->infinity) (1 - 0.36788/n)^n = e^(-0.36788) = 0.692200241
	Pr[#SATclauses=n] < 69.22% for huge n.

d=n/2, expected overlaps in uniform distribution:
--------------------------------------------------
	Pr[#SATclauses=n] = (1 - 1/(e(n/2+1)))^n = (1 - 0.735758882/(n+2))^n
	0.735758882/(n+2) < 0.735758882/n
	(1 - 0.735758882/(n+2))^n > (1 - 0.735758882/n)^n
	As n->infinity, (1-0.73578882/(n+2)) > e^(-0.73578882) ~ 47.91%
	=> Pr[#SATclauses=n] > 47.91%

=> 97-98% satisfied clauses found in few hundred iterations above for upto 20 clauses and 20 variables should tend asymptotically to 69.22% if there are high overlaps, high number of clauses and variables. For average number of overlaps, Pr[#SATclauses=n] > 47.91% and does not rule out convergence to 98%. This can be substituted for k for probability that 98% clauses are satisfied as below: 
	Pr[#SATclauses >= 0.98n] = summation(nCl*(1-p)^l*(p)^(n-l)), l=k,k+1,k+2,...,n
This is tail bound for binomial distribution which is defined as:
	Pr[X >= k] <= e^(-nD(k/n || p)) 
where relative entropy D(k/n || p) = k/n log (k/np) + (1-k/n)log ((1-k/n)/(1-p))
But k/n = 0.98n/n = 0.98
=> D(k/n || p) = k/n log (k/np) + (1-k/n)log ((1-k/n)/(1-p)) = 0.98log(0.98/p) + 0.02log(0.02/(1-p))
=> Pr[X >= 0.98n] <= e^(-n*(0.98log(0.98/p) + 0.02log(0.02/(1-p)))) 
From LLL, p < 1/e(d+1). Substituting for p:
=> Pr[X >= 0.98n] <= e^(-n*(0.98log(0.98e(d+1)) + 0.02log(0.02(ed+e)/(ed+e-1)))) 
Lt(n->infinity) e^(-n*(0.98log(0.98e(d+1)) + 0.02log(0.02(ed+e)/(ed+e-1)))) = 0

Pr(#SATclauses <= n) <= e^(-(np-n)^2/2pn) by Chernoff bounds. From LLL, p < 1/e(d+1). For average number of overlaps d=n/2, Chernoff bound reduces to:
Pr(#SATclauses <= n) <= e^(-1/e) ~ 69.22% which coincides with maximum overlaps bound above.

Previous imply approximate CNF SAT solver by solving system of linear equations (= clauses relaxed to reals from binary) is a 0.6922-approximation.

(*) Least Squares lsqr() function has been replaced by recent lsmr() least square function mentioned to be faster.
(*) For 10 variables and 10 clauses for 54068 random 3CNF iterations following were the percentage of satisfied CNFs and clauses satisfied 
per CNF:
Percentage of CNFs satisfied so far: 79.6722706172
Average Percentage of Clauses per CNF satisfied: 97.6276609517
(*) Again the percentage of clauses satisfied per random 3CNF converges to ~98% after ~54000 random 3CNFs.
(*) The clauses are created by randomly choosing each literal and its negation independent of any other literal or clause and thus are identically, independently distributed. CNFs can repeat since this is not a permutation.
(*) Repetitive convergence of number of clauses satisfied per CNF to 98% is mysterious in varied clause-variable combinations. 
(*) Previous error bound analysis does not assume least squares and is based only on LLL. But Least Squares is about sum of squares of errors minimization i.e Error^2 = |Ax-b|^2 is minimized e.g A'Ax=A'b, partial first derivative of error set to 0. System of equations translated from each 3CNF is overdetermined or underdetermined mostly i.e number of variables and number of clauses are not equal.
(*) Motivation for least squares for boolean CNF is the relaxation achieved: An example assignment for a literal, 0.88 is inclined towards boolean 1 and 0.02 is inclined towards boolean 0. 
(*) Convergence to 98% implies probability of average number of clauses satisfied per 3CNF > 0.98n must be almost 0.
(*) Following Binomial Tail Bound:
Pr[#SATclauses >= 0.98n] <= e^(-n*(0.98log(0.98e(d+1)) + 0.02log(0.02(ed+e)/(ed+e-1)))) is maximized when there are no overlaps - d=0. 
Pr[#SATclauses >= 0.98n] <= e^(-n*(0.98log(0.98e) + 0.02log(0.02(e)/(e-1))))
Pr[#SATclauses >= 0.98n] <= e^(-n*(0.41701 - 0.02999)
Pr[#SATclauses >= 0.98n] <= e^(-n*0.38701) ~ 0 for large n.

and 3 September 2017
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Probabilistically Checkable Proof theorem implies it is NP-hard to find satisfiable instances or 7/8+epsilon satisfiable instance to 3SAT. There are Semidefinite Programming optimization algorithms for MAX3SAT which replace the clauses by an arithmetized polynomial for each literal. Sum of these polynomials or Sum of Squares (SOS) of these polynomials is optimized by Semidefinite decomposition. Positive literal x is replaced by (1-x)/2 and negation !x by (1+x)/2. Literal polynomials within each clause are multiplied. This is a polynomial over reals and is decomposed as XSX' > 0 i.e positive semi-definite. Values of these Sum and Sum of Squares polynomials (F) for an assignment to CNF (a) are equal to number of clauses violating an assignment. Semidefinite Program maximizes/minimizes the difference F(a)-e (thus maximizing or minimizing the number of violating clauses) where e is value of F for assignment a. In this context, the striking 98% convergence for percentage of clauses satisfiedfor multiple clause-variable combinations for least squares/LSMR solver gains importance. It implies 7/8+epsilon=0.98 (or 0.875 + 0.105 = 0.98) satisfiable clauses per CNF if proved for all permutations of variables-clauses-overlaps (and that is a big if) implying P=NP. Atleast a convergence to 0.875 if not 0.98 would suffice.

Notation:
A' = Transpose of A
A^-1 = Inverse of A
E(A) = Expectation of A
p(A) = probability of A

Rounding in least squares solution to system of equations per CNF 3SAT fails if and only if binary assignment obtained by rounding does not satisfy the CNF while fractional assignment satisfies the system of equations for CNF. Least Square error is minimized by setting first partial derivative of error to zero:
	A'Ax = A'b
	=> x = (A'A)^-1*A'*b
Number of satisfied clauses in least squares is = tr(A(A'A)^-1*A'*b) because Ax-b is minimized.
Maximum value of tr(A(A'A)^-1*A'*b) is the maximum number of satisfied clauses
if tr(A(A'A)^-1*A'*b) > 7/8*number_of_clauses, then P=NP by PCP theorem.

Each matrix A corresponding to a CNF is a random variable - A is a random matrix (not necessarily square).
Expected value of A(A'A)^-1*A'*b where random matrix A belongs to some probability distribution = E(A(A'A)^-1*A'*b)
	E(A(A'A)^-1*A'*b) = b*E(A)*E((A'A)^-1)*E(A')
	E(A(A'A)^-1*A'*b) = b*E(A)*E((A'A)^-1)*E(A) because A and A' are bijections. 
	E(A(A'A)^-1*A'*b) = b*E(A)*E(A'A)*E(A) because A'A and (A'A)^-1 are bijections. 
	E(A(A'A)^-1*A'*b) = b*E(A)*E(A)*E(A')*E(A) by definition of product of expectations
	E(A(A'A)^-1*A'*b) = b*(E(A))^4
	E(A(A'A)^-1*A'*b) = b*(A*p(A))^4
Each random matrix for a random 3CNF has nm entries where n is number of variables and m is number of clauses. Each of nm literals is either a variable or its negation.

Probability of choosing a variable or its negation = 1/(2n) for n variables + n negations.
Probability of a random matrix A of mn entries = (1/(2n))^nm
	=> E(A(A'A)^-1*A'*b) = b(sigma(A(1/2n)^nm)^4 in uniform distribution.
			= b(1/(2n)^nm * sigma(A))^4 which sums up all 2^nm possible boolean matrices.
			= b(1/(2n)^mn * [ matrix of 2^(nm-1) for all entries ])^4
			= b * [ matrix of 2^(mn-1)/(2n)^nm for all entries ]^4

	For m clauses each being independent, Probability of a random 3CNF
		= (2nC3(1/2n)^3(1/2n)^(2n-3))^m
=================================================
	E(A(A'A)^-1*A'*b) = b * [ matrix of 2^(mn-1)/(2n)^nm for all entries ]^4  (1,m) * (m*n, n*m, m*n, n*m)
			= b * [ matrix of n*2^(2nm-2)/(2n)^2mn for all entries ]^2  (1,m) * (m*m, m*m)
			= b * [ matrix of m*n^2*2^(2nm-2)/(2n)^2mn for all entries ] (1,m) * (m*m) 
			= [ matrix of m^2*n^2*2^(2nm-2)/(2n)^2mn for all entries ] (1,m)
	Trace of this expected matrix is the expected number of clauses that can be satisfied by least squares in uniform distribution:
			= m^3*n^2*2^(2nm-2)/(2n)^2mn
	if number of clauses to be satisfied <= m, m^3*n^2*2^(2nm-2) <= m*(2n)^2mn
			=> m^2*n^2*2^(2nm-2) <= (2n)^2nm
	which is obvious because (2n)^(2mn) grows faster.
			=> m^2*n^2*2^2nm <= 4 * 2^2nm * n^2nm
			=> m^2*n^2 <= 4 * n^2nm
	For all m clauses to be satisfied, this must be an equality:
			m^2 = 4 * n^2(nm-1)
	if m=n (number of clauses = number of variables), all clauses are satisfied if:
			n^2 = 4 * n^(n^2-1)
			n^2/4 = n^(n^2-1)
			=> log (n^2/4) = (n^2-1) log(n)
			=> log (n^2/4)/log(n) = (n^2-1)
	which is a contradiction because RHS grows faster.
=================================================
Alternatively, following simpler analysis leads to something more concrete:
	For minimum error x = (A'A)^-1*A'*b
	Ax=A(A'A)^-1*A'*b is maximum when A(A'A)^-1*A'*b = b
	=> A(A'A)^-1*A' = I
When A is square symmetric matrix (number of variables = number of clauses ) and A=A':
	=> A(AA)^-1*A = I
	=> Least squares perfectly solves system of equations for CNFSAT if matrix of clauses is symmetric and square i.e error is zero
Least squares thus solves a subset of NP-complete set of input 3CNFs i.e exactly solves a promise NP problem in deterministic polynomial time.

From previous definition of expected value of random matrix equivalent to a random 3SAT:
	E(A(A'A)^-1*A'*b) = b*(E(A))^4
Previous derivation of expected value of a random matrix is further simplified by a different definition of expectation:
	E(A) = [ matrix of E(x(i,j)) ] i.e each entry of the matrix is evaluated independently.
Let the probability of each entry x(i,j) of the random matrix = p. Each entry is a literal or its negation and can take 0 or 1 values.
	E(x(i,j)) = p
	=> E(A) = [ matrix of p for all entries ]
	=> b * (E(A))^4 = b*[ matrix of np^2 for all entries ]^2
			= b*[ matrix of m*n^2*p^4 for all entries ] 
			= [ matrix of m^2*n^2*p^4 for all entries ]
	E(A(A'A)^-1*A'*b) = [ matrix of m^2*n^2*p^4 for all entries ]
	Trace(E(A(A'A)^-1*A'*b)) = m^3*n^2*p^4 which has maximum value equal to number of clauses m
	=> m^3*n^2*p^4 <= m
	=> m^2*n^2*p^4 <= 1
	=> p^4 <= 1/(mn)^2
	=> p^2 <= 1/(mn)
	=> p <= 1/sqrt(mn)
This retrieves the probability distribution of the random 3SAT instances. 
If all clauses have to be satisfied (ExactSAT), p = 1/sqrt(mn).
In previous example iterations of the solver, number of clauses = number of variables i.e p = 1/n.
This differs from the uniform probability assumption 1/(2n) per literal in earlier derivations including the negations too.
The promise subset of NP solved exactly by least squares is defined by the set of all random 3CNFs created with each 
literal occurring with probability 1/n.

(*) Some debug statements have been included to print average probability of each literal's occurrence in random 3CNF.
(*) SATsolver has been re-executed with 20 clauses and 20 variables and probability of occurrence of each literal has been logged.
(*) This was necessitated to ascertain the pseudorandomness of the clauses and CNFs created.
(*) Average probability of a literal is less than previous estimate of 1/n = 1/20 = 0.05 for 100% satisfied clauses but still converges to usual 97% for 100 iterations.
(*) logs committed to testlogs/

455. (THEORY) Eigenvalues of Random Matrices, Riemann Zeta Function, MAXSAT ranking of merit, Promise problems and Some additional notes on CNFSAT solver scipy/numpy least squares implementation - 18 September 2017 - related to 24,432
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The set of random 3CNFs created by the solver is just a subset of all possible 3CNFs because all least squares API in SciPy require number of variables to be equal to number of clauses, and an exception is thrown at runtime if they are unequal. A better alternative for these API which works for any combination of number of clauses and variables has to be found and substituted in least square invocation (replacing lsqr()/lsmr()). This is a limitation of SciPy/NumPy and not the least squares algorithm. This makes it a Promise SAT solver and not the universal SAT solver for time being. Also for huge number of variables/clauses, both lsqr() and lsmr() functions slow down heavily and it is difficult to test on  low-end personal desktops. The most plausible reason for convergence of MaxSAT to ~98% for almost all executions so far is the promise nature of the problem and only subset of 3CNFs (number of clauses=number of variables) are solved. In above random matrix analysis, if number of variables=number of clauses, probability of choosing a literal (positive or negative) is 1/n which is also uniform if two sets of positive and negated literals each of size n are separately evaluated for probability (E(x(i,j)) = 0*1/n + 1*1/n). This also raises a question: Since promise-SAT instances are NP-complete,does solving promise-NP imply solving NP. Since least squares exactly solves this promise subset (square matrix of equal number of variables and clauses) when probability of choosing a literal is 1/n, percentage of clauses satisfied is ~98% which is close to 100% implying the probability of choosing a literal is slightly less than uniform 1/n. Exact average MaxSAT percentage of least squares solver can be analyzed only if there is a suitable alternative to SciPy/NumPy. Therefore this convergence still does not contradict P!=NP and PCP.

Earlier the problem of intrinsically ranking texts etc., based on merit has been reduced to a MAXSAT problem where each text document etc., satisfies a fixed or variable 3CNFSAT formed from merit variables (e.g textgraph complexity) and merit is ranked by percentage of clauses satisfied. All the quantified outcomes of intrinsic merit algorithms described in this document can be translated to merit variables e.g variable1 = 1 if graph tensor neuron merit > threshold else 0.

Random Matrix representation of random 3SAT instances throws up an unusual window into the realm of Riemann Zeta Functions. It has been known that non-trivial zeros of Riemann Zeta Functions and Eigenvectors of Random Matrices (N*N hermitian matrices) have something in common. This indicates a possibility of a connection between Riemann Zeta Function zeros and eigenvalues of Random Matrices for Random 3CNFs.

(*) Solve_SAT2() function has been changed to take both number of variables and clauses as parameters
(*) Bug in EquationsB creation has been fixed so that length of b equals number of clauses. This was causing dimension mismatch and incompatible
dimensions in LSMR and LSQR
(*) Logs for 18*16 clauses-variables random 3CNFs have been committed to testlogs/. MaxSAT percentage is ~96% after 1200 random CNF iterations
. Per literal probability is too less than 1/sqrt(mn) obtained from random matrix analysis and therefore converges much below 100%.

Average probability of a variable or negation: 0.047619047619
Probability per literal from Random Matrix Analysis of Least Squared (1/sqrt(mn)): 0.0487950036474
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From PCP theorem and [Hastad] inapproximability result based on it, if m^3*n^2*p^4 > 7/8*m then P=NP.
=> m^2*n^2*p^4 > 7/8
=> p^4 > 7/(8m^2n^2)
=> if p > 0.96716821/sqrt(m*n) then P=NP.

In previous iteration, y and sumfreq print the frequencies of literals chosen so far at random (which are almost evenly distributed) and observed average probability of choosing a literal is 0.047619 whereas the required Random Matrix analysis probability for exact SAT is somewhat higher at 0.048795. Substituting the observed probability 0.047619 for 21 variables and 20 clauses:
	Expected number of clauses satisfied = (20)^3*(21)^2*(0.047619)^4 = 18.1405 clauses or 90.7025%
implying the MaxSAT for 21 variables and 20 clauses converges to 90.7025% asymptotically ad infinitum.

The inequality m^3*n^2*p^4 > 7/8*m relates hardness and randomness because probability distribution for p is directly related to uniformity and k-wise independence of pseudorandom (number) generator for choosing a literal at random. Presently the randomness depends on linux PRNG. If there exists a pseudorandom number generator corresponding to probability p > 0.96716821/sqrt(m*n) then P=NP.

For a binary valued random variable X, bias(X) is defined as Pr(X=0)-Pr(X=1) <= epsilon. Epsilon biased pseudorandom generators (e-PRG) are functions G:{0,1}^l->{0,1}^n expanding seed of length l to a pseudorandom string of length n and for all subsets Si (which are random variables) of {0,1}^n, bias(Si) <= epsilon. For uniform distributions, bias of all subset random variables is zero excluding the empty set. This is equivalent to: Bias(UniformDistribution)-Bias(e-PRGDistribution) <= epsilon. For random matrix approximate SAT solver probability p, previous condition of probability of choosing a positive or negative literal in a random SAT, p > 0.96716821/sqrt(m*n) for P=NP to hold, differs from the uniform probability distribution 1/2n (assuming n variables and n negations of them). This implies an epsilon biased PRG of bias p-(1-p) = 2p-1 = [1.93433642/sqrt(m*n)] - 1 for all possible values of m and n, must exist for P=NP. PRG described in reference has bias (n-1)/2^l. Equating 2p-1 = (n-1)/2^l and solving for seed length l gives an expression of required seed length l in terms of number of clauses m.

Let Xi be the random variable for choosing the literal xi. If literal xi is chosen Xi=1, else Xi=0. Therefore bias(ePRG)=Pr(Xi=1)-Pr(Xi=0). But Pr(Xi=1) = p = 0.96716821/sqrt(m*n) for choosing a literal from random matrix analysis derived previously for 7/8 approximation to exist.

An example application of Epsilon biased Pseudorandom Generator in reference 457.1 below :
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=> bias(ePRG)=p-(1-p)=1.94/sqrt(m*n) - 1.
Equating this to the ePRG bias (n-1)/2^l:
=> (n-1)/2^l = [1.94/sqrt(m*n)] - 1
=> length of the seed l in ePRG = log([(n-1)*sqrt(m*n)]/[1.94-sqrt(m*n)]
Absurdity is for length of the seed to be valid logarithm, sqrt(m*n) < 1.94 => m*n < 4 which is possible only for m=1 and n=3, the trivial 1 clause 3SAT. This necessitates transforming previous into an inequality as below:
	2^2l * (1.94)^2
	----------------- < m
	n*[2^l + (n-1)]^2
For large n, inequality tends to a surd 0 < m.

An example application of Epsilon biased Pseudorandom Generator in reference 457.2 below :
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=> bias(ePRG)=p-(1-p)=1.94/sqrt(m*n) - 1.
Other ePRG (Mossel-Shpilka-Trevisan) bias 1/2^(kn/c^4) mentioned in the references relates m and n for random matrix CNF SAT solver bias as:
	(1.94)^2 * 2^(2kn/c^4)
	------------------------ < m
	n*(1 + 2^(kn/c^4))^2
For large n, inequality tends to a surd 0 < m.

Both these prescribe a relation between n and m for small n and for large number of variables both ePRGs fit to the random matrix CNF SAT solver least squares bias for P=NP to hold. This implies there are random SAT instances for small n which might not create literals with probability 0.96716821/sqrt(m*n) a hindrance to conclude that P=NP and defining this small n is non-trivial.

Generic Epsilon biased Pseudorandom Generator of bias epsilon=1/x for x > 0:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Consider a fictitious Epsilon biased Pseudorandom Generator of bias epsilon=1/x, x > 0.
Lowerbounding bias:
	[1.94/sqrt(m*n)] - 1 <= 1/x
which reduces to:
	m >= (1.94)^2*x^2/[n*(x+1)^2]
This implies for any epsilon biased PRG, there exists number of clauses m below which Approximate SAT solver solves less than 7/8 fraction of the clauses. Largest possible value of m occurs for n=1 and x tending to infinity => m >= 1.94*1.94 (or) m >= 3.7636 i.e all CNF random SAT instances of 4 or less number of clauses can not be solved by least squares to get atleast 7/8-approximation.

Number of possible random k-SAT instances of m clauses and n variables = (nP3 * 2)^m because each clause has either a literal or its negation, not both. Variables and their negation form a set of ordered pairs (x1,x1'),(x2,x2'),...,(xn,xn') from which 3 ordered pairs are chosen per clause in nP3 ways and variable or its negation is chosen from each ordered pair thereby creating nP3 * 2 possible clauses. An m clause random 3SAT has thus (nP3 * 2)^m possibilities.

Number of possible 4 clause 3SATs are = (nP3 * 2)^4. Therefore fraction of random SAT instances not solvable for 7/8 approximation is:
	(nP3 * 2)^4		1
	-----------	=  -------------
	(nP3 * 2)^m	   (n*(n-1)*(n-2))^(m-4)
which is negligible for large m and n but non-trivial for small m and n.

Number of variables in 4 clause 3SAT is at the maximum 12. Thus this small subset can be solved in a constant time because m and n are fixed at 4 and 12 respectively.

[Caution: Previous derivation is still experimental with possible errors and assumes an epsilon PRG of bias atleast [1.94/sqrt(m*n)]-1 exists. If it indeed does, then it could imply P=NP and is in direct conflict with Majority version of XOR lemma - if numerator hardness does not cancel out - for hardness amplification described earlier and caveats therein which implies P != NP.]

458. (THEORY) Intrinsic Merit, Consensus Algorithms, Byzantine Failures and Level Playing Field - 23 September 2017
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So far Intrinsic merit of a text has been analyzed mostly in the context of connectedness and meaningfulness of it. It assumes a document text-graph (subgraph of an ontology like WordNet) obtained from the Ontology graph is implicitly agreed upon metric to measure merit i.e IM(text) = subgraph of Ontology, for some intrinsic merit algorithm IM. But the problem of "agreeing" by stakeholders on some process is itself a non-trivial Consensus Problem which has been overlooked so far. For example, merit measured by interview/examination question-answering or a competition requires all parties to agree upon the terms, conditions and rules a priori. This is widely studied problem of Agreement or Consensus. Consensus is defined by:
	* Agreement - all parties must agree on a correct process and its outcome
	* Validity - if all correct processes receive same input value,they must all output same value
	* Termination - all processes must eventually decide on an output value 
There are realworld consensus implementations - Google Chubby Lock Service based on Paxos Consensus Protocol, Bitcoin's Proof-of-work hyperledgering which appends transactions of a node to common log in a distributed timestamp server etc., ensuring all participants agree. As opposed to Majority voting which requires crossing just half-way mark in number of votes(>50%), Consensus requires complete agreement (=100%). Once 100% consensus is achieved on how to measure intrinsic merit, it is accepted as a standard and levels playing field for contestants. Consensus is most required in measuring human intrinsic merit than merit of documents. In other words, majority voting permits each voter to decide on his/her own volition. Each voter can have different decision function(boolean or non-boolean). But Consensus requires all voters to reach an agreement on a standardized decision function. Recursive Gloss Overlap algorithm and its enhancements to measure intrinsic merit from graph of text can be termed as "consensual" because connectedness implies meaningfulness by WordNet distance measures (Resnick, Wu-Palmer, Jiang-Conrath etc.,) and any text can be mapped to a subgraph of an ontology like WordNet and WordNet has been accepted as a consensus peer-reviewed standard.

Consensus can be impeded by presence of malicious nodes which spoof and send spurious votes known as Byzantine generals problem. A known result implies there is a consensus resilient to byzantine failures if number of faulty nodes is not above 33%.

459. (THEORY) Random Matrix Rounding for Least Squares Approximate CNFSAT Solver, Distinguisher for Pseudorandomness, Majority Hardness Lemma
- related to 318, 457 - 13 October 2017
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Existence of Pseudorandom generators (PRG) implies P != NP. Proof of this is by contradiction: If there exists a distinguisher which is able to discern perfect randomness from any PRG in polynomial time then existence of PRGs which fool a distinguisher is ruled out i.e Pr[A(x)=1]-Pr[A(G(s))=1] >> epsilon where x is a perfect random string in {0,1}^n , A is a distinguisher and G is a function extending a seed s of length m to n - G:{0,1}^m to {0,1}^n , m < n .

Majority Voting Hardness Lemma is an adaptation of Yao's XOR Lemma for hardness amplification from weak voting functions composed to Majority function (related to KRW Conjecture and Boolean Function Composition). Hardness of a boolean function is the error in approximating the function f by a boolean circuit C defined by probability Pr[f(x) != C(x)]. Majority Hardness Lemma implies hardness of the majority+votingfunction composition amplifies the hardness compared to individually weak voters and inverting this composition (MajorityInverse: finding who voted in favour or against) is extremely hard to approximate by a circuit and thus in average case could be an one-way function composition. Being one-way implies hard-to-distinguish PRGs can be constructed from this composition.

Random Matrix Rounding for Least Squares Approximate CNFSAT Solver in previous sections derives an expected probability of choosing a literal in a CNF for ExactSAT(when all clauses are satisfied). This expected random matrix probability (mentioned as RMLSQR henceforth: 1/sqrt(m*n)) corresponds to some hypothetical pseudorandom generator PRG1.

Probability of choosing a CNF by RMLSQR (there are 3m literals per 3CNF) = (1/[mn])^1.5m

Alternatively,number of all possible random 3CNF SATs of m clauses and n variables = (n * n * n)^m = n^(3m)

Probability of choosing a CNF from all possible n^(3m) random 3SATs in this uniform distribution is = (1/n)^3m

Thus there are two possible probability distributions for choosing a random 3SAT: (1/[mn])^1.5m required by Random Matrix rounding and (1/n)^3m for uniform. Probability distributions and Pseudorandom generators underlying these distributions are directly related.

If m=n(number of clauses and number of variables are equal):
------------------------------------------------------------
(1/[nn])^1.5n = (1/n)^3n and thus both RMLSQR and Uniform distributions are same implying similar pseudorandomness in RMLSQR and Uniform and distinguisher is fooled.This is a promise special case described earlier and does not suffice.

If m !=n e.g m >> n (this is most prevalent setting where number of clauses are huge and variables are relatively less):
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1/[mn])^1.5m < (1/n)^3m
(1/m)^1.5m * (1/n)^1.5m < (1/n)^1.5m * (1/n)^1.5m
(1/m)^1.5m < (1/n)^1.5m
1/m < 1/n
=> m > n

When number of clauses m differs from number of variables n, RMLSQR and Uniform distributions are dissimilar implying there are two different
randomness-es: PRG1 for RMLSQR and PRG2(or perfect randomness) for Uniform. Distinguisher for these two random generators has the probability of success defined by difference of the probability distributions for RMLSQR and Uniform = (1/n)^1.5m * [(1/n)^1.5m - (1/m)^1.5m] i.e when the number of clauses is high compared to number of variables, this difference is significant and distinguisher succeeds with high probability implying PRG1 is not pseudorandom and altogether PRGs may not exist at all. This coincides with > 87.5% of clauses getting satisfied breaking 7/8 barrier in average case and could be synonymous to Karloff-Zwick SDP relaxation algorithm for > 7/8 MAXSAT. This need not contradict majority+voterfunction composition hardness because MajorityInverse is a depth-2 #P-Complete counting problem (first step counts and inverts voter inputs to majority and second step counts and inverts assignments per voter and hardness is a function of sensitivity) and could be beyond P != NP purview (i.e. There could be pseudorandom generators indistinguishable only by an algorithm harder than NP).

461. (THEORY) Space-Filling, Random Close Packing, Bin Packing and Voter Decision Functions - 27 October 2017 - related to 135
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Parallel PRG and Cellular Automaton Algorithms for randomly filling a space with objects and their relevance to Linear Programming were described earlier. Space Filling is a problem studied in the field of Structural Topology. For example, density of spheres randomly packed into a container is approximately ~63.6% (reference below) which is exactly the problem solved by Parallel PRG and Cellular Automaton Randomized Space filling algorithms. This space filling problem can be formulated as a Voter Constraint Satisfaction Problem. Variant of Space filling is the NP-hard Packing problem where set of items of variable sizes have to be packed into set of bins of same volume by minimizing number of bins whereas Space filling has just one container and items are of similar sizes and random close packing converges to a fixed density percentage. If set of items in a random close packing within a container are equivalent to satisfied clauses (having same number of variables) of a Voter Decision Function, this topology result implies not more than ~V*63.6% of clauses (where V is the volume of container) can be satisfied per candidate(MAXSAT). Each n-sphere can be mapped to a  satisfied clause of n variables (each variable corresponds to a bounded length equal to diameter of n-sphere on a dimension of the n-space).

462. (THEORY) Reduction from Random Close Packing to CNFSAT - related to 461 - 30 October 2017
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each random close pack after a random shuffle shifts the centre of an n-sphere. Set of all possible centroids of an n-sphere in each random close pack are connected in a clause by disjunctions. There are as many clauses as number of n-spheres connected by conjunctions. For example,if R1,R2,R3,...  are random close packs and n-spheres s1,s2,s3,... are constituents of these packs R1,R2,R3,... , Centroid of n-sphere si = Cik is different for each Rk i.e n-sphere si can exist on any of these possible centroids which implies disjunction Ci1 V Ci2 V ... for locations of n-sphere si in Random Close Packs R1,R2,R3,.... This creates one clause per n-sphere. For all n-spheres packed in container at random, following conjunction of clauses for all n-spheres completes the reduction:
	(C11 V C12 V C13 ...) /\ (C21 V C22 V C32 ...) /\ (C31 V C32 V C33 ...) /\ ...
Each Cik is assumed to be boolean variable which is 1 if n-sphere si is located in centroid Cik in random close pack Rk, else 0.

Randomized Algorithm (Parallel PRG or Cellular Automaton) for this space filling random close pack finds a satisfying assignment to previous kSAT. This is not exactSAT because some spheres (clauses) might lie outside the container. Topological maximum limit of 63% for this random close
pack is the limit on density = Total Volume of Spheres (or) Total number of satisfied clauses / Volume of Container. As density increases , number of satisfied clauses increases. In other words, Total number of satisfied clauses = Volume of Container * PackingDensity = V*0.636. What Volume of Container translates to in the context of CNFs is open to interpretation - it might depend on the maximum-minimum range of centroid dimensions.

Filling the space within the container by n-spheres in parallel monte carlo random choice of centroids, simulates many natural parallel processes e.g shaking a container filled with equal sized balls. Parallel PRG and Cellular Automaton algorithms are for these special settings of random close packing (wherein size of the ball is infinitesimally finite) which are BPP/BPNC/RNC randomized algorithms to find a random close pack assignment to the previous kSAT. Each literal in this random close pack SAT is not just a centroid but also covers circular space around it of finite constant radius. Considering the usual example - shaking a container having closely packed balls: Every successive shake of the container creates an assignment to the kSAT. Formulating this kSAT requires prior knowledge of all possible centroid tuples which could be infinite. If shaking is of constant or polynomial time, churning out successive assignments to previous kSAT is surprisingly not hard. Also previous kSAT does not have overlapping literals across clauses.

465. (THEORY) Discrete Hyperbolic Computational Geometric Factorization, Chvatal Art Gallery Theorem
 and Parallel Tiling - 6 November 2017, 8 November 2017 - related to 34
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chvatal Art Gallery Theorem states for floodlighting an art gallery shaped as n-polygon, floor(n/3) guards are sufficient. There is a graph theoretic proof of this by [Fisk]. Discrete Hyperbolic Factorization requires pixelation of continuous hyperbolic curve as set of contiguous tiles (array of pixels). This computational geometric standard pixelation creates a polygon surrounding hyperbola of 4*(number_of_factors + 1) sides. This is because there are (number_of_factors + 1) pixelated rectangles in the polygon and each rectangle of the polygon has 4 sides. From Chvtal art gallery theorem 4/3 * (number_of_factors + 1) guards are sufficient to cover this polygon. This optimum number of guards is approximately the minimum number of parallel processors (PRAMs) required for tiling (pixelation) pre-processing step. Once these tiles are created in parallel, parallel sorting requires O(logN) time and post-processing binary search is also O(logN) - If there is a parallel binary search algorithm this could be sub-logarithmic. Assumption made previously is each guard has only vertical and horizontal 90 degree visibility.

As opposed to polygon pixelation, if the hyperbolic curve is discretized into set of line segments by plain rounding off creating a line segment for each interval [N/x, N/(x+1)], lower envelope of this set of segments is the list of endpoints of segments and there are no overlaps - segments meet only at endpoints. Number of line segments is twice the number of factors of N or O(loglogN). Computing lower envelope in parallel is equivalent to tiling in parallel. Lower envelope can be computed in parallel by CREW PRAM in O(logN) time and O(NlogN) operations.

467. (THEORY) Random Matrix Rounding for CNFSAT Solver, Blum-Micali PRG, Distinguisher for Pseudorandomness - 10 November 2017 -
related to 459
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Blum-Micali PRG depends on intractability of Discrete Logarithm f(x)=g^x mod p for primes p,g and group element x. Blum-Micali PRG creates
sequences of (f(x), f^2(x), f^3(x), ...) by composition of f and computes stream of bits by hard-core boolean predicate function b(.) - (b(f(x)), b(f^2(x)), ...) which is sequence of unpredictable pseudorandom bits. In Random Matrix Rounding for CNFSAT solver by least squares, probability of choosing a literal xn  = probability of the bit stream (b(f(x)),b(f^2(x)), ...) corresponding to binary encoding of n.

Probability of choosing a CNF by RMLSQR probability (p=1/sqrt(mn) and there are 3m literals per 3CNF) = (1/[mn])^1.5m
Probability of choosing a CNF from all possible n^(3m) random 3SATs in uniform distribution is = (1/n)^3m

Inverse of RMLSQR probability = (mn)^1.5m is the expected number of pseudorandom binary strings churned out by PRG before a required 3SAT is found.
Inverse of uniform probability = n^3m is the expected number of pseudorandom binary strings churned out by PRG before required 3SAT is found.

Distinguisher for these 2 distributions iterates through both sequences of bitstreams and prints "RMLSQR" if match occurs in (mn)^1.5m expected number of iterations else prints "Uniform". This requires exponential time in number of clauses.

From PCP [Hastad] inapproximability result and previous Random Matrix analysis for approximate CNFSATSolver, if m^3*n^2*p^4 > 7/8*m then P=NP i.e. if p > 0.96716821/sqrt(m*n) then P=NP. For the previous distinguisher, this requires (mn)^1.5m / (0.96716821)^3m exponential iterations. From condition for P=NP, this number of iterations has to be polynomial for efficient distinguishing of a PRG from perfect random sequence, which is a contradiction.

Jones-Sato-Wada-Wiens Theorem proves existence of a polynomial in 25 degree-26 variables which has values equal to set of all primes. This relates to Prime-Composite Function Complementation - Jones-Sato-Wada-Wiens polynomial is a complement function of set of composites which are formalized by unique factorization theorem. This is special case of Matiyasevich-Davis-Robinson-Putnam Theorem which proves any recursively enumerable set accepted by a Turing machine is equivalent to a polynomial accepting the elements of the set. Another closely related problem is: Does there exist a prime between two integers p=xy and q=x(y+1). Prime number theorem states and proves number of primes less than N=O(N/logN).

Number of primes < p=xy:
	= c1*xy/logxy
Number of primes < q=(x+1)y:
	= c1*(x+1)y/log(x+1)y

Number of primes between p=xy and q=(x+1)y :
	= c1*(x+1)y/log(x+1)y - c1*xy/logxy

Assuming number of primes between p and q = c1*(x+1)y/log(x+1)y - c1*xy/logxy > 0:
	(x+1)y/log(x+1)y > xy/logxy
After reducing:
	log(xy) > x(log(x+1) - logx)
	log(xy) > xlog(x+1/x)
For large x:
	log(x+1/x) ~ log 1 = 0
=> 	log(xy) > 0
thus proving the assumption. This estimate of number of primes between two composites thus directly has bearing on discrepancy of this 2-colored (prime-composite) integer sequence where discrepancy is difference between number of elements of 2 colors in monochromatic arithmetic progressions. Ulam Spiral, which is sequence of integers written in concentric spiralling rectangle, has diagonals aligned along points of prime numbers described by polynomials. Rectangle of Ulam Spiral can be written as polynomial x(x+1) or x(x-1). Previous derivation on existence of primes between x(x+1) and x*x implies there is a prime diagonal. Ulam rectangle sequence for x(x+1) or x(x-1) is 1,2,4,6,9,12,16,20,25,30,36,42,...

Matiyasevich-Davis-Robinson-Putnam theorem implies every recursively enumerable set has a diophantine equation. Complement Function in several variables is nothing but a diophantine equation for the complement set by rewriting a diophantine as function in several variables. Thus concepts of Diophantine sets/equations and Complement functions are synonymous. Decidability of complement functions (https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.4102) is equivalent to decidability of diophantine equations. MRDP theorem requires every recursively enumerable set to have a diophantine equation and therefore to have a function for it. [There exists a set which is not recursively enumerable e.g set of subsets of infinite set]. Undecidability of Function Complementation follows from MRDP theorem because there exists a recursively enumerable set which is not computably recursive and hence has no algorithm (algorithms are computable recursive languages which do not loop and have yes/no halt on all inputs) i.e Undecidability of Hilbert's Tenth Problem applies directly to Undecidability of Function Complementation. In other words set of diophantines has cardinality greater than set of all computable recursive languages and therefore there exists a diophantine function for a complement set which cannot be computed by a Turing machine. This is one more proof of undecidability of complementation and simpler than Post Correspondence Problem based proof described earlier.

Definition:
----------
For a set S and subsets A,B of S, if {A,B} is a disjoint set cover of S and if A has a diophantine equation diophantine(A) (expressible as values of polynomial), then diophantine equation for B = diophantine(B), is the complement function of diophantine(A).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Theorem: Existence of Complement Diophantine Equation or Complement Function is Undecidable when neither of the complementary sets are recursive.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proof:
------
MRDP theorem for Hilbert's tenth problem implies every recursively enumerable set is expressible as values of a diophantine polynomial.

Possibility 1 - Generic - Both complementary sets A and B are recursively enumerable:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If both complementary sets A and B are recursively enumerable, they always have a diophantine polynomial - diophantine(A) and diophantine(B).
There is a known result which states: if set A and B=S-A are both recursively enumerable, then A is recursive. But there exists a recursively enumerable set B which is not recursive, for some complement A => There is no algorithm for construction of diophantine(B).

Possibility 2 - Special - One of the complementary sets A or B is recursively enumerable and the other is recursive:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Both A and B have a diophantine polynomial. If A is recursively enumerable but not recursive, there is a complement B (A=S-B) such that there is no algorithm for construction of diophantine(A).

Possibility 3 - Special - Both complementary sets A and B are recursive:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Both A and B are recursive and recursively enumerable => Both A and B have diophantine polynomials and both diophantine(A) and diophantine(B) can be constructed. There are many examples for this complementation: [Squares,PellEquation],[Composites/UniqueFactorizationDomain,Primes] etc.,

Possibility 4 - Special - Both complementary sets are non recursively enumerable:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Obviously both sets A and B are beyond Chomsky hierarchy and there is no algorithm for construction of diophantine(A) and diophantine(B)

Possibility 5 - Special - One of the complementary sets is recursively enumerable and the other is non recursively enumerable:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One of the sets A is recursively enumerable and thus has a diophantine polynomial. But there exists a complement B=S-A such that A is not recursive => There is no algorithm for construction of diophantine(A)

Proof in one line: Any set is a complementary set of some other set and thus any complementary set which is recursively enumerable but not recursive has a diophantine equation, and thus undecidable by an algorithm.

Construction of a complement function for complementary set:
------------------------------------------------------------
Construction of a complement function is to find a mapping function f defined as:
	f(0) = a1
	f(1) = a2
	f(2) = a3
	...
	f(n) = an
for a1,a2,a3,...,an in Diophantine complementary set, which is equivalent to definition of recursively enumerable total function. This enumeration can be written as a diophantine equation:
	f(x) - a = 0
Function f can internally be any mathematical function and can have additional parameters besides x. Finding the enumerated mapping previously is equivalent to solving an arbitrary diophantine f(x) - a = 0 i.e finding solutions to x and a which is Hilbert's Tenth Problem - MRDP theorem proves finding integer solutions to arbitrary Diophantine is undecidable. ArXiv version at https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.4102 mentions some algorithms for constructing a complement e.g Fourier series, Lambda calculus, Polynomial interpolation. Polynomial Reconstruction Problem also provides a polynomial approximation of the set and has origins in Error Correction and List Decoding. These algorithms apply only to recursive sets - complement function mappings are constructible only for recursive sets. This is intuitively obvious because a Turing Machine computing the previous mapping for a recursively enumerable set might loop for ever.

An important example for applicability of function complementation is ABC Conjecture which is defined in references below. Let S be the universal set of all possible integer triples (a,b,c). Set of coprime triples which have quality q(a,b,c) = log(c)/log(radical(abc)) > 1 + epsilon for all epsilon > 0 is the subset A of S. ABC conjecture states that there are only finitely many such triples for every epsilon > 0. Then the set B=S-A is the set of all triples which violate this criterion - sets A and B are complementary. Proving ABC Conjecture is equivalent to proving the violation of this criterion in the complement set B - there are infinite non-coprime triples for each epsilon > 0 which have q(a,b,c) > 1.This converts ABC conjecture from primal finiteness to its dual infiniteness.

[Equivalently A and B are Ramsey 2-coloring of S and diophantine polynomials for A and B(if it exists) are 2-coloring schemes]. Answer to this question is two-fold:
	(*) Is set B recursively enumerable? (There are sets which are not recursively enumerable e.g set of subsets of infinite set)
	(*) If set B is recursively enumerable, B has an equivalent diophantine polynomial. But there exists a set B which is enumerable but not computably recursive and there is no generic algorithm for constructing complement diphantine polynomial. Undecidability of Complementation implies finding 2-coloring scheme is also undecidable.
	(*) In both possibilities, there is a set which does not have a diophantine polynomial - there is a non-recursively enumerable set which is outside Chomsky-Schutzenberger Type-0,1,2,3 hierarchy and there is a recursively enumerable set which is not recursive computable by a Turing machine thus ruling out a generic procedure for finding 2-coloring schemes.
471.9 Goedel Incompleteness and MRDP theorem - https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel-incompleteness/#HilTenProMRDThe - "... Beginning in the early 1950s, Julia Robinson and Martin Davis worked on this problem, later joined by Hilary Putnam. As a result of their collaboration, the first important result in this direction was achieved. Call an equation “an exponential Diophantine equation” if it involves also exponentiation, as well as addition and multiplication (that is, one can have both constants and variables as exponents); naturally, the focus is still in the integer solutions. Davis, Putnam, and Robinson (1961), showed that the problem of solvability of exponential Diophantine equations is undecidable. In 1970, Yuri Matiyasevich added the final missing piece, and demonstrated that the problem of the solvability of Diophantine equations is undecidable. Hence the overall result is often called MRDP Theorem (for an exposition, see, e.g., Davis 1973; Matiyasevich 1993).  The essential technical achievement was that all semi-decidable (recursively enumerable) sets can be given a Diophantine representation, i.e., they can be represented by a simple formula of the form ∃x1…∃xn(s = t), where (s = t) is a Diophantine equation. More exactly, for any given recursively enumerable set S, there is a Diophantine equation (s(y, x1, … , xn) = t(y, x1, … , xn)) such that n ∈ S if and only if ∃x1…∃xn(s(n, x1, … , xn) = t(n, x1, … , xn)).  As there are semi-decidable (recursively enumerable) sets which are not decidable (recursive), the general conclusion follows immediately:
	MRDP Theorem
		There is no general method for deciding whether or not a given Diophantine equation has a solution. ..."
471.10 Special Case of Complement Functions and MRDP Theorem - http://www.logicmatters.net/resources/pdfs/MRDP.pdf - Section 3 (Diophantine equation for set of Primes) and Section 4 - Theorem 4.3 - "If a set K and its complement N-K are both recursively enumerable then K is recursive". But MRDP theorem implies all recursively enumerable sets are diophantine and because there exists a recursively enumerable set which is not recursive, there is no algorithm to find a diophantine polynomial whose values is a set and thus the general case procedure for complementation is undecidable. Rephrasing theorem 4.3, If a set K is diophantine(K is expressible as values of a polynomial) and the complement set N-K is also diophantine(N-K is expressible as values of a polynomial), then K is recursive(there exists an Yes/No halt Turing machine accepting K). It has to be observed here that diophantine equations for K and N-K are complement functions. This special case is for the converse direction: assuming 2 complementary sets are diophantine, then one of the two is computable by an algorithm. Quoted excerpts from Definition 4.1 - "...Definition 4.1. A set of numbers K is recursively enumerable iff it is (i) the range of a total recursive function – or equivalently, it is (ii) the domain of a partial recursive function.  What does this come to? Definition (i) says that K is recursively enumerable if there is an algorithmically computable (total) function f such that as you go through f(0), f(1), f(2), . . . you spit out values k0, k1, k2 . . . in K, with any member of K eventually appearing (perhaps with repetitions). The equivalent definition (ii) says that there is an algorithm such that the set of input numbers for which the algorithm halts is exactly the set of numbers in K ...". Partial recursive function is a primitive recursive function not necessarily defined for all inputs and computable by a Turing machine. Total recursive function is a partial recursive function which is defined for all inputs.

Note on Factorization Spark benchmarks

Following are approximate correlations of the observed numbers to the theoretical polylogarithmic time bound - exponents of logN (=number of bits) increase probably because number of parallel RAMs(cores) do not increase commensurate with the number of bits and is static dual core:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Finding factors of integer N by creating pixelated polygon for hyperbolic curve xy=N has great visual intuition. Similar algorithms already
exist in discrete geometry and computer graphics disciplines. Bresenham's Line drawing algorithm is a classic used still in vector graphics
which approximates a continuous line on a pixelated digital space. This approximation of continuous curves on digital space is called
Rastering. Tile segments of hyperbola in preprocessing step of factorization are found by solving for deltay in:
		xy = N
		(x+1)(y-deltay) = N
		xy - x*deltay + y - deltay = N
		y = deltay * (x+1)
		deltay = y/(x+1) for deltax=1
which is similar to Bresenham Line algorithm for finding next point to plot on raster. Tile segment (N/x, N/(x+1)) along y-axis is equal to
interval (y, y-(y/x+1)) on y-axis.

Tiling preprocessing phase of factorization embeds a continuous hyperbola in a grid of horizontal and vertical straight lines. Each horizontal
line corresponds to an integer in y-axis and vertical line to an integer in x-axis. Hyperbolic arc traverses the squares(pixels) of the grid.
Thus the polygon approximating the continuous hyperbola is the union of all squares(pixels) through which hyperbolic arc passes. Union of
squares create rectangular faces of the art gallery polygon vertices of which are the locations of the guards. Vertices of these rectangles
through which hyperbolic arc passes through are the factors.

Art Gallery Pixelated polygon approximating a hyperbola is a Planar Simple Line Graph (PSLG) where each side of the polygon is an edge in
PSLG. This PSLG has (number_of_factors + 1) rectangular faces which is O(loglogN). Vertices where two adjacent rectangular faces
meet are the factor points of N. Planar point location has to find these factor points. Geometric Ray Shooting Query for this is : "Find points of vertices where two rectangular faces of polygon meet". This ray shooting can be picturised as a line from origin intersecting the rastered hyperbolic polygon and multiple rays from a common origin are shot in parallel of various (0-90 degrees) angles.  O(loglogN) of these rays pass through the factor vertices. Number of rays required is proportional to length of the hyperbolic curve = O(N). Thus parallel ray shooting is a geometric sieve for factoring   and is an alternative to sorting and binary searching the hyperbolic tile segments.

There are O(loglogN) intersection points in hyperbolic polygon where sides meet. Thus factorization can be solved in NC assuming pixelated hyperbolic polygon already exists.

(*) This shell script unifies C++ tiling and PySpark factorization
(*) Known issues: Python tiling still differs from C++ tiling significantly. Changing the hardcoded tile arrays storage in C++ tiling
to malloc()-ed heap storage causes faulty tiling. There are only optimization issues which do not affect the factorization. Factorization
works well and more benchmarks were done e.g for integers 723 and 501. Numbers for these and past numbers are charted below
(*) Following profiling numbers along with previous benchmarks for 8,9,10 bits (14 November 2017) capture the trend in the exponent of logN 
(*) Gradual increase in exponent of number of bits because of static number of parallel RAMs (cores) is not quite steep from 
3-bit to 10-bit integers as one might expect. Integers of same bit numbers need almost equal duration to factorize which implies the exponent
could be a function of logN and not N. Htop shows equal loading of both cores of CPU and consumption is almost 100%+100%.
(*) Cloud computing is not exactly a parallel RAM but multiple cores are PRAMs having concurrent access to a shared memory. Nodes in
cloud have local memory processing too. Spark's Global State Variables (Accumulators) which are reflected across all cloud nodes are
software simulations of Parallel RAMs - same global state is concurrently accessed by CPUs of spark nodes. Present PySpark implementation
 does the sorting on accumulators. Binary search is not necessary because Maximum elements at the end of the k-merge sorting of globalmergetiles automatically have shuffled coordinates as factors in globalcoordinates accumulator. This shaves of additional O(logN). This optimization 
is an update to drafts in 34.1 and 34.2:

477. (THEORY) Computational Geometric Factorization - Tiling Optimizations - K-Merge Sort is dispensable and Local Tile Search is sufficient
- 21 November 2017
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Finding factor vertices in pixelated hyperbolic polygon is equivalent to geometric search query: "Is there a right turn followed by a
downturn in the polygon?". These turning points coinciding with hyperbolic arc are factor points. Number of rectangles in pixelated hyperbolic
polygon = O(loglogN). Each tile along y-axis in the polygon (array of pixels) is of length deltay = N/[x(x+1)]. Maximum number of tiles
in the pixelation can be derived as:
	xy=N
	(x+deltax)(y-deltay)=N
	=> xy + y*deltax - x*deltay - deltax*deltay = N
	But deltax = 1, 
	=> y - (x+1) deltay = 0
	deltay = y/(x+1) and y = N/x 
	=> N/x(x+1) = deltay > 1 [each tile should be of length atleast 1]
	N > x*x + x
	=> x = (sqrt(1 + 4N) - 1) / 2
	For large N, sqrt(1 + 4N) ~ sqrt(4N) = 2*sqrt(N)
	=> x ~ sqrt(N) for large N
Maximum number of tiles in the pixelation is O(sqrt(N)). If number of processors is O(sqrt(N)), each tile can be assigned to a processor and
tiling can be done in O(1) parallel time. Number of processors required can be reduced by having O(sqrt(N)/(logN)^c) processors. O(sqrt(N))
tiles can be created in O((logN)^c) total parallel time i.e in each iteration O(sqrt(N)/(logN)^c) tiles can be created in parallel by as many processors and there are O((logN)^c) iterations. Creating a tile in a processor is defined as assigning the tile interval ordered pair of coordinates (tilestart, tileend) to it where tilestart=(x, y1) and tileend=(x, y2). This tile segment interval is implicitly sorted ascending/descending in one of the axes and therefore can be locally binary searched. This does away with Global K-Merge Sort of the locally sorted tile segments. Because each tile is of length N/x(x+1), |y2-y1| = N/[x(x+1)]. If N exists in a tile segment then there exists a factor point (x,y) in the tile segment such that y1 < y < y2 and xy=N. Binary search per implicitly sorted tile segment is of O(log(N/[x(x+1)]) <= O(logN).

Thus factors can be found just by:
	477.1 Tiling in parallel requiring O((logN)^c) tile and O(sqrt(N)/(logN)^c) processors where number of tiles = O(sqrt(N))
	477.2 Local Binary Search per processor on each sorted tile of O(logN) time
and no k-merge sort is necessary.

Previous optimization reduces number of PRAMs by orders of (logN)^c but increases exponent of parallel time O((logN)^c). Bitonic K-merge sort is global and least parallel time though number of processors required is huge (yet in NC and work-time optimal). Bitonic K-merge sort doesnot require binary search because factors are in the forefront of the mergesorted and shuffled tile coordinates always.

478. (FEATURE-DONE and THEORY)  Computational Geometric Factorization and Parallel Tile Search Updates
- related to 34 and 477 - 22 November 2017
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(*) cpp-src/miscellaneous/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_Bitonic.cpp has been revamped and unnecessary code has been removed. Function names have been changed. NUMBER_OF_TILES has been declared as a macro and has to be manually changed and compiled to nearest power of 2 greater than number to factorize. Compilation and PySpark factorization is taken care of by shell script cpp-src/miscellaneous/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_Bitonic.sh
(*) New Spark python script python-src/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized.py has been added to repository. This is the parallel tile search optimization already mentioned in NeuronRain AsFer Design Document. Spark parallelize() distributes the tiles-coordinates array of ordered pairs as RDDs across cloud nodes and node prints the factor point in y-axis if x-axis matches the number to factorize. Spark parallelize() simulates the binary search on a local tile segment per PRAM processor. Presently binary search has not been implemented in tilesearch() function of foreach() Spark Action. This is because map/foreach functions act on a single element argument of a parallelized RDD.
(*) How Spark parallelizes a sequential datastructure on cloud nodes is equivalent to binary search on an array of length 1 which is a no-op.  Because of this parallize() of Spark has been assumed to be equivalent to a binary search.
(*) Benchmark numbers for two integers 1011 and 1013 with and without sorting have been committed to testlogs/ and Tiling time durations have also been captured on how well mere tile search optimizes as opposed to sorting.
(*) As evidenced from python-src/testlogs/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized.log.22November2017, tiling preprocessing is quite insignificant (<<1 sec) and tile search for 1011 and 1013 requires approximately 20 seconds while bitonic sorting duration for same numbers is ~16minutes (960 seconds) a speedup of almost 50x.
(*) Benchmarks for Local Tile Search obviate the requirement for k-merge sorting of pixelated hyperbolic tiles, if parallelism is huge.
(*) Following is the trade-off:
        - Bitonic K-merge sorting of tiles : binary search is not necessary but a tremendous performance drag and overkill, suitable for low number of PRAMs
        - Local tile search : binary search is necessary only per processor but requires relatively high number of PRAMs

(*) Binary Search has been implemented in Spark Tile Search Optimization by parallizing the set of intervals of pixelated hyperbolic arc.
(*) By this each tile interval can be binary searched in parallel to find the factor point with no
necessity for global k-merge sorting.
(*) Separate pixelation and tile interval file creation C++ source file has been added in cpp-src/miscellaneous
(*) Arrayless tile creation has been chosen and only intervals are written to a file suffixed as .tileintervals
(*) Shell script which compiles and executes the tile interval creation file and spark interval binary search script has been added.
(*) Invoking the shell script as:
	cpp-src/miscellaneous/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized.sh <number_to_factorize)
is sufficient to print the factors
(*) Following are benchmark numbers for factorizing few reasonably high bit integers. Removing K-Merge sort has significant effect on the

Factorization of 934323 (20-bit): real	8m20.017s (single core - local[1])
Factorization of 934323 (20-bit): real	7m37.958s (dual core - local[2])

Factorization of 1343231 (21-bit): real	10m49.218s (dual core - local[2])
 
(*) Above tile binary search numbers beat bitonic k-mergesort of tiles by many orders of magnitude 
(*) logs containing factors of above integers have been committed to testlogs/
(*) This optimization thus effectively supersedes mergesort of tiles and is thus a better PySpark implementation of Discrete Hyperbolic Factorization. 
----------------------------------------------

480. (FEATURE-DONE) Computation Geometric Factorization - Binary Search for Tiles - Benchmarks
- 24 November 2017
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Benchmark numbers for factoring 24 bit integer by Tile BinarySearch Optimization script have been committed to testlogs/ (single node cluster, dual core):

Factorization of 9333123 (24-bit):
---------------------------------
real    112m24.101s (Spark duration 12:21 to 14:02 = 101minutes = 6060seconds)
user    0m0.000s
sys     0m0.004s

Again binary search of tiles in parallel is way better than k-mergesort of tiles. Largest known numbers
widely used are 128-bit. Trend for different bits indicates, Spark cloud of few multicore nodes is
sufficient to factorize 128-bit integers in few minutes. Previous benchmark uses spark-default.conf files
from python-src/InterviewAlgorithm/ (2GB of heapspace)

481. (THEORY) Computational Geometric Factorization - Parallel Local Binary Search for Tiled Hyperbolic Arc - 27 November 2017
- Snir's Theorem for Parallel Search - related to 34,477
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Previous optimized factorization with no sorting and only local binary search per tile interval can achieve further speed-up (from logarithmic to sublogarithmic) if search of each locally sorted tile can be done in PRAMs. Snir's Theorem implies searching a table of sorted elements can be done in sublogarithmic O(logN/logp) time by p CREW PRAM processors.

Tiling preprocessing of hyperbolic arc creates O(N) tiles. [This is proportional to length of hyperbolic arc obtainable from elementary
calculus = DefiniteIntegral(sqrt(1 + [N^2/x^4]))]

Number of iterations = O((logN)^k)
Number of PRAMs = (N/(logN)^k)

Factorization in parallel has following algorithm:
while(iterations <= O((logN)^k))
{
	*) Assign N/(logN)^k tiles to N/(logN)^k PRAMs in parallel (O(1) parallel time because each interval tile in a global shared memory array can be accessed by PRAM id as index)
	*) Binary Search tile in each PRAM for factors (O(logN) parallel time which can be reduced to O(logN/logp) by parallel binary search from Snir's Theorem)
}

Previous loop totally is of [O(1) + O(logN)]*O((logN)^k) = O((logN)^(k+1)) parallel time.For minimum value of k=1, Factorization by parallel
local binary search of tiled hyperbolic arc, can be done in O((logN)^2) parallel time and O(N/logN) PRAM processors without k-mergesort. Assigning N/(logN)^k tiles to each of N/((logN)^k) PRAMs is of constant time assuming tile intervals are in a global shared memory state i.e PRAM is simulated by a cloud global distributed state - e.g. Spark Accumulators. Snir's Theorem implies O((logN)^2) could be optimized to
O(logN*logN/logp) in CREW PRAM.

486. (THEORY) Computational Geometric Factorization, Tile Search Optimization and Parallel Interval/Segment Search Trees - 5 December 2017
 and 22 December 2017 - related to 34, 481
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tile Search optimization for finding factors of an integer described earlier, binary-search set of intervals in parallel for factor point.
This is the classic segment/interval search tree problem in Computational Geometry. Segments/Intervals are 1-dimensional polygons and represented in a binary search tree. Query point and the containing interval are searched on this binary search tree. Sequential construction of interval/segment search tree needs O(nlogn) time. Searching each tile segment in parallel and searching an interval/segment tree in parallel for factor points are equivalent. There are parallel segment tree construction algorithms on Bulk Synchronous Parallel(BSP) model and as Distributed Segment Trees. Distributed Segment Trees are based on Distributed Hash Tables and insertion/retrieval of a key is based on keyspace partitioning and routing in the network i.e Each node in the network is assigned a subset of segment id(s) in a binary partitioned space. Insertion/Retrieval primitives hop through the network and find the matching node for the segment. Most cloud key-store implementations are distributed hash tables. Example: For inserting n keys in O(logN) time, number of hops has to be O(logN) per key and each key is inserted in parallel in O(1) time. Minimizing number of hops implies maximizing mean degree of a node in the network and is a trade-off.

Unique Prime Factorization of an integer N = p1^k1 * p2^k2 ... * pn*kn
This can be rewritten as:
	2^logN = 2^(k1*log(p1) + k2*log(p2) + ... + kn*log(pn))
=>	logN = (k1*log(p1) + k2*log(p2) + ... + kn*log(pn))
	SmallOmega(N) = number of distinct prime factors of N = O(loglogN) from Hardy-Ramanujan Theorem
	BigOmega(N) = number of prime factors including multiplicity = sum of prime powers = k1 + k2 + k3 + ... + kn
But	k1 + k2 + k3 + ... + kn < (k1*log(p1) + k2*log(p2) + ... + kn*log(pn)) = logN
=>	BigOmega(N) < logN
	BigOmega(N) = O(logN) [This is very high upperbound and not tight estimate]

Segment binary search tree representation of pixelated hyperbolic tile segments is described in references below.

Factorization algorithm for N based on Segment Tree Search is:
	(#) Construct Segment Tree of Pixelated Hyperbolic Segments in Parallel (O(logN) or between O((logN)^2) and O((logN)^3) depending on sorting)
	(#) Query the Segment Tree for factor points in O(k + logN) where k is the number of segment intervals to be reported having factor point N=pq. It is sufficient to report atleast 1 segment having factor point and thus k=1. Number of segments containing both prime and non-prime factor points is proportional to size of set of all subsets of distinct prime factors and multiplicity (SmallOmega and BigOmega). Geometric intuition for this is: By moving a sweepline across the x-y plane, factor points and segments containing them (which are nothing but all possible size 2 partitions of set of distinct prime factors which correspond to p and q in N=pq, where as Bell Number of this set is number of all possible partitions) are reached in sequence left-to-right sorted ascending. Size of set of all subsets of distinct prime factors = 2^SmallOmega(N) = 2^loglogN = logN. If multiplicity is taken into consideration, from the very high bound above number of sets of subsets can be as high as O(2^logN).

Thus there are 3 Computational Geometric Factorization algorithms described in this draft and all of them are PRAM algorithms and in NC requiring between O((logN)^2) and O((logN)^3) parallel time:
	(#) K-MergeSort and BinarySearch of Hyperbolic tile segments (mentioned in 34 - requires merge sort of tile intervals/segments)
	(#) Local Binary Search in parallel of hyperbolic tiles without K-MergeSort (mentioned in 481 - recent optimization, better than k-mergesort)
	(#) Segment Tree Representation and Binary Search of hyperbolic tile Segments (uses a classic datastructure, preprocessing is non-trivial and segment tree has to be constructed in parallel - requires merge sort of tile intervals/segments)

Note: First and Third factorization algorithms are equivalent because both involve sorting of pixelated hyperbolic tile segments. Second algorithm obviates sorting by assumption that each PRAM can locally do a binary search without involving peer PRAM processors. Theoretically all three have similar polylogarithmic (O(logN*logN) at best) runtime upperbounds. Second algorithm is better than First and Third probably because the constant involved in Big-O notation in second algorithm is very small compared to First and Third.

It is apt to mention the resemblance of K-MergeSort of Hyperbolic Tile segments and Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) of a string. Burrows-Wheeler Transform sorts all rotation permutations of a string, extracts the last index fr
om each sorted permutation, concatenates them into a transformed string which has co-located substrings. This co-location of similar substrings is invertible and useful for compression and indexes. K-MergeSort Computational Geometric Factorization merges and sorts concatenated tile segment strings, resulting in a sorted string which has
colocated similar factor points.

An Unsorted Search algorithm has been implemented in NeuronRain (Section 500) to locate a query point on an unsorted array of numbers, by representing the numbers as arrays of hashtables for each digit.This algorithm can find factors in the concatenation of merged pixelated hyperbolic tile segments with no requirement for sorting. But this involves hashtable preprocessing.

Length of each tile on x-axis can be derived from equating for N:
	xy = (x+delta)(y-1)
	delta = x/(y-1) = N/[y(y-1)]

Sum of lengths of all pixelated hyperbolic tiles along x-axis is the series:
	N/(1*2) + N/(2*3) + N/(3*4) + ...
But:
	N/(1*2) + N/(2*3) + N/(3*4) + ... < N/1 + N/2^2 + N/3^2 + ... < N + DefiniteIntegral_2_to_N(dx/x^2) = 1.5N-1
=> Sum of lengths of all pixelated hyperbolic tiles is upperbounded by 1.5N-1 or O(N)

Some more optimizations:
------------------------
[#] Sorting is required only if end points of two adjoined segments are in conflict (only some, not all, elements in next tile are greater than last element of the preceding tile). 

[Subsegment1] Elements of succeeding tile segment become bigger than last element in preceding tile segment if:
	xy < (x + delta)(y-1)
	xy < xy - x + delta(y-1)
	=> delta > x/(y-1)

[Subsegment2] Similarly first element in succeeding tile is bigger than last element in Subsegment1 if:
	(x+delta)y < (x + N/(y-1)(y-2))(y-1) 

Splitting each tile segment of length l into two subsegments of length delta and l-delta and binary searching two sets of concatenations of these split tile segments can find factors in O(logN) sequentially with no necessity for PRAMs if concatenation can be done in sequential in O(logN) time (tree of list concatenations can be done in parallel on PRAMs in O(logN) time, but doing sequential concatenation of lists in sublinear time is an open problem). In other words hyperbolic arc bow is broken into two concatenated tile segement sets and these two tile concatenations are searched.

[#] If the quadrant containing hyperbolic arc is partitioned by parallel ray shooting queries from origin, separated by angles proportional to location of factor points, there is no necessity for sorting. Number of primes factors are O(loglogN). Thus kloglogN ray shooting queries from origin pierce the hyperbolic arc bow in parallel. If angular spacing between ray shooting queries are approximately equal, following trigonometric expression gives the approximate prime factor for each ray angle:
        y(m) = SquareRoot(N/[tan(m*pi/(2*k*loglogN))]) - 1 for m=1,2,3,...,kloglogN
These are only approximate angles. Factors should lie in close proximity of the intersection points of these rays with in hyperbolic bow.

Leaves of the binary search segment tree are atomic elementary intervals created by start-end coordinates of segments. Internal nodes of the segment tree contain list of segments. Internal node n of segment tree has a segment [s1,s2] if and only if Interval(n) is a subset of [s1,s2] and Interval(parent(n)) is not a subset of [s1,s2] and n is closest to root. Stabbing Query "Which are the segments containing a point q?" is answered by traversing the segment search tree from root recursively and choosing one of the two child subtree intervals containing q at each level. In Computational Geometric Factorization, segment binary search tree stores the tile segments of pixelated hyperbola and stabbing query is "Which of the tile segments have the factorization point N=pq?" which is O(k+logN) and k is the O(loglogN) because number of tile segments containing N is exactly equal to number of factors of N which is loglogN from Hardy-Ramanujan Theorem. Thus finding all factor points is O(loglogN + logN). It has to be noted here this further optimizes the factorization algorithm by local binary search of tiles in parallel described earlier in 481. Loop in the algorithm is replaced by a segment tree of tile segments. But construction preprocessing time of segment search tree is O(NlogN) which requires a parallel tile segment tree construction in polylogarithmic time mentioned in references below - Thus segment tree construction + stabbing query for factor points is: O(logN^2 + loglogN + logN) = O((logN)^2) which is same as the time required in Factorization loop.

487. (THEORY) Thermodynamics Gas Diffusion Entropy Model of Information Diffusion in Social Networks and Text Graphs - 11 December 2017
- related to 383
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Second Law of Thermodynamics implies entropy of a closed system always increases. Gas diffusion in a closed chamber distributes molecules
at random with in the space of the chamber. Gas chamber is a 3-dimensional grid of volume N. If in initial state, all gas molecules were confined to a small fractional cubic volume, probability of finding m gas molecules in kN (k < 1) grid points is kNCm / NCm. As the fractional volume gets close to N (k is almost 1), gas molecules engulf the chamber. Increase in fractional volume facilitates increase in degrees of freedom. Entropy of this closed system is defined as clogN where c is Boltzmann constant. Diffusion of information in Social network graphs can be likened to gas diffusion in closed chamber and adjacent vertices of a social network node are the neigbouring grid points. In other words, social network graph is plotted as non-planar simple line graph in a 3-dimensional space and information diffuses along edges of this graph. Entropy of this system can then be defined as O(logV) where V is number of vertices. Probability of finding a diffused information in any fraction kV of the network follows previous Gas diffusion model = (kV)Ci/VCi where i is the total number of information units diffused among social network vertices. For text defintion graphs, this is nothing but Korner Entropy.

490. (THEORY) Generalization of Complementation Undecidability to Rationals(Q) and Reals(R) by H10(Hilbert Tenth Problem) and
Connection between ZF with Axiom of Choice (ZFC) and Complementation - related to 471 - 28 December 2017, 29 March 2018
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thus far Function Complementation described in drafts of this document are oriented towards set of natural numbers only - e.g Coloring of Integer Sequences, Diophantines Sets of Integers and associated Diophantine polynomials having Integer Solutions. As mentioned earlier, finding the map f from a diophantine set a={a1,a2,...,an} is equivalent to solving the diophantine f(x,a)=0 for unknown x and parameter a and f itself being an arbitrary unknown diophantine. Integer solutions to x in f(x,a)=0 creates the enumeration f(0)=a1,f(1)=a2,... which is the constructed complement map. But from MRDP theorem solving integer diophantine f(x,a)=0 is undecidable. MRDP theorem does not apply for set of reals which is uncountable/non-recursively-enumerable - Reals have cardinality 2^|N| where N is set of natural numbers (there are atleast two levels of infinities). Because any set of cardinality greater than set of natural integers are uncountable, reals cannot be enumerated as f(0),f(1),... [By Cantor diagonalization there exists a real between any two reals]. For reals, Sturm's and Tarski methods solve arbitrary diophantines for real solutions to unknowns and thus H10 is decidable for reals. But there are undecidable real diophantine problems which involve sine() function(details in references). Construction of complementation is not just about solving unknowns in a diophantine but to construct the diophantine itself which is harder problem than proving undecidability from H10. Constructing the complement diophantine by previous mapping procedure mandates x to be always a natural integer for enumerability/listability and existence of a corresponding diophantine for this enumerable set - f(0),f(1),f(2),... - once the mapping process terminates, interpolation can find the diophantine polynomial from the ordered pairs (x1,f(x1)),(x2,f(x2)),...,(xn,f(xn)). Undecidability of complement construction for recursively enumerable sets arises when mapping procedure itself is not recursive. Removing restriction that x has to be integer and admitting real solutions for a and x, makes f(x,a)=0 decidable.

Axiom of Choice: For set of sets S={s1,s2,s3,...} there exists a choice function C(si)=xi which chooses an element xi from every set si in S.

Following is a special case example of Axiom of Choice in Boolean Social Choice functions:
Depth-2 boolean function/circuit B leaves of which are sets s1,s2,s3,.... and nodes at level one are C(s1)=x1,C(s2)=x2,... for C(si) = 0 or 1 and si={si1,si2}, si1,si2 in {0,1}. Root is an AND/OR gate. For example C(si) is a boolean AND/OR function. Boolean complementation of C(si) flips the chosen element per each set si. This yields a complement choice function per set. If this example of Boolean Axiom of Choice complementation is generalized to any set and is True, S={C(s1),C(s2),C(s3),...,C(sn)} is a recursively enumerable set listed by function C and has a diophantine representation by MRDP theorem and its complement set created from complement choice function C' of C denoted by S'={C'(s1),C'(s2),C'(s3),...}. If this complement set S' is also recursively enumerable, then both sets S and S' are recursive. This implies choice functions C and C' are constructible and have a diophantine representation.

Disjoint Set Cover is also known as Exact Cover defined as subcollection S' of collection of subsets S of a universal set X, and each element in
 X is contained in exactly one subset in S'. S' is a disjoint collection and the exact set cover of X. Exact Cover problem is NP-complete and is
 solved by DLX Dancing Links algorithm. Complementary or Ramsey k-colored sets are created by Exact Set Cover.

Hilbert's Tenth Problem for Rationals (Q) is open. Some approaches to solving Diophantines over Q - defining integers via rationals i.e integers are definable in first order theory of rationals - have been mentioned in references.

490.12 Hilbert Tenth Problem for Rationals - https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2010/08/07/hilberts-tenth-over-the-rationals/ - "...One of the most celebrated such results is that deciding whether or not a polynomial {P(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_m)} has an integer solution is undecidable. This is the famous negative solution to Hilbert’s Tenth. An obvious question, which is still open, is what happens if we ask for solutions where the {x_1,x_2,\dots,x_m} are allowed to be rationals? This is open—I discussed it recently as a potential million dollar problem....An approach to proving that H10 extended to the rationals is also undecidable is to show that the integers are definable by a polynomial formula. Suppose \displaystyle  \exists y_1 \dots \exists y_n \ R(x,y_1,\dots,y_n) = 0 is true for a rational {x} if and only if {x} is actually an integer. Note, the quantifiers range over rationals. Then, we can transform a question about integers into a question about rationals—this would show that H10 for rationals is also undecidable. ..."

(#) This commit implements diophantine representation of an enumerable recursive set by Sum of Four squares solver
in SymPy.
(#) New function that enumerates each element x of the complement set and applies it as a parameter to Sum of Squares Diophantine solver
to obtain the quadruple (a,b,c,d) such that a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = x
(#) This is mostly partial recursive function and not necessarily a total recursive function(defined for all possible quadruples).
(#) logs for this have been committed to testlogs/
(#) SymPy has other diophantine solvers too which require more than one parameters.
(#) SymPy does not have exponential diophantine support yet which if available could construct an exponential diophantine for almost every
recursively enumerable set ('almost' because of MRDP theorem - there are diophantine equations for recursively enumerable non-recursive sets and undecidable)

Any partial function f:X - Y which maps a subset X' of X to Y, can be converted to a total function by mapping all elements in the unmapped complement domain set X - X' to an element y in a new extended codomain Y' = Y U {y} or an existing element in Y. This partial-turned-total function map can be interpolated to obtain a polynomial.

From previous result every recursive set can be represented by a diophantine in 13 unknowns. If each unknown has maximum limit l, then there are l^13 possible 13-tuples t(i) of unknowns which is the maximum cardinality of the effectively enumerable set - mapping is enumerated as f(t(0)),f(t(1)),...,f(t(l^13-1)). This kind of complementation has two phases:
	(*) first 13-tuples are found by a diophantine solver and
	(*) these tuples are listed as t(0),t(1),t(2),....

495. (THEORY) Factoring as a service - General Number Field Sieve on Amazon EC2 cloud - RSA 512 bit - Relevance to Computational
Geometric NC-PRAM-Multicore Factorization Theoretical O((logN)^2) bound - related to 481 - 9 January 2018
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Number field sieve has been implemented as Amazon EC2 cloud service. Benchmarks for RSA 512 bit achieve factorization in less than
4 hours applying CADO-NFS and MSieve NFS implementations optimized for Elastic Cloud. Instance type used is c4.8xlarge (each instance has two Intel Xeon E5-2666 v3 processor chips, with 36 vCPUs in a NUMA configuration with 60 GB of RAM) and maximum of 200 instances were in the cloud connected by Elastic Network Adapter(ENA). RSA 512 GNFS benchmark has some parallels in Computational Geometric Factorization - Most time intensive preprocessing step is to create tile segments in parallel by pixelating the hyperbolic arc. Presently this is implemented as SparkContext.parallelize(tilesegementslist) which creates tile segment RDDs in parallel on cloud reading tile segment array on flatfile. Ideally, each PRAM processor (assuming there are N/(logN)^k PRAMs) must read in a tile by computation and not from storage. For example in the algorithm mentioned in 481, p-th PRAM has to compute the tile segment interval (tilestart,tileend) locally in i-th iteration as tilestart=(x,N/x) and tileend=(x,N/x-N/x(x+1)) for x=(p+i*N/(logN)^k). Factoring 512 bit by Hyperbolic pixelation and sort-search of tiles theoretically requires constant*(512)^k parallel time units and 2^512/(512)^k PRAM processors. It has to be mentioned that real advantage of this Computational Geometric Factorization can be felt only for large integers on huge multicores and is by-and-large a theoretical fancy abiding by definition of NC ("Factorization is in NC") in the absence of a practical large scale cloud benchmark. Number of PRAMs required in definition of NC-PRAM equivalence is high even for work-optimal NC. Necessity of sorting the tile segments arises because successive segments though locally sorted ascending cannot be merged by splicing end-to-end directly because some elements in end of a segment could be larger than some elements in the beginning of next segment. Local tile search redresses this deficit.

As mentioned in previous section, reading tiles from storage in SparkContext.parallelize() is a serious bottleneck. In this commit, tile interval storage is obviated and each foreach() invokes a function which computes non-persisted tile interval locally and does binary search to print factors. SparkContext.parallelize() takes xrange() as argument. Python xrange() is an optimized implementation of list and returns XRange object.XRange object does not store all the elements in memory and is more like an iterator. A thirty bit integer has been factored and numbers are below:

Computational Geometric Factorization doable in O(logN^2) PRAM time in NC2, implies factoring can be made easy by parallelism and polylog depth circuits.

498.8 Polynomial Time Quantum Algorithm for Solving Pell's Equation - [Hallgren] - http://www.cse.psu.edu/~sjh26/pell.pdf - Integer Solutions to Pell's Equation reduce to Factoring - e.g Solving for x,y for known N in x^2 - Ny^2 = 1 factorizes N by rewriting as: (x^2 - 1) / y^2 = N => ((x+1)/y)((x-1)/y) = N. In this respect, Hallgren's algorithm is equivalent to Shor Quantum Factorization. Computational Geometric Factorization in NC-PRAM or Sequential Optimization in P could therefore imply Pell's equation is solvable by PRAM model and in NC or in P as follows:
	(x+1)/y = a
	(x-1)/y = b
	2/y = a-b for factors a,b of N.
	y = 2/a-b 
	=> (x+1) = 2a/(a-b)
	=> x = 2a/(a-b) - 1

500. (FEATURE-DONE) Searching Unsorted List of Numbers - Algorithm in GRAFIT Open Learning Implemented - 21 January 2018
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An algorithm to search list of numbers better than bruteforce search mentioned in GRAFIT Course Notes:
https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/Grafit/blob/master/course_material/ComputerScienceMiscellaneous/ComputerScienceMiscellaneous_CourseNotes.txt
has been implemented in NeuronRain AsFer.

This lifts one dimensional numbers to multidimensional tuples and creates hashtables for each dimension of tuple. Lookup for a query number is
lookup of each digit in query in these hash tables in succession. If all hash lookups succeed queried number exists in the unsorted list

This implementation pads each number with "#" so that it is right justified and maximum number of digits is stipulated.

Searching Unsorted lists is the most fundamental open research problem and this implementation uses Locality sensitive hashing as the hash table
. Python dictionaries are hash maps and not hash tables which support collisions. Each digit in query is lookedup for nearest neighbours and if
 there is a match digitmatch is set to True. Logical AND of all digit matches is returned as True/False.

501. (THEORY) Answer-Questioning (Reversal of Interview) and Recursive Gloss Overlap Dense Subgraph Classification - 21 January 2018
- related to 412, 420
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recursive Gloss Overlap Definition Graph of a text previously has been demonstrated to classify documents in unsupervised manner based on
dense subgraphs: centrality, k-cores, pageranks etc., Dense subgraphs of text graph extract the essence of an article and highlight the keywords
which may or may not be present in the document. Keywords not present in the document can be classes of a document because of the recursive
deep learning of definitions. From the keywords, a question or set of permutations of questions can be constructed which the text answers.
Relevance of Question depends on the relatedness e.g Tensor Neuron of all possible pairs of keyword class vertices.

Example:
--------
If a text graph of an academic research text has been classified in following word vertices of high core numbers
		[Prime, Factorization, Theorem, Composites, Diophantine, Polynomials,...]
in decreasing value of centrality/k-core/pagerank and pairwise Tensor Neuron potentials are ranked as below:
		Prime-Factorization = 0.34234
		Theorem-Composites=0.33333
		Diophantine-polynomials=0.221212
		... and so on
then question(s) can be constructed based on previous ranking of Tensor relatedness as:
		Does this article discuss relation between [Primes] and [Factorization]?
		....

502. (FEATURE-DONE) Scheduler Analytics - Interprocess Distance Computation by DictDiffer - 24 January 2018
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Representing OS Process Information as Feature Vectors has been mentioned as Software Scheduler Analytics usecase in
http://neuronrain-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
2. This commit implements a new python function which reads process info as a dictionary from psutils. Psutils has an option to read individual
process metrics or to read the dictionary in its entirety.
3. Psutils per-process dictionary has all the basic details pertaining to instantaneous resource consumptions of a process
4. These per-process features are collated in an array and are json.dump()-ed as strings in asfer.enterprise.encstr.scheduleranalytics file
which can be used as input by clustering/classification NeuronRain-AsFer C++ implementations.
5. logs for this have been committed to software_analytics/testlogs/DeepLearning_SchedulerAnalytics.log.24January2018
6. Distance between two process feature dictionaries/vectors are printed by DictDiffer which has been imported and length of the diff is
 the distance function between any two processes.

503. (FEATURE-DONE) Scheduler Analytics - Process kNN classification and K-Means clustering, Process Dict Hashing - 25 January 2018
(Only in NeuronRain Enterprise - GitHub)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. python-src/software_analytics/DeepLearning_SchedulerAnalytics.py has been updated to define a getHash() function similar to Streaming_<algorithm>.py implementations, which creates an MD5 hash of process psutils dictionary string. 
2. This hashing of dictionary is because of huge size of process dictionary storing of which requires few KBs for each process. Computing distance (Levenshtein) of these strings is again memory intensive.
3. DictDiffer distance implemented in python-src/software_analytics/DeepLearning_SchedulerAnalytics.py is not directly invocable in C++ and diff between process dictionary strings is also huge in KBs.
4. Succinct representation of process dictionary string - Fingerprinting - is therefore a necessity to optimize space. MD5 binary hash digest of the process dictionary string is written to python-src/software_analytics/asfer.enterprise.encstr.scheduleranalytics prefixed by process name and process id , instead of complete chunk.
5. cpp-src/asferkNNclustering.cpp and cpp-src/asferkmeansclustering.cpp are updated for EOF check and number of clusters has been increased to 10 in kNN classifier.
6. asfer binary has been rebuilt and asfer.conf has been updated to do clustering and classification.
7. process statistics dataset - cpp-src/asfer.enterprise.encstr, cpp-src/asfer.enterprise.encstr.clustered and cpp-src/asfer.enterprise.encstr.kNN have been updated.
8. asfer kNN classification and KMeans clustering has been executed on this encoded process statistics dataset 
9. logs have been committed to cpp-src/testlogs/asfer.SchedulerAnalytics.KMeansAndkNNClustering.log.25January2018 (Scheduler Analytics) and cpp-src/testlogs/asfer.SchedulerAnalytics.KMeansAndkNNClustering.log.25January2018 (kNN classification and KMeans clustering) - for 194 processes
10. logs for clustering and classification imply similar processes flock together - e.g excerpt from KMeans cluster logs show lot of kworkers in same cluster:

506. (THEORY) Computational Geometric Factorization - Feasibility of Sequential Optimization - related to 486 - 6 February 2018, 1 September 2018
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Doing away with Parallel RAMs in Computational Geometric Factorization by breaking the hyperbolic arc bow into two sets of tilesegments 
and searching their concatenations which are implicitly sorted ascending, has problems because concatenation of multiple tile segments may not be sublinear. Concatenating tile segments can be likened to concatenation of multiple strings. Concatenation of two strings can be done
in O(logN) time by using Rope Strings which are tree representations of strings (logarithmic in length of strings and not in number of
strings). But concatenation of multiple strings/tiles logarithmic time in number of strings is still open.

Following sequential optimization tries to find feasibility of doing Sequential Factorization without PRAMs and concatenation of tile segments:

number_to_factorize=N
factor_candidate=N/2

---------------------------
Loop for subsegment1 tree:
---------------------------
while(factor is not found)
{
	1. Find the tile segment/interval containing factor candidate.
	[2. Split the candidate tile segment to two subsegments - subsegment1 contains points which are less than previous segment's end point,subsegment2 contains points which are greater than previous segment's end point.]
	3. Binary Search each node in subsegment1 tree for factor points (p,q) (N=pq) - There are 3 possibilities:
	3.1 All points in this subsegment1 tree node are less than N => Binary Search has to be done on right subsegment1 subtree recursively, factor_candidate is updated
	3.2 All points in this subsegment1 tree node are greater than N => Search has to be done on left subsegment1 subtree recursively, factor_candidate is updated
	3.3 N is present in this subsegment1 tree node and factor point N=pq is found
}

---------------------------
Loop for subsegment2 tree:
---------------------------
while(factor is not found)
{
	4. Find the tile segment/interval containing factor candidate.
	[5. Split the candidate tile segment to two subsegments - subsegment1 contains points which are less than previous segment's end point,subsegment2 contains points which are greater than previous segment's end point.]
	6. Binary Search each node in subsegment2 tree for factor points (p,q) (N=pq) - There are 3 possibilities:
	6.1 All points in this subsegment2 tree node are less than N => Binary Search has to be done on right subsegment2 subtree recursively
	6.2 All points in this subsegment2 tree node are greater than N => Search has to be done on left subsegment2 subtree recursively
	6.3 N is present in this subsegment2 tree node and factor point N=pq is found
}

7.Above algorithm is Depth-2 Two Level Binary Search:
7.1) First binary search finds the subsegment node in subsegment trees in O(logN)
7.2) Second binary search searches within subsegment node in O(logN)
and thus requires O(logN*logN) sequential time.

8. Sets of subsegment1(s) and subsegment2(s) constitute 2 binary search trees of segments, but these two search trees are not physically created. Binary search of tile containing factor candidate dynamically creates treelike traversal.

9. Finding tile segment containing a factor candidate point is non-trivial planar point location problem in general. But Following algorithm finds the interval containing the point in O(1) time specific to hyperbolic pixelated tiling:
Sum of lengths of k consecutive hyperbolic pixelated tiles = N/(1*2) + N/(2*3) + N/(3*4) + ... + N/(k*(k+1))
	= N(1/1 - 1/2 + 1/2 - 1/3 + 1/3 - 1/4 + ... + 1/k - 1/(k+1))
	= N(1 - 1/(k+1))
	= Nk/(k+1)
Tile containing point x:
	Nk/(k+1) < x < N(k+1)/(k+2)
	k < x/(N-x)
integer round-off of k is the index of tile interval containing x.

10. Previous sequential optimization of O((logN)^2) though removes PRAMs, proves only that Factorization is in P. Computational geometric factorization by PRAMs is still a better result because it implies Factorization is in NC from PRAM-NC equivalence despite requirement of high number of parallel processors.

11. For each segment k in loops previously, 2 subsegments of it have following interval endpoints - (xleft,yleft,xright,yright):
	subsegment1:  (N/(k+2),(k+1),N/(k+2)+delta,(k+1))
	subsegment2:  (N/(k+2)+delta,(k+1),N/(k+1),(k+1))
and delta=N/((k+1)(k+2))

12. CAVEAT: Two factor points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) can equal by x1*y1=x2*y2 but these two points are located in different subsegments of different tiles because points within subsegment1 or subsegment2 of a tile segment have same y-coordinates. Previous inequality applies only to a binary search segment tree comprised of subsegment2(s) of all segments by implicit geometric spatial sortedness i.e end of subsegment2 in previous segment is less than start of subsegment2 in next segment. Set of subsegment1(s) need not be implicitly sorted and thus can not be searched by a segment tree constructed sequentially. This renders previous optimization feasible only to a subset of integers. Algorithms for Parallel RAM construction of segment tree described previously are therefore necessary to find factor points in polylogarithmic time and thus in NC and all these algorithms require parallel k-mergesort. This sequential algorithm has been mentioned only as an optimization.

--------------------------------------
13. Tile Summation and Wavelet trees:
--------------------------------------
Sum of lengths of first n tile segments of pixelated hyperbolic curve derived previously:
	N/[1*2] + N/[2*3] + ... + N/[n*(n+1)] = Nn/(n+1)
which can be equated to sum of distances between first m prime factors by Hardy-Ramanujan Theorem:
	Nn/(n+1) = mN/kloglogN

=> n = m/(kloglogN - m) = number of tiles till m-th prime factor. Sum of lengths (N/x(x+1) each) of these n tiles (=O(loglogN)) till m-th prime factor finds approximate m-th prime factor. Constructing wavelet tree for concatenated unsorted string of tile segments of epsilon radius around approximate factors and doing select(N) on the wavelet string finds atleast one factor location. Geometric intuition: Tile summations are hyperbolic pixel polygons and if vertices of this polygon - endpoints of concatenation - coincide with factor points on x-y axis grid, factors are found. Accuracy depends on precision of tile summation and this is only an optimization. If epsilon radius centered around each approximate prime factor is e, total length of concatenated unsorted tile for all prime factors is: O(2*e*loglogN). Sequential Construction and select() for wavelet tree for this string is:
        O(2eloglogN * log(2eloglogN)) + log(2eloglogN) = O(e*loglogN * log(e*loglogN)) + log(e*loglogN)
For sequential polylogarithmic factorization, e has to be upperbounded by O((logN)^l).

507. (THEORY) Tournament Graph Election, Coloring, Intrinsic Merit, Partitions and Bell Number - 8 February 2018
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tournament Graph of n vertices has n(n-1)/2 edges (complete). Each vertex of the tournament graph is uniquely colored by total of n colors.
Each edge (v1,v2) is the contest between vertices v1 and v2. Each edge of the tournament graph is progressively colored by the color of winning vertex of the edge endpoints. Thus at the end of the tournament, n(n-1)/2 edges are partitioned into n monochromatic sets of edges. Number of all possible partitions of a set is the Bell number. Vertex corresponding to Color of the biggest part in this edge set partition is the final winner. Any partition which has unequal parts has biggest part. Thus number of partitions of edges having atleast one biggest part = BellNumber - 1 because there is exactly one partition of n(n-1)/2 edges into n sets of equal size (n-1)/2. Tournament Graph Election is an alternative social choice function and does not involve Majority voting. Win in contest between two vertices of an edge can be defined as the vertex having greater Intrinsic Merit (In social networks this is the standard Intrinsic Fitness of a vertex). This formalizes the intrinsic merit usecases mentioned in NeuronRain Documentation and FAQ in http://neuronrain-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ . One additional usecase where majority voting falters and Intrinsic Merit is a necessity is the indispensability of experimental evidences in exact sciences. For example, in archaeology/history/mythology, "an artefact existed few millenia ago" is quite presumptive hypothesis which cannot be proved by mere majority voting in contemporary era. In tournaments involving knock-out(s), each elimination removes (n-1) edges and n/2 rounds decides winner. Each edge (v1,v2) of the tournament graph could alternatively be considered as a boolean majority function for choosing between v1 and v2 binary encoded by 0 and 1 and there are n(n-1)/2 boolean majority gates in a tournament roundrobin.

509. (FEATURE-DONE) Scheduler Analytics - Socket Streaming Server - Decorator pattern implementation - 9 February 2018
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. New Socket Streaming Server for Scheduler Analytics has been implemented in python-src/software_analytics/SchedulerAnalytics_WebServer.py
2. This invokes get_stream_data() function in python-src/software_analytics/DeepLearning_SchedulerAnalytics.py
3. get_stream_data() function is decorated by a Decorator class implemented in a new file python-src/webserver_rest_ui/NeuronRain_Generic_WebServer.py
4. SocketWebServerDecorator implemented in python-src/webserver_rest_ui/NeuronRain_Generic_WebServer.py is generic and overrides
 __init__() and __call__() functions. __call__() invokes the decoratee function get_stream_data() specific to Scheduler Analytics.
5. SocketWebServerDecorator can decorate any other streaming datasource, not just scheduler analytics - decoratee function has to be implemented
 accordingly.
6. Logs for Socket Streaming Server have been committed to python-src/software_analytics/testlogs/SchedulerAnalytics_WebServer.log.9February2018 and example Socket Streaming Client HyperLogLogCounter logs are at python-src/testlogs/Streaming_HyperLogLogCounter.log.9February2018
7. Global configs for socket streaming server host and port (64001) have been set in a new config file python-src/software_analytics/SchedulerAnalytics_Config.py
8. Known issue: There seems to be a random iterator disconnect because of psutil process_iter() process statistics streaming delay

510. (FEATURE-DONE) Scheduler Analytics Socket Streaming Decorator - Psutil iterator frequent disconnects resolution - 11 February 2018
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. SocketWebServerDecorator frequently and periodically throws "NoneType object not callable" exception.
2. This exception happens after every 215 or 217 processes (not sure what this magic number is)
3. Because of this try/except error handling has been added throughout decorator code
4. Socket listen queue size has been increased to 100
5. datasourcefunc() is re-called once an exception is thrown in a loop - a palliative cure
6. After this 215 barrier is breached. Logs for 558 processes streamed by Socket Server Decorator and received by Streaming Abstract
Generator client have been committed to python-src/software_analytics/testlogs/SchedulerAnalytics_WebServer.log.11February2018 and

511. (FEATURE-DONE) Approximate 3SAT Solver Randomized Rounding Update - NumPy random choice() replacing permutation() - 27 February 2018
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. CNFSATSolver.py - function creating random 3SAT instances has been updated to invoke NumPy random choice() instead of
permutation() without replacement - equivalent to nP3 per clause for n variables.
2. Logs for 16 variables - 16 clauses and 18 variables - 18 clauses have been committed to testlogs/CNFSATSolver.16variables16clauses.log2.27February2018
and testlogs/CNFSATSolver.18variables18clauses.log.27February2018
3. Numpy random choice() is based on Uniform distribution.
4. It is remarkable to note that observed probability average and Random Matrix probability 1/sqrt(m*n)
 are strikingly equal - a confirmation of the least squares randomized rounding and relaxation SAT solver's accuracy
5. Logs for 16*16 and 18*18 have few hundreds and thousand plus random 3SAT instances which are solved 100%

512. (FEATURE-DONE) ConceptNet5 Update - REST endpoints changed - 27 February 2018
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. ConceptNet5 rest_client.py has been imported which already wraps REST methods and endpoints
2. REST endpoints for search,lookup and query have been updated for ConceptNet 5.5 which were 5.4 earlier

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
513. (FEATURE-DONE and THEORY) Approximate SAT Solver and ConceptNet REST client updates - 21 variables,21 clauses LSMR and Common Ancestor Distance in ConceptNet5 - 28 February 2018
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Least Square SAT solver has been updated to print more readable debug messages and highlight MAXSAT approximation ratio
 average for SATs solved thus far
2.Number of variables and clauses is set to 21,21 and MAXSAT ratio is 98% for 34 random 3SATs
3.Logs for 21,21 has been committed to testlogs/CNFSATSolver.21variables21clauses.log.28February2018 which shows the observed literal
probabilities and random matrix 1/sqrt(m*n) literal probability agreeing well.
4.This is because of uniform unbiased (mostly) choice() when number of clauses = number of variables causing 1/sqrt(m*n) = 1/n
5.For unequal clauses and variables numbers, an epsilon biased PRG implementation in linux kernel is necessary (random.c might have to be
 rewritten)
---------------------
6.ConceptNet5 client has been updated to include a related() function wrapper which invokes /related REST endpoint for finding similar concepts.
7.ConceptNet5 finds related concepts by word embeddings implementation of word2vec which maps each word to a vector and similar words/concepts
are clustered together in this vector space. More precisely, word distances are represented as a word-word 2 dimensional matrix/graph
and sum of path edge weights between word pair is the distance.
8.For finding distance between two concepts a common ancestor algorithm has been implemented in new conceptnet_distance() function which recursively invokes related() to deep learn concepts and grows paths between the two concept endpoints. This recursion stops when paths grown from both ends meet i.e when there is a common ancestor (inspired by Savitch and USTCONN in logspace theorems).
9.Common ancestors are printed in end and distance between the concepts is also printed
10.Some example conceptnet_distance() invocations have been captured in ConceptNet/testlogs/ConceptNet5Client.log.28February2018

ConceptNet5 /related REST endpoint retrieves concepts similar to a concept and ranks them by word2vec word embedding similarity score. Recursiv
e Lambda Function Growth algorithm mentioned previously, grows lambda functions for random walks in a text definition graph created by Recursiv
e Gloss Overlap and word-word similarity/relevance is formalized by Neural Tensor Network. ConceptNet /related word2vec word embedding word-word similarity scores are perfect fit for Neuron Tensor Network entity relation potentials. Per random walk lambda function composition tree composes the neuron tensor potentials of all relations in the random walk. Composition trees are ranked by these composed potentials and Lambda composition tree of maximum potential best approximates the meaning of the Natural Language Text. This implies ConceptNet itself is one huge Graph Tensor Neuron Network Monolith. 

Rationale for creating random walks in text definition graph is: Process of Human Text Comprehension is simulated by connecting concepts in text in various possible random walks of finite lengths, creating a tree of their meaning as lambda function composition and choosing the most rewarding random walk ranked by composed potentials. Most rewarding random walk must contain the word vertices of high core numbers (or centralities/classes of the text) because most number of paths in the graph go through these hub vertices (Section 5.16 in https://tac.nist.gov/publications/2010/participant.papers/CMI_IIT.proceedings.pdf proves this notion for Recursive Gloss Overlap graph in terms of WordNet relations). Cycles in the definition graph have also been experimentally found to approximate the text well. Random walks/Cycles in the definition graph have close resemblance to Word-Chain Theory in Psycholinguistics which postulates Brain stores the information as chain of words. Word-Chain Theory was dismissed by the Deep Structure theory of Chomsky. Lambda Function Composition of Random Walks/Cycles combines Word-Chain and Deep Tree Structure into one - converts list of words into a meaning tree.

	- Statistical models are incomprehensible; they provide no insight.
	- Statistical models may provide an accurate simulation of some phenomena, but the simulation is done completely the wrong way; people don't decide what the third word of a sentence should be by consulting a probability table keyed on the previous two words, rather they map from an internal semantic form to a syntactic tree-structure, which is then linearized into words. This is done without any probability or statistics.
	- Statistical models have been proven incapable of learning language; therefore language must be innate, so why are these statistical modelers wasting their time on the wrong enterprise?

Recursive Lambda Function Growth implementation has been updated to print per random walk lambda function

Logs for this have been committed to testlogs/RecursiveLambdaFunctionnGrowth.log.GraphTensorNeuronNetwork.3March2018.

which is an evidence to the fact intrinsic merit peaks for random walks through high core numbered hub word vertices. Another aspect of ConceptNet's relevance to Graph Tensor Neuron Network is the strong resemblance of word2vec word embeddings to Connectomes in Computational Neuroscience (mentioned in references). Connectomes are the wiring diagrams for neurons in brain. Word2Vec clusters similar words of a text in vector space forming a clique. These word cluster cliques are wired together into a text graph. Thus Graph representation of Text and Neuron Cliques and Connectome Information Propagation Among Cliques of Neurons have uncanny similarities.

A graph is an ɛ-expander, if every—not too small and not too large—vertex-set S of the graph has at least ɛ∣S∣ outgoing edges (see [25] for the exact definition).  Random walks on good expander graphs converge very fast to the limit distribution: this means that good expander graphs, in a certain sense, are “intrinsically better” connected than bad expanders. It is known that large eigengap of the walk transition matrix of the graph implies good expansion property [25].  We have found that women’s connectomes have significantly larger eigengap, and, consequently, they are better expander graphs than the connectomes of men. For example, in the 83-node resolution, in the left hemisphere and in the unweighted graph, the average female connectome’s eigengap is 0.306 while in the case of men it is 0.272, with p = 0.00458..." - High expansion implies least energy by [Barabasi-Bianconi] Bose-Einstein condensation and vertices are able to attract high number of links.

Least Squares LSMR SAT solver implementation has been updated to print LSMR internal calculations. Maximum iterations, conlim, atol, btol parameters have been set to least values for reducing latency. But this reduces MAXSAT accuracy to ~94% which is still above 88% (7/8 approximation). SciPy Sparse dsolve.spsolve() was tried for solving least squares by csc_matrix and there were nan errors.Finally, LSMR looks to be the best of the lot. Logs for few random 3SATs of (21 clauses, 21 variables) have been committed to testlogs/CNFSATSolver.21variables21clauses.log.4March2018. Observed average probability of choosing a literal again agrees quite well to 1/sqrt(m*n) Random Matrix theoretical probability as gleaned from logs.

    -----------------------------------  =  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         Hardness of voter function                  				delta

which is based on the sudivided BP* error scenarios matrix mentioned earlier and described again below:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        x                               |    f(x) = f(x/e)      |       f(x) != f(x/e) Noise    |

This matrix picturises the various false positives and false negative errors possible in majority voting. Language L denotes voting pattern for candidate 0 to win (and its complement is voting pattern for candidate 1). Correlation x/e is the flip in voting pattern. Previous matrix divides BP* errors into 2 dimensions based on 1) whether the voting pattern is valid 2) Noise sensitivity/stability . For example a voting pattern x for candidate 0's win is correlated/flipped to x/e so that candidate 1 wins and input to Majority function f(), but yet majority function treats them with equal outcome - in matrix this error scenario is: x in L, x/e not in L and f(x)=f(x/e). Other scenarios follow this convention. Based on this error matrix, Hardness amplification ratio derived previously can be rewritten as:

 Hardness of Maj+voter composition       [sum(column2 entries)] + [sum(column3 entries)] - [sum(all no error entries)]
 -----------------------------------  =  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Hardness of voter function                  				delta

But Stability(f(x)) = Pr(f(x)=f(x/e)) - Pr(f(x) != f(x/e)) from definition of Noise stability => Pr(f(x)=f(y)) = (1+Stability)/2.
Sum(column2 entries) = Pr(f(x)=f(y)) = (1+Stability)/2.
Sum(column3 entries) = NoiseSensitivity
=> Hardness of Maj+Voter composition = (1+Stability)/2 + NoiseSensitivity - [sum(all no error entries)]
For majority function, Stability = (2/pi)*delta + O((delta)^1.5) and NoiseSensitivity = O(1/sqrt(n*delta))
=> Hardness of Maj+Voter composition = 1 + (2/pi)*delta + O((delta)^1.5) + O(1/sqrt(n*delta)) - [sum(all no error entries)]
For large n, previous hardness tends to 1 + (2/pi)*delta + O((delta)^1.5) - [sum(all no error entries)]

From definition of BP*, Probability of No error entries >= 2/3 => Sum(all no error entries) >= 2/3
=> Hardness of Maj+Voter composition <= [pi + 2*delta + k*pi*(delta)^1.5]/2*pi - 2/3
=> Hardness Amplification for Majority+Voter Composition <= [3*pi + 6*delta + 6k*pi*(delta)^1.5 - 2] /[6*pi*delta]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=> Hardness Amplification for Majority+Voter Composition <= 1/delta*(1/2-1/3*pi) + 1/pi + 6k*pi*(delta)^0.5
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
which is huge amplification for small hardness of voter boolean functions.
=> weak voters are hardened by majority
=> Computing majority by a circuit is increasingly hard as voters become weak (intuitively obvious because if voter circuits err, majority circuit errs, an indirect proof of Margulis-Russo Threshold and Condorcet Jury Theorem).

Sensitivity Conjecture polynomially relates sensitivity and block sensitivity of boolean functions as: s(f) <= bs(f) <= poly(s(f)). So far only Noise Sensitivity has been applied as sensitivity measure throughout for quantifying BP* error in Majority voting because it is a probability measure. But Sensitivity and Block Sensitivity are maximum number of bits and disjoint blocks of bits sensitive to output. Noise sensitivity probability can be written as:
				for_all_length_e(Number of correlations x/e for which [f(x) != f(x/e)])
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	for_all_length_e(Number of correlations x/e for which [f(x) == f(x/e)] + Number of correlations x/e for which [f(x) != f(x/e)])

Sensitivity and Block Sensitivity are maximum values of e(which can be number of bits or number of blocks) in summations of numerator and denominator. Block Sensitivity in Majority+Voter composition implies voter boolean functions are interdependent (correlated majority) and swayed by peer opinions en masse (Herding). Hardness of voter boolean function and majority are indirectly related to sensitivity and block sensitivity through summations in Noise Sensitivity probability.

NOTE: Here hardness of voter boolean function is approximately assumed to equal NoiseSensitivity of Voter Boolean Function and delta=epsilon. To be precise, delta = epsilon +/- error by BP* versus NoiseSensitivity/Stability Scenarios Matrix conventions. This +/- term is ignored. Accounting for this +/- error:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=> Hardness Amplification for Majority+Voter Composition <= 1/(delta + or - error)*(1/2-1/3*pi) + 1/pi + 6k*pi*(delta + or - error)^0.5

518. (THEORY and FEATURE-DONE) Hardness of Majority Voting, SAT Solver Update - Compressed Sensing and Moore-Penrose Pseudoinverse 
- Conflicts - 6 March 2018 - related to 517
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Approximate CNF SAT Solver has been updated to invoke Moore-Penrose Pseudoinverse function to compute approximate inverse of random 3SAT matrix and is multiplied as A^-1*b to find assignments x. Compressed Sensing implementation already uses pseudoinverse to decompress image from sketch which is similar to this SAT solver. Performance is almost similar to LSMR and MAXSAT approximation ratio hovers around 97-98% for 306 random 3SAT instances of 21 variables and 21 clauses. Randomized rounding threshold has been increased to 0.5 from 0.1 (a literal is set to 0 if it is < 0.5 and to 1 if >= 0.5). Observed per literal probabilities are equal to random matrix expected probability 1/sqrt(m*n). This reduces SAT solving to Compressed Sensing. There are some conflicts between the findings of SAT Solver and Hardness of Majority:
	(#) Hardness of Majority+Voter Boolean Function Composition in both directions - bottom-up Voter-Majority and top-down MajorityInverse-VoterInverse have been described earlier (bottom-up hardness has been derived) and top-down inversion is considerably harder (#P-complete counting problem) and a likely choice for an one-way function and strong pseudorandom generator implying P != NP (or does it imply something more than P != NP because top-down inversion is in #P?).In oracle notation, top-down inversion is #P^#P assuming VoterInverse() assignments are #P oracles to MajorityInverse() #P problem. Toda's theorem implies PH is in P^#P. If P^#P is in #P^#P, then top-down inversion is harder than PH and hardness of top-down inversion implies more than just P != NP.
	(#) SAT Solver random matrix analysis per-literal probability agrees with observed findings so far in small number of variables and clauses and MAXSAT approximation ratio for (21,21) and less number of variables-clauses combinations is almost 97% in most of the Solver executions - SAT solver solves the equal number of clause-variable instances exceeding 7/8-approximation similar to Karloff-Zwick semidefinite programming randomized algorithm but in deterministic polynomial time. Solving unequal clause-variables requires choice in a non-uniform distribution. Solving large number of variables-clauses in the order of millions might further confirm this trend but is cpu-intensive. So it still remains open if this more than 7/8-approximation implies P=NP. It is unusual that a simple rounding of real solutions to 0 or 1 from linear system of (boolean) equations, is able to solve most number of clauses per random SAT which is more obvious compared to other Randomized Rounding/Relaxation techniques like Semi-definite programming.
	(#) If Hardness of Majority implies something stronger than P != NP e.g an one-way function or PRG in #P^#P then there is no conflict from SAT Solver >7/8-approximation in deterministic Polynomial time and P=NP.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SAT Solver has been updated to use pinv2() pseudoinverse function which has been documented to be faster. After removing some code causing
redundant bottleneck, 1000 variables-1000 clauses random SATs have been solved by pinv2() and matrix multiplication to find real assignments which have been rounded. This means solving a million entry matrix (1000*1000). MAXSAT approximation ratio is 97%-98% again. Probability per literal average observed coincides with theoretical value of 1/sqrt(m*n). It has to be noted that Random matrix expectation for solving SAT translated to linear system of equations is an average case solution and is not worst case. This >7/8 approximation could imply AverageP=AverageNP or PromiseP=PromiseNP (for equal number of variables-clauses) if not P=NP. This is the likely reason for observed per literal probability being 97% asymptotically less than theoretical per literal probability 100%.

520. (THEORY and FEATURE-DONE) SAT Solver Update - 2500 clauses and 2500 variables - LSMR,LSQR and PseudoInverse Benchmarks - related to 518
- 9 March 2018
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. SAT Solver class has been changed to accept the algorithm as parameter which can be function names for LSMR,LSQR,PseudoInverse,SPSOLVE,
SOLVE etc.,
2. 2500 variables and 2500 clauses combination of SAT instances have been benchmarked by invoking LSMR, LSQR and PseudOInverse(pinv2) separately.
3. LSMR benchmark has 405 random 3SAT instances and is the fastest, LSQR and PseudoInverse(pinv2) benchmarks have only few random 3SAT instances.
4. LSQR and PseudoInverse(pinv2) are equally slower compared to LSMR by many orders of magnitude.
5. But approximation ratio for LSMR is 91-92% while LSQR and PseudoInverse trend at 96-97% though for small number of iterations. This probably
implies an accuracy versus speed tradeoff: LSMR is less accurate but fast while LSQR and PseudoInverse(pinv2) are more accurate but less fast.
6. Observed probability per literal for all three coincide with random matrix 1/sqrt(m*n) uniform distribution probability per literal
7. These numbers are only representative figures and number of iterations for LSQR and PseudoInverse(pinv2) are too meagre.
8. Logs have been committed to:

521. (THEORY and FEATURE-DONE) SAT Solver Update - Non-Uniform Choice - For both equal and unequal number of clauses and variables -
related to 520 - 11 March 2018
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SAT Solver has been updated to include a new Non-Uniform Choice function for creating random SAT instances by choosing a literal by
probability = 1/sqrt(m*n) which works for both equal and unequal number of clauses. This new function chooses non-uniformly. This function creates a submatrix of dimension (sqrt(m),sqrt(n)) chosen uniformly from larger matrix of (m clauses * n variables) by invoking choice() function to choose sqrt(m) rows from m rows and sqrt(n) columns from n columns. This uniformly chooses sqrt(m)*sqrt(n) entries from m*n entries of random matrix. This simulates the random matrix probability 1/sqrt(m*n) = sqrt(m*n)/m*n. From this submatrix 3 literals are chosen in succession to create a random 3SAT clause. Replace flag in choice() was set to False and True while creating random clause and there was not much difference and has been set to True.Logs for following 3 variables-clauses combinations have been committed to testlogs/ for ~100 random 3SAT instances each:
	1000 variables, 1000 clauses - CNFSATSolver.1000variables1000clauses.NonUniformChoice.log.11March2018
	1100 variables, 1200 clauses - CNFSATSolver.1100variables1200clauses.NonUniformChoice.log.11March2018
	1200 variables, 1100 clauses - CNFSATSolver.1200variables1100clauses.NonUniformChoice.log.11March2018
From logs it is evident non-uniform choice function defined as previously approximately simulates the bias and almost matches theoretical 1/sqrt(m*n) random matrix expected per literal probability. LSMR algorithm has been chosen and MAXSAT approximation ratio is 91-93% for 100 iterations for each of the 3 variable-clause combinations. For equal variable-clause combinations, non-uniform choice function is equivalent to choice() and expected and observed probabilities per literal agree fully. Previous benchmarks have been done to verify the random matrix theory for Satisfiability problem which is a probabilistic average case P?=NP problem mentioned in hardness amplification conflicts previously. There is also a special case conflict with PARITYSAT Hastad-Linial-Mansour-Nisan Theorem circuit size counterexample mentioned in 53.15. Also unequal variable-clause SATs can be simulated by equal variable-clause SATs by setting redundant variables to 0 in disjunction of the literals in clauses or redundant clauses in conjunction to 1. Thus non-uniform choice may not be necessary.

522. (THEORY and FEATURE-DONE) SAT Solver Update - Non-Uniform Choice - 3200 variables and 3100 clauses and Alpha=4.26 - related to 521 
- 12 March 2018
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SAT Solver has been updated for some aesthetics - literal selection in non-uniform choice has been parametrized: sequential or simultaneous
 based on how three random literals are chosen per random 3SAT clause - sequentially as 3*nP1 or simultaneously as nP3. But no difference was
observed between these two choices. Number of variables is set to 3200 and clauses to 3100. LSMR iteration has been increased to 5 and conlim
reduced to 10. For few random 3SATs, observed MAXSAT approximation ratio average stands at ~95%. This accuracy has been observed to increase proportional to number of LSMR iterations. Commercial SAT solvers solve million variable-clause combinations in few seconds but in exponential time. Two other logs have been committed which solve the notorious Alpha=4.26 Clause/Variable ratio, which is known to be hardest subset of SAT and
where a phase transition occurs from easy-to-hard. Number of unsatisfiable formulae increase for alpha > 4.26. MAXSAT approximation ratio observed for few random 3SAT instances is ~91% for number of variables 300 and 1000 and alpha=4.26. Observed per literal probability is skewed and substituting it in random matrix MAXSAT approximation ratio m^2*n^2*p^4 shows an anomaly. Another fact observed: per literal probability does not change at all for any number of iterations and stays put and because of this observed MAXSAT ratio converges within few iterations itself.

523. (THEORY and FEATURE-DONE) SAT Solver Update - Non-uniform Choice 2 - 5000 variables and Alpha=4.267 and some intuition - related to 522 
- 15 March 2018
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SAT Solver has been updated for a new nonuniform choice function nonuniform_choice2() which has following algorithm:
	- Each permutation nPn of length n is elongated to n*n*alpha length array by replicating a non-variable X of large index (n*n)
	- Literals are chosen from this new array as (n*n*alpha)P1 or (n*n*alpha)P3 in a while loop till a valid literal which is not equal to n*n is found 
	- This creates a probability of fraction n/(n*n*alpha)=1/(n*alpha) for per literal choice.
But this implementation was found to be no different from nonuniform_choice() which chooses a submatrix in per literal probability and therefore has been commented at present. MAXSAT approximation ratio observed was 88% for nonuniform_choice2() versus 90% for nonuniform_choice(). 5000 variables and Alpha=4.267 have been solved for few iterations and MAXSAT approximation ration is 90-91%. In all the benchmarks done so far, it has been observed that equal variables-clause combinations almost always converge to ~95% MAXSAT approximation ratio and  Alpha=4.267 almost always converge to ~90-91%. Though these numbers are not conclusive and comprehensive, previous emerging pattern is too striking. 

Here the intuition on how LSMR/LSQR works has to be mooted - Each binary assignment string can be thought of as a step function plotted as binary value versus variables. For example, assignment 001101 is plotted as:
			----  -
			|  | |
		      ---  ---
where troughs represent 0s and peaks 1s. LSMR/LSQR finds a set of real valued points on a sinusoidal polynomial which approximates this step function by minimizing sum of distances/errors between troughs-peaks of polynomial and those of step function. By rounding the peaks and troughs of this LSMR polynomial to 1s and 0s thus converts the sinusoid to a step function. Minimizing the sum of squares distance error implies, this polynomial is almost unique(though there can be multiple satisfying assignments) and is able to extract atleast one satisfying assignment.

Probability of an LSMR/LSQR real-to-binary round off assignment failing to satisfy a random 3SAT:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For each binary variable xi, LSMR/LSQR creates a real value which is rounded off as:
	xi   -    0  if  xi < 0.5
	xi   -    1  if  xi > 0.5
This round off can fail if:
	xi   -    1  if  xi < 0.5
	xi   -    0  if  xi > 0.5

Lovasz Local Lemma Analyses described earlier further explain the clause-variable dependency graph(Factor graph) scenarios but only lowerbound the MAXSAT approximation ratio for various values of dependency. But Random Matrix Least Squares Error Partial Derivative Analysis forbids values of assignments which cause such large deviations of real solutions from 0s and 1s to maximum possible extent,by providing a mechanism on how to choose a literal - 1/sqrt(m*n) probability - reverse-engineered a posteriori probability. In other words, real solutions are almost in proximity to 0 or 1 - sinusoid approximates step-function near-perfectly. Any other probability distribution of per literal choice is theoretically inferior.

related to 523 - 16 March 2018
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SAT Solver has been updated to accept commandline parameters of number of variables and Alpha (Clause/Variable ratio) as:
		$python CNFSATSolver.py <number_of_variables> <alpha>
Some debug prints have been changed. Following sets of SATs were solved and variation of MAXSAT approximation ratio versus Alpha has been
captured as graph (for nonuniform_choice()):
-----------------------------------------------------------
Number of Variables - 600 (after atleast 15 random 3SAT iterations)

Logs for an iteration of 5000 variables and Alpha=4.267 has been committed to python-src/testlogs/CNFSATSolver.5000variablesAlpha4.267.log.16March2017 which also has MAXSAT approximation ratio of 90-91%. Gradual nosedive of MAXSAT approximation ratio as Alpha increases is notable and it stabilizes to 90-91% after Alpha >= 4 for both 300 and 600 variables implying phase transition.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SAT Solver has been updated for a new nonuniform_choice3() function based on an Epsilon Bias Test Snippet EpsilonBiasNonUniformChoice.py which has been added to repository. This is similar to nonuniform_choice2() but Probabilities of nonuniformly chosen literals are computed separately and updated within the while loops also. Algorithm is similar to nonuniform_choice2() which elongates a permutation by replicating a skew variable. Average probabilities of all variables other than skew variable almost match the random matrix 1/sqrt(m*n) probability. Logs which print these probabilities for 1000 variables and Alpha=1/Alpha=4.267 have been committed to testlogs/CNFSATSolver.1000variablesAlpha1.log.16March2018 and testlogs/CNFSATSolver.1000variablesAlpha4.267.log.16March2018.

525. (FEATURE-DONE) SAT Solver Update - nonuniform_choice3() updated for constant multiple in expansion of the variables array
- 19 March 2018 - related to 524
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. CNFSATSolver.py nonuniform_choice3() has been changed to expand the variables array by following relation:
        n + x = n*sqrt(alpha)
        x = n*(sqrt(alpha)-1)
        => array of n variables is expanded to array of size n*(sqrt(alpha)-damp) for alpha = number_of_clauses/number_of_variables
2. damp variable has been hardcoded to 2 than 1 which approximates theoretical 1/sqrt(m*n) probability well because of round-off.
3. This expansion creates an approximate nonuniform probability 1/n*sqrt(alpha) per literal excluding replicated skew variable which is
filtered in the while loops
4. Example SAT Solver logs for 1000 variables and Alpha=4.267 has been committed to python-src/testlogs/CNFSATSolver.1000variablesAlpha4.267.log.19March2018
5. MAXSAT Approximation ratio again is 90-91% for 20+ random 3SATs and nonuniform per literal probability almost matches 1/sqrt(m*n)
(till penultimate decimal)

526. (THEORY) Counterexample in Majority Voting, Timeline Evolution of Belief Propagation, Intrinsic Merit - related to 507 - 20 March 2018
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Previous sections described a counterexample in Majority Voting for a question:
	"Did an artefact exist millenia ago?"
There are two possible answers: Yes and No which depend on intrinsically determining truth of answer to this question. Both possible answers are belief propagated as trees which evolve over time following a gossip protocol. Root of either of the trees propagates its belief to its children and so on recursively for all other internal nodes. Each edge in either of the trees has a belief potential for "Yes" and "No". Parent node propagates its belief to the children proportional to this potential. If potential is below a threshold, belief propagation stops and trees are pruned.  Thus there are two trees which correspond to two sets of people who believe "Yes" and "No" by potentials percolated from Roots. Only the root node has most authentic direct intrinsic evidence to either Yes or No truth value to the question. Question is: How can intrinsic absolute truth of answer be determined? Does size of the trees imply truth i.e Can Majority Voting determine intrinsic truth value at the root? This problem becomes all the more non-trivial when a chronologically ancient portion of tree (e.g Root is extinct) is not available and only nodes closer to leaves remain. Value of belief potential is a function of intrinsic truth viewed by the roots of either tree.

1. Ray Shooting Queries based on Hardy-Ramanujan Theorem for Normal Order of number of factors of an integer has been implemented as a
new function.
2. Each approximate factor is queried by a ray from origin of slope tan(m*pi/(2*k*loglogN)) intersecting hyperbolic arc bow and approximate factors are:
                sqrt(N/[tan(m*pi/(2*k*loglogN))])-1 for m=1,2,3,...,kloglogN
3. Two integers have been factorized using local tile search and comparison between approximate factors and actual factors have been logged in:

4. Approximate Ray Shooting could be useful for integers having large value of factor multiplicity BigOmega (sum of prime factor powers)
5. Constant k has been hardcoded presently and has to be heuristically found.
6. Approximate Factors are helpful for sieving huge integers and binary search can be localized based on these approximate factors as beacons.It is not necessary to search the entire pixelated hyperbolic arc.

529. (THEORY) Consensus, Pareto Optimality, Intrinsic-Perceived Value/Merit Equilibrium, Fair Division, Nultiple Agent Resource Allocation(MARA),MAXSAT ranking of texts - related to 432,440,513,526 and all Intrinsic Fitness/Merit sections - 26 March 2018,27 March 2018
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Intrinsic Fitness/Merit and Perceived Merit Equilibrium has been described earlier as an approximate consensus measure for agreeing on value or
merit of an entity. Consensus problem for absolute intrinsic merit arises in the following context of Fair Division where set of resources have
to be allocated amongst multiple agents fairly (also known as MARA-Multi Agent Resource Allocation). Fairness in allocation is usually expressed by Pareto Optimality which is defined as:
For a utility function u:(Good,Agent)->Happiness, set of agents (x1,x2,x3,...,xn) and goods/services/resources (r1,r2,r3,...,rm) allocated by u  with a Happiness Vector V=(a1,a2,a3,...,an) , there is no other alternative allocation Happiness Vector V'=(a1',a2',a3',...,an') for which u(ai') >= u(ai) for all i=1,2,3,...,n and there exists an agent i such that u(ai') > u(ai).
Most obvious application of Pareto Optimality is Pricing or Determining Value of Goods. Allocation is Envy-Free if no agent feels its own resource allocation as inferior to others. Equating Intrinsic Value and Intrinsic Merit reduces the Multi Agent Resource Allocation or Fair Division problem to Fair Judgement of Intrinsic Merit. Preferences or Desires of an agent are specified by Logic clauses - Ceteris Paribus - all others being equal agent prefers (P1 /\ !P2) to (!P1 /\ P2). Translating the Intrinsic Value MARA problems to Intrinsic Merit MARA problem is non-trivial. For example, if the agents are web URLs and merit has to be fairly apportioned to the Web URLs (Ranking), to ensure no URL feels envious requires defining per URL preferences. This is precisely where MAXSAT representation of per text/URL preferences finds its utility - number of clauses satisfied per text/URL determines its merit i.e text/URL prefers some clauses over others or it has certain special qualities not in others. Pareto Optimality is NP-Complete by reduction from Set Packing problem(Problem of finding disjoint subsets from a collection of subsets).

Traditional Ranking methodology followed is to compute ranking scores per website URL independent of other URLs i.e envy is not accounted for which vitiates fairness. By MARA based ranking, Ranking Fairness is strengthened and Total Cumulative Intrinsic Merit = 1.0, is viewed as Pie/Cake cutting problem and websites are allocated pareto-optimal fractional merit by an envy-free protocol. Thus Sum(rank(url))=1.

An example envy-free cake cutting algorithm is a hash function which distributes the values nearly equally onto the per-key buckets of the hash table - all buckets have equal number of values or resources are equidistributed. Varying the hash functions changes the per-key bucket number of values. Each key is an agent requiring certain number of values in its bucket and Choosing a hash function which satisfies this constraint is a MARA protocol.

There exists a bijection between a discrete probability distribution and per-bucket sizes of hashtables (or) parts in a set partition. If each discrete random variable xi has probability p(xi), sum(p(xi)) = 1. Similarly, if each bucket xi of a hash table (part in a set partition/exact cover) has size b(xi), sum(b(xi)) = N (total number of values). Choosing an apt probability distribution does fair allocation e.g If fair allocation constraint is a gaussian, mapping discrete points in normal probability distribution (p(xi)) to size of hash table buckets fairly allocates. Expressing the fair allocation constraints as 3SAT and solving it by Random Matrix LSMR/LSQR Approximate SAT Solver yields real solutions to the constraint variables if rounding is overlooked. As described earlier, this random matrix SAT solver approximates the assignment step function by a polynomial traversing these real assignment points. Riemann Sum Discrete Integral of points on this polynomial should be theoretically equal or close to parity of the binary assignment extracted by LSMR/LSQR.

Essence:
--------
Meaning of a text is approximated as:
        - Create a Definition Graph Representation of Text from some Ontology
        - Do random walks/Hamiltonian on the graph to simulate the human text comprehension
        - Get classes of the text from Recursive Gloss Overlap Unsupervised Classifier
        - Compute Lambda Composition Trees for all random walks in definition graph
        - These random walk lambda composition trees are approximations of all possible meanings of the text
        - Compute Graph Tensor Neuron Network Intrinsic Merit for all random walk lambda composition trees
        - Lambda Composition Tree of Maximum Graph Tensor Neuron Network Intrinsic Merit is the most likely approximate meaning of the text
        - This is obvious because this maximum merit tree has Neuron Tensor Network Relations of maximum similarity/truth value and
these similarities are composed and belief propagated

Exact Cover, Matiyasevich-Robinson-Davis-Putnam Theorem  - related to 461,462,490 - 19 April 2018
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As mentioned in previous sections, complement functions are subsets of set of Diophantine Equations defining
each diophantine set in an exact cover - this generalizes definition of complement functions to exact cover of size greater than 2. Exact Cover is a special scenario of Bin Packing/Space Filling/Tiling plane (e.g Pentominoes tiling of a Chess board, N-Queens Problem etc.,). Complement Diophantine Equations for sets in an exact cover uniquely determine each element in tiling and thus create a bijective map between Diophantines and Tiles(i.e sets in exact cover).

----------
533.1 Pentominoes Tiling Exact Cover for Chess board - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_cover - Each pentomino tile can be defined by a Diophantine Equation because Exact Cover is NP-complete recursive set, from MRDP theorem. These diophantine equations for tiles are complement functions of the exact cover.

20 April 2018
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Complement Function Implementation has been updated to invoke sympy Pell Equation solver for some N and D
in x^2 - D*y^2 = N
2. Factorization reduces to integer solutions of Pell Equation but the converse is harder - factors must be known
a priori as pq = N from some factoring algorithm. Then following equations can be solved:
        x + sqrt(D)*y = p
        x - sqrt(D)*y = q
for x and y.

535. (THEORY and FEATURE-DONE) Complement Diophantine and Factorization - Pell Equation Solver Update 2 -
20 April 2018
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Complement Function Implementation has been updated to invoke sympy Pell Equation solver for some N and D
in x^2 - D*y^2 = N for D=1
2. Following are the factors p,q of N:
  x + y = p
  x - y = q
for Pell equation solutions x and y. This is exponential in number of bits of N and equivalent to most
Number Field Sieve algorithms for Factorization in vogue. Computational Geometric Factorization in NC
implies x and y can be found in parallel polynomial time (which is quite surprising given the antiquity and
notorious difficulty of this ~1500 year old problem).
3. Pell's Equation for Factoring and Prime polynomials (e.g Matiyasevich, Jones-Sato-Wada-Wiens) are thus
complement diophantines representing the exact cover {Primes,Composites} of the Set of Natural Numbers

536. (THEORY) Complement Functions, Complement Graphs, Ramsey coloring, Intrinsic Merit of Text-Graph - 
related to 2,338 - 21 April 2018, 25 April 2018
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Relations between the concept of complement functions and complement graphs have been described earlier in the
context of Perfect Graph Theorem. This notion of complement graphs has direct application in graph representation of texts (text-graph) and resulting Intrinsic Merit qualities of the text-graph. For example, complement graph dual of a text-graph has edges amongst word vertices absent in its primal. Also cliques in primal graph G become independent sets in complement dual graph G' and vice-versa. Complement graphs have spawned vast literature of theoretical results foremost being Perfect Graph Theorem. Recursive Gloss Overlap and Recursive Lambda Function Growth algorithms map text to Graph of word vertices and composition of Lambda Functions - a language between Context Free Grammar and Context Sensitive Grammar. Composition of lambda functions by random walks/cycles/girth in text graphs makes it a Church-Turing-equivalent model which is an overlap of two fields - Formal Languages Theory and Graph Theory. It is an open question as to what Complements of text-graph and their Chromatic number imply: Does a complement of text-graph negate the meaning of text? As opposed to Coloring a linear sentence by Part-of-speech tagging, what does coloring of text-graph imply? E.g The sentence "It rained heavily today" is colored by PoS tags as Pronoun-Verb-Adjective-Object which is a Ramsey coloring of text construed as a sequence of words. Alphabet coloring and arithmetic progressions of alphabet positions in text has been already described in 2.10,2.11 and 2.12. In text-graphs coloring is usually edge coloring and not vertex coloring where each edge color corresponds to a relation (Is-a, Has-a, Is-part-of etc.,) between word vertices. All theorems related to Edge Coloring therefore apply to text graphs. Thus Complement Functions/Complement Graphs are useful in deep structure analysis of text graphs. If the text-graph is complete, Ramsey Theorem for edge k-coloring applies (relations are colors), order emerges and there exists a c-homogeneous subgraph edge-colored by same relation c.

There is a known theorem which states that if a graph G is disconnected its complement G's is connected and vice-versa. This can be proved by elementary arguments. If x-y is not an edge in G, x-y have an edge in G'. If x-y is an edge in G, x and y are in same component in G. If z is a vertex in some other disconnected component of G, then there are no x-z and y-z vertices in G but they exist in G' and there is x-z-y path in G' and G' is connected. In the context of WordNet relations, variant of this theorem has been proved as condition for meaningfulness and Intrinsic Merit in Section 5.16 of https://tac.nist.gov/publications/2010/participant.papers/CMI_IIT.proceedings.pdf . This qualitatively answers the previous question on meaningfulness of text-graph complement. If text-graph G is disconnected (i.e less meaningful) its complement G' is connected (i.e more meaningful). Here two meanings of primal and its complement text graph need not negate each other. Meaning of complement could be totally different from primal and may be in some other class.

WordNet Synsets for words have noun,verb etc., suffixes (.n,.v,...) which is tantamount to vertex coloring of the text-graph as nouns,verbs,adjectives etc.,. Set of vertices of same color class constitute independent sets or partition the word vertices into monochromatic independent sets. Perfect Graph Theorem applies if text-graph G and its complement G' are perfect (i.e if every induced subgraph of G or G' has its Chromatic Number equal to Maximal Clique Number).

538. (THEORY) Shell Turing Machines, Word2Vec and Intrinsic Merit - 24 April 2018, 25 April 2018 - related to 42
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shell Turing Machines described earlier are experimental enhancements to Turing Machine definition which
introduces dimension as a parameter in addition to tapes, alphabets, head etc., Adding dimension to Turing
Machines has immense applications and simulates lot of real world computations which span across multiple
dimensions. For example a Turing Machine defined in dimension d+1 has more computational power than a machine
defined in dimension d i.e L(T(d)) is in L(T(d+1)). This is a dimensional hierarchy as opposed to Time and Space
hierarchies of Turing Machines. This has striking applications in graph representation of texts. Each word
vertex in a definition graph G1 can be represented as a vector in a space of dimension d. Word2Vec embeddings
(e.g ConceptNet) already implement this by mapping each word to a vector in space of some dimension.
Then another definition graph G2 of words defined on a vector space of dimension d+1 can elicit more meaning
from text than G1. Recursive Lambda Composition Trees for G1 and G2 are two Turing-equivalent computation models
 approximating the meaning - G2 approximates better than G1. Essentially a Turing Machine/Lambda Function is 
extracted from natural language text by growing Lambda Function by recursive composition. In other words intrinsic merit computed for G2 is more accurate than G1 for same text. Present algorithms for Recursive Gloss Overlap and Recursive Lambda Function Growth do not affix dimension information for word vertices.

539. (THEORY) Recursive Lambda Function Growth for sentences - related to 385,412,530,536 - 26 April 2018
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recursive Lambda Function Growth algorithm described so far depends on a text graph and walks/cycles in the text
graph are deemed as sentences of word vertices connected by WordNet/ConceptNet/Ontology relations which are converted to lambda function composition tree. This section explains how to construct a lambda function composition from linear sentences with no text-graph representation.

Approximate algorithm to create a lambda composition tree from sentence:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
*) PoS/NER tag the sentence into Nouns,Verbs,Adjectives,Adverbs,Pronouns etc.,
*) Make all words tagged as verbs into lambda functions and noun/object for the verb as respective arguments
for the lambda function. This is a thumbrule because verbs in the sentences are the crux/actions on the nouns and objects.
*) Most natural languages are self-similar in the sense, the simple sentence template Noun-Pronoun-Adverb-Verb-Adjective-Object is recursively substituted to create large sentences. For example Object in Noun-Verb-Object template can itself be another template of the form Noun-Verb-Object.
*) Adjectives/Adverbs qualifying nouns/verbs/objects are created as wrapper lambda functions for nouns/verbs/objects.
*) This algorithm for extracting Lambda functions/Turing Machines from Natural Language Texts is the maximum theoretical limit attainable if Church-Turing Thesis is true. In other words, this algorithm creates Turing machines recognizing Recursively Enumerable sets.

Example sentence: "It rained heavily today"
The example sentence is PoS tagged as Pronoun-Verb-Adjective-Object. Verb "rained" is marked as lambda function (after normalizing to "rain" if preferred.). Adjective "heavily" qualifying Object "today" is the wrapper function "heavily(today)". "It" is a separate lambda function for pronoun. Verb function "rained" thus accepts "It" and "heavily(today)" as arguments creating the tree:
	rained(It, heavily(today))
This algorithm is independent of natural language of the text. Lacuna in this composition from flat sentence is the deep structure - connections/paths between words - is not exploited which is remedied by the random walks/cycle traversal in text-graph and maximum merit composition is chosen.

546. (THEORY) Depth-2 Recursive Majority Circuit and a Contradiction - related to 14,319,430 - 20 May 2018
- Updates to https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/IndepthAnalysisOfVariantOfMajorityVotingwithZFAOC_2014.pdf
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Depth-2 Recursive Majority Circuit consists of two levels of Majority circuits composed as:
	Maj(Maj1,Maj2,Maj3,...,Majn)
for majority functions Maj1,Maj2,...Majn for each constituencies c1,c2,c3,...,cn respectively.This kind of social
 choice function is followed by most real world democracies. For Multiway Contests binary indices 0,1 for candidates are replaced by large integers. Following is a schematic for hash table representation of depth-2 Majority voting function for 2 candidates:

	c1:	########################################
		@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

	c2:	####################
		@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

	c3:	################################
		@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
		...

for constituencies c1,c2,c3,... and for candidate0 and candidate1. Votes for Candidate0 are collated in bucket marked # and Votes for Candidate1 are collated in bucket marked @ per constituency by a theoretical electronic voting machine using Locality Sensitive Hashing. Winners are: 
	For c1, Candidate0 (#)
	For c2, Candidate1 (@)
	For c3, Candidate0 (#)
and in 2 of 3 constituencies, Candidate0 wins and therefore attains depth-2 majority. But if the constituency gerrymandering vanishes and votes in all constituencies for Candidate0 and Candidate1 are summed up, Candidate1 wins- Total @(s) outnumber Total #(s). Previous hash table representation of depth-2 Majority function can be translated to depth-2 Majority circuit composition Maj(Maj1,Maj2,...,Majn). In terms of Majority depth-2 composition circuit this can be written as:
	leaf: Sum(parity(c1,0),parity(c2,0),...) > Sum(parity(c1,1),parity(c2,1),...)
	depth-1: Sum(parity(c1,0),parity(c2,0),...) < Sum(parity(c1,1),parity(c2,1),...)
In other words, Total number of 0s > Total number of 1s at leaf of the Majority depth-2 circuit but Total number of 0s < Total number of 1s at depth 1 of the composition. Depth-2 majority is a direct consequence and application of Axiom of Choice in ZF Set Theory which states that there exists a choice function which chooses an element from each set in a set of sets possibly infinite.

550. (THEORY and FEATURE-DONE) Computational Geometric Factorization - Single Core - Hardy-Ramanujan Ray Shooting Queries - 23 May 2018
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Hard-Ramanujan Approximate Ray Shooting Queries function has been refactored to compute the angle and tangent
of the ray simply as functions of multiples of N/k*loglogN.
2. Precisely angle between the rays must be a function of spacing/gap between prime factors of N which is
at present assumed to be equal.
3. Cramer's bound for Spacing between primes is O(sqrt(p)*log(p)) assuming Riemann Hypothesis is true while
 the best known modern bound proved in 1995 and 2001 by [Baker-Harman-Pintz] is p^(0.525) which is unconditional.
4. Prime number theorem implies prime counting function ~ N/logN. Probability that a prime below N is a prime factor of N is roughly: (loglogN*logN)/N - ratio of Hardy-Ramanujan estimate and Prime Counting Function.
5. Even with this equal spacing between prime factors, two experimental logs committed herewith show
previous approximate ray shooting is exact, passing through an exact factor found by tile binary search. Both logs have an exact match for one factor - approximate and exact ray shooting coincide.
6. By replacing equal spacing by a function of Cramer and Baker-Harman-Pintz Prime Gap estimate might accurately fine tune the location of a factor further.

551. (THEORY) Computational Geometric Factorization - Hardy-Ramanujan and Prime Number Theorems, Gap between
consecutive prime factors of an integer, Ray shooting queries based on these - 24 May 2018
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From [Baker-Harman-Pintz] estimate Gap between primes p(n) and p(n+1) is approximately (p(n))^0.525. Combining
Hardy-Ramanujan and Prime Number Theorem following estimate of number of primes between two prime factors of an
integer N can be found:

Approximate number of primes between 2 prime factors of N = (Number of primes less than N) / (Number of prime factors of N) ~ N/((logN)*(loglogN))

If pf(n) and pf(n+1) are two consecutive prime factors of N, then from Prime Number Theorem number of primes between pf(n) and pf(n+1) = (pf(n+1)/log(pf(n+1)) - pf(n)/log(pf(n))) which is equivalent to Hardy-Ramanujan and Prime Number Theorem estimate N/((logN)*(loglogN))

=> pf(n+1)/log(pf(n+1)) - pf(n)/log(pf(n)) = N/((logN)*(loglogN))
=> pf(n+1)/log(pf(n+1)) = pf(n)/log(pf(n)) + N/((logN)*(loglogN))

Previous relation finds the next prime factor pf(n+1) in terms of pf(n) as a logarithmic ratio. Similar recurrence can be arrived at based on [Baker-Harman-Pintz] estimate too. If p1,p2,p3,...,pm are primes between pf(n) and pf(n+1):
	p1 = pf(n) + (pf(n))^0.525
	p2 = p1 + p1^0.525
	p3 = p2 + p2^0.525
	...
	pf(n+1) = pm + pm^0.525

Expanding this recurrence yields a continued nested exponentiation of 0.525 for pf(n+1) in terms of pf(n) which must be equal to Hardy-Ramanujan-Prime Number Theorem estimate N/((logN)*(loglogN)). This estimate for gap between two consecutive prime factors of an integer can be substituted for computing angles for prime factor points ray shooting queries in Computational Geometric Factorization in lieu of equal spacing.

----------
6.Analysis:
----------
These ray shooting queries are Monte Carlo algorithms with an error bounded by the spacing between two prime
factors. Ray shooting to find a prime factor by Hardy-Ramanujan succeeds with a probability loglogN/N which is
 loglogN/2^logN=loglogN/(2^(2^loglogN)) which is exponentially small. But real benefit of ray shooting queries is in the following factorization algorithm:
        - Sequentially ray shoot O(loglogN) queries in O(loglogN) time to create beacons
        - Distance between any two such beacon in the hyperbolic arc bow is O(N/loglogN)
        - This creates O(loglogN) hyperbolic pixelated segments of length O(N/loglogN)
        - Pixelation of O(N/loglogN) sized segment requires Parallel RAM sorting (e.g. Using Cole's Parallel Sort each pixelated segment of length O(N/loglogN) can be sorted in O(log(N/loglogN)) on PRAMs.)
        - Each pixelated segment can be binary searched in log(N/loglogN) time
        - Sequentially this requires O(loglogN)*O(log(N/loglogN)) time for all segments
        - Total factorization time = O(loglogN) + O(loglogN)*O(log(N/loglogN)) + O(loglogN)*O(log(N/loglogN)) < O(loglogN) * O(logN)
        - This PRAM algorithm does factorization in at most O(loglogN*logN) time compared to O((logN)^2) or O((logN)^3) PRAM time algorithms using segment trees and sorting described earlier.

555. (THEORY) Non-majority social choice, Majority social choice - Boolean Composition of Majority+SAT Versus SAT Oracles, Margulis-Russo Threshold , KRW Conjecture, Condorcet Jury Theorem and a conflict - 4 June 2018 - related to 129, 317, 355, 358, 400, 429 and all other Majority Voting related sections
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the theoretical drafts in this document, relativizing proofs involving oracle access to Voter SAT have been
neglected in favour of boolean function composition/communication complexity proofs based on composition of 
Majority and Voter SAT boolean functions. But a recent result has proved BQP^A is not contained in PH^A relative
to some oracle A. This has direct relation to Condorcet Jury Theorem circuit for Majority Voting having SAT oracle access. P(Good) binomial series (or Condorcet Jury Theorem) equates Non-majority and Majority social choice based on correctness of electorate group decision vis-a-vis individual decision correctness. This is tantamount to equating goodness of following two algorithms in different complexity classes:
	*) LHS: An algorithm having access to PRG making a random choice of a boolean function(voter) - could be in BPP/BQP/RP/BPNC/RNC
	*) RHS: An algorithm which does majority voting by composing Majority function and Individual voter SATs - could be in PH (DC-uniform) if the number of variables m, per Voter SAT are same for all and size of the electorate is n=2^m - exponential fanin - and depth restricted (unrestricted is in EXP).

Assuming both LHS and RHS have equal goodness (1-error) of 0.5 (by Margulis-Russo Threshold and Condorcet Jury Theorem), which happens when each individual votes with correctness p=0.5 (homogeneous voters), Oracle version of the previous equality is (for some oracle Voter SAT A which has goodness p=0.5):
	*) LHS: BPP^A / BQP^A / RNC^A / BPNC^A
	*) RHS: PH^A / EXP^A / Other larger classes

Caveat: This assumes equal error/goodness implies lowerbounds and there are complete problems for respective classes.

Since goodness/error is equal, if one side of the equality is a C-complete problem, the other side devours class C. E.g:
	*) if LHS is BQP^A-complete and RHS is PH^A, BQP^A is in PH^A - this is in direct conflict with 555.1 which separates BQP and PH relative to some oracle A.
	*) if RHS is PH^A-complete and LHS is BQP^A, PH^A is in BQP^A

Resolving this conflict requires:
	*) LHS and RHS have different Oracles (Pseudorandom Oracle A1 for LHS and SAT Oracle A2 for all voters in RHS) - but in real-world voting nothing prohibits all voters from making a random choice and thus there is always a possibility electorate votes at random (Therefore Both Oracles are Pseudorandom Generators and A1=A2. This is exactly Balls-and-Bins problem described in sections on theoretical EVMs based on LSH and separate chaining hashtables elsewhere in this draft).
	*) ruling out existence of BPQ^A-complete problems for Voter SAT oracle A separating PH and BPQ.
	*) assumption of equal goodnesses of LHS and RHS implying lowerbounds is wrong.
	*) Oracle A which separates (BQP^A is not in PH^A) has goodness > 0.5 or < 0.5 violating Margulis-Russo threshold.

But if LHS is Promise-BPP-Complete which are known to exist and RHS is PH^A, Promise-BPP is in PH^A.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized.py has been updated to include a new function
for ray shooting queries which implements recent breakthrough result in Prime Gap estimation - there are
infinitely many twin primes separated by gap < 70000000 - by [Yitang Zhang] which refines
[Goldston-Pintz-Yildirim] Sieve. This might have effect only for finding primes between prime factors of
large integers and summing up the gap for spacing between any two prime factors.
2.Constants k and l for multiplying estimation bounds have been changed slightly.
3.logs for this have been committed to testlogs/ for an 8-digit 26-bit integer.
4.None of the five ray shooting queries in the bouquet shoot exactly. But Hardy-Ramanujan is still the best and
Baker-Harman-Pintz estimate is also close enough to actual factors.
5.Ray Shooting's success rate depends on the number and multiplicity of the prime factors - Integers of large Big Omega and Small Omega would have lot of prime factors taking a point-blank hit. In other words large multiplicative partition (Factorisatio Numerorum) number of an integer is a pre-requisite for exact ray shooting. Finding the values of the constants for estimation functions which are normal orders, is presently done by trial and error.  Correct values for these constants are also crucial for exact shooting.
6.Another weird observation is the convergence of the Hardy-Ramanujan-PrimeNumberTheorem log ratio (p/log(p), also known as Merit) estimate after some iterations and this converged integer sometimes matches closely with actual factors. This has happened in earlier logs too.

1. Mysterious convergence of merit p/logp has been investigated.
2. This estimate equates the Prime number theorem merit difference between 2 prime factors and ratio of Prime
counting function and Hardy-Ramanujan prime factors estimate as below:
        l*pf(n+1)/log(pf(n+1)) - l*pf(n)/log(pf(n)) = l*N/(logN * k*loglogN)
3. Earlier the constant multiples k and l were missing in some places which has been rectified.
4. Even after this, previous ratio converges after lot of iterations for l=10 and k=6. So suitable value of l
is still elusive.
5. Two integers with large Omega (usually numbers ending in 5 have lot of factors) have been factored. While
one integer has exact shoot from Hardy-Ramanujan, the other has close shave, but approximate factors are quite
in proximity to actual factors.
6. This establishes utility of ray shooting queries as an Oracle access implementation which can be used both
by classical P and quantum period-finding BQP (P^A versus BQP^A) Factoring Turing Machines which at most requires
O(loglogN) queries.

561. (FEATURE-DONE) Scheduler Analytics Update - New Convolution Network for analyzing stream of 2-dimensional graphics performance image data - 14 June 2018
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pictorial Performance Pattern Mining by Convolution Network:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Input to this Convolution Network is an image bitmap matrix obtained from some standard graphic
performance analyzers - runqueuelat, BPF/bcc-tools, perf etc., Following example image is created
by "perf timechart" on perf.data which captures the state,timeslice etc., information of list of
processes in scheduler at any instant in the form of a gantt chart. Backpropagation-Convolution is
then applied to this performance snapshot and convolution, maxpooling, final neuron layers are
computed as usual. This convolution is iterated periodically for stream of performance snapshot bitmaps.
Advantages of mining graphic images of performances captured periodically are:
       - number of dimensions of a performance snapshot image is 2 while psutils creates 1 dimensional
       array stream of data per process id.
       - 2 dimensional performance snapshots are system wide and capture all process id(s) at a time
       and not process id specific.
       - Recent advanced performance analyzers like BPF/bcc-tools provide a histogram equivalent of
       timechart in perf (runqueuelat) which is also an image bitmap. So support for graphic performance
       data analytics is futuristic.
       - Processing stream of performance snapshot image bitmaps by convolution to extract patterns is
       more universal/holistic than applying convolution to stream of process structure data
       - Specifically if remaining_clockticks-to-processes dynamic hash tables are available as
       stream of histogram images, applying convolution on this stream creates frequent recurring
       patterns of queueing in OS Scheduler (Described in GRAFIT course material:

Berkeley Packet Filtering(BPF)/bcc-tools performance analyzer which includes runqlat is recent addition to mainstream linux kernel from version 4.x.x onwards. Commits prior to April 2018 were done on a linux kernel 4.13.3 + Dual Core development environment which was sabotaged by a probable severe Cybercrime in first week of April 2018 causing catastrophic damage to partitions and hardware failure too making recovery impossible. This incident caused total destruction of all dev and build setups necessitating full checkouts from GitHub and SourceForge repositories and continued development on another base linux kernel of lesser version which does not support BPF/bcc-tools. Previous provision for graphic performance data pattern recognition is mainly targeted towards supporting BPF/bcc-tools in future.

562. (THEORY) Computational Geometric PRAM-NC Factorization, Ray Shooting Query Oracles, Quantum NC, Quantum 
Factorization, Classical-Quantum Transition and Knot Theory - related to 34,351,555 - 15 June 2018 and
18 June 2018
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Earlier sections define various Ray Shooting Query functions on Hyperbolic curve to find approximate factors - 
Hardy-Ramanujan, Prime Number Theorem, Baker-Harman-Pintz, Zhang, Cramer etc.,These Ray shooting functions are
utilized as supporting preprocessing oracles to k-mergesort, local tile search, segment trees based PRAM factorization algorithms - oracles locate prime factors approximately and sometimes exactly in sequential time of O(loglogN). If an oracle ray shooting query succeeds, factorization is over in O(loglogN) steps with no necessity for further pixelation of hyperbolic curve and mergesort/search for factors in PRAM-NC - of parallel time O((logN)^2) or O((logN)^3). If an oracle ray shooting query is approximate, PRAM k-mergesort/search phase of factorization is taken up using the approximate factors queried by ray shooting as beacons - search in vicinity of approximate factor should easily locate the exact factor. Therefore a factorization involving both ray shooting queries and k-mergesort/segment trees/tile search is a problem in complexity class NC^A where A is a ray shooting query oracle in P or NC (if O(loglogN) parallel ray shooting queries are made on O(loglogN) PRAMs in O(1) time). Similar to classical NC, Quantum NC is the class of problems solvable in polynomial size quantum circuits (controlled-U gates, controlled-not gates, Hadamard gates) in polylogarithmic time. There exists an oracle A such that P^A=BQP^A and NC^A is contained in P^A. Also BQP is contained in AWPP i.e. any quantum computation can be simulated by a GapP function f(x) computed by a NPTIME Turing Machine (= number of accepting paths of x - number of rejecting paths of x) such that:
	Pr(M(x) accepts] = f(x)/5^(2*t(x))
for a Turing Machine M(x) in BQP. Since NC is contained in QNC, PRAMs in NC Factorization can be termed as decohered quantum gates in corresponding QNC algorithm. Since Every quantum computation can be transformed into a braid evaluated by Jones Polynomial, an oracle A of Jones Polynomial can be non-constructively shown to exist such that quantum part in a BQP Turing Machine is mapped to a deterministic computation. Theorem 6.1 in reference 562.4 defines such a Jones polynomial PTIME braid oracle A so that BQP is contained in P^A.

Computational Geometric Factorization involves both Parallel and Sequential phases - Pixelating hyperbolic arc bow and k-mergesorting/segment-tree them requires parallel RAMs whereas binary search of k-mergesorted/segment-tree tiles can be done by sequential binary search with no necessity for PRAMs. If each PRAM is replaced by a Quantum Gate, computational geometric factorization can be done in QNC instead of NC which is contained in BQP. Following algorithm maps the mergesort and search of hyperbolic tiles as below and does away with sorting and searching.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pixelated Hyperbolic arc bow as superposition of quantum state pixels
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Set of pixel coordinates in pixelated hyperbolic arc bow can be construed as superposed pixel quantum states each of some amplitude:
	|(p,q)> = B1|(x1,y1)> + B2|(x2,y2)| + ... + Bn|(xO(N),yO(N))>
for complex amplitudes Bi of O(N) coordinate states in pixelated hyperbolic arc. This superposition implies all the coordinates of hyperbolic arc simultaneously have certain probability of being the factor of N. Factorization reduces to maximizing probability of decoherence of this superposition to correct classical factor state |(xl,yl)> i.e xl*yl=N.

Number of distinct prime factors of N = kloglogN for some constant k from Hardy-Ramanujan Theorem. Set of all factors = Set of all multiplicative partitions of N. Average Probability of a coordinate in pixelated hyperbolic arc to be the factor of N = O((Multiplicative Partition Number of N) / N). But square of complex amplitude Bi^2 is the classical probability of a pixel coordinate state |(xi,yi)>. Each state |(xi,yi)> is created by a quantum toffoli multiplication gate and requires 2*logN qubits. Amplitude Bi for each state |(xi,yi)> can be defined as the complex number function of coordinate:
	Bi = f(xi,yi) + i*g(xi,yi)
Classical probability of being a factor of N = Bi^2 which is 1 for factor points. Solving Bi^2 = 1, yields f and g. 

Classical probability ( (modulus(Bi))^2 ) of pixel coordinate state |(xi,yi)> - assumed to be normalized so that
Sum(Bi^2) = 1 - can be defined as below:
        (modulus(Bi))^2 = f(xi,yi)^2 + g(xi,yi)^2 = floor(1 - abs(xi*yi/N - 1))
which is 1 only if xi*yi = N, the factor point, and is 0 if xi*yi/N > 1 or xi*yi/N < 1 , the non-factor points on pixelated hyperbolic arc bow, because floor() makes the enclosing fraction to 0.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Quantum NC equivalent of Classical PRAM-NC Computational Geometric Factorization:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	- Input to the quantum NC circuit is the equation for hyperbola, xy=N
	- Length of pixelated hyperbolic arc bow is O(N) or approximately 1.5N-1
	- For factorization it suffices if each pixel (p,q) in the pixelated hyperbola is input to a 
	quantum gate and it is verified by all gates in parallel if pq=N
	- Succeeding multiplication gates with pq=N find factors p,q in parallel. This is similar to
	multiplication in modular exponentiation subroutine of Shor Factorization (or) a quantum
	multiplication circuit similar to reference 562.7
	- Pixelated Tiles and their pixel coordinates are found in parallel by tiling equation N/(x(x+1))
	- Each multiplication gate for p,q has 2*logN bits inputs - |p| + |q|
	- Number of multiplication gates required < 1.5N-1 (adheres to QNC definition if input size is N and
	not logN)
	- No sorting and search is necessary 
	- Modular multiplication of pixel coordinates (p,q) = pq mod N and verifying it to be 0 is sufficient to conclude p,q are divisors/factors of N. Succeeding Quantum Modular Multiplication Gates have pq mod N = 0 and each modular multiplication gate is of polylogarithmic depth
	- Exact sum of tiles of pixelated hyperbolic arc bow:
	N/(1.2) + N/(2.3) + ... N/((N-k)(N-k+1)) = N*{1/1 - 1/2 + 1/2 - 1/3 + 1/3 - 1/4 + ... + 1/(N-k) - 1/(N-k+1)}
	= N*(1 - 1/(N-k+1)) = N*(N-k)/(N-k+1)
	But tiling ends when N=(N-k)(N-k+1) or N=N^2 - 2Nk + N + k^2 - k
	=> k^2 - k(2N+1) + N^2 = 0
	(or) k = [(2N+1) +/- sqrt(4N^2 + 4N + 1 - 4N^2)]/2
	=> k = [(2N+1) +/- sqrt(4N + 1)]/2 
	=> k ~ N - sqrt(N) + 0.5 = Approximate Number of tiles(arrays of pixels)
	=> Sum of tile lengths = N*(N-N+sqrt(N)-0.5)/(N-N+sqrt(N)+0.5) 
	=> Sum of tile lengths = N*(sqrt(N)-0.5)/(sqrt(N)+0.5) ~ 0.999999...*N for large N
	- Tiling phase also requires Quantum multiplication gates e.g Division in N/(x(x+1)) is converted to a multiplication circuit ([BeameCookHoover] - division reduces to multiplication)

Quantum RAM loads the classical amplitudes of all states - Quoted excerpts - "...If the HHL algorithm could be adapted to the case where (say) a single bi is 1 and all the others are 0, then it would contradict the impossibility of an exponential speedup for black-box quantum search, which was proved by Bennett, Bernstein, Brassard, and Vazirani...". This is relevant in the context of pixel state superposition above i.e if exactly one Bi corresponding to a factor point is made to 1 and all others are 0, factorization immediately follows. HHL algorithm fits well in the context of least squares SAT solver also which maps 3SAT clauses to system of linear equations and finds assignments approximately by solving random matrix equation, Ax=B.

563. (THEORY and FEATURE-DONE) Random 3SAT Approximate LSQR/LSMR Solver update - Increase in Accuracy
- 19 June 2018
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.CNFSATSolver.py has been updated to increase the accuracy of least squares approximation of SAT assignments
by setting atol=btol=conlim=0 as prescribed by SciPy documentation in :
https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.linalg.lsmr.html
Also set the damp to a low value close to zero to solve the 3SAT as regularized least squares problem which is
a generalization of least squares.
2.Random 3SAT instances of 1000 variables and Alpha=1.0 have been solved and MAXSAT approximation ratio for this
converge to ~97% for few iterationsA
3.This increase in accuracy slows down LSMR. But by better least squares optimization which is parallelizable on cloud viz., LSRN - http://web.stanford.edu/group/SOL/software/lsrn/ which is recent parallel algorithm for
solving least squares (LSRN paper - http://web.stanford.edu/group/SOL/papers/lsrn-sisc-2014.pdf) this slow down can be remedied. Invoking LSRN instead of LSMR implies SAT Solver can be executed on cloud.

564. (THEORY and FEATURE-DONE) SAT Solver Update - Randomized Rounding and other linear system of equation solvers - 21 June 2018
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.SAT Solver has been updated to include a special if condition to check if Alpha=1 and directly invoke
linear system of equations solvers instead of least squares regression solvers. Various system of equations
solvers like minres,cg,solve and their variants in ScipPy were tried for number_of_clauses==number_of_variables
 and minres was found to be the best equalling lsmr's accuracy. But they have been commented and lsmr() is
invoked with no regularization damp for Alpha=1
2.Randomized Rounding of the fractional real assignments computed from least squares has been refined. Earlier
the rounding threshold was set to 0.5 which has been generalized to the midpoint of the assignment array ((min + max)/2)
3. This midpoint computation is important because it finds the halfway inflexion point of the polynomial traversing the real assignment points. This polynomial is approximated to a step function of 1s and 0s based on whether the assignment for a variable is above or below half-way mark.
4. Polynomial through the fractional assignment points is sinusoidal and it crosses this midpoint in as many places as there are 0-to-1 and 1-to-0 inflexions.
5. Another randomized rounding scheme is also implemented by computing a pseudorandom fraction between 0 and 1 as
threshold. Midpoint threshold is quite accourate and is mostly 0.5 which is on the expected lines, while values
other than 0.5 are caused because of negative values to some variables in least squares. This follows the usual
randomized rounding convention (e.g for Set Cover).
6. Few Random SAT instances of 1000 variables and Alpha=1 have been computed and MAXSAT approximation ratio has been found to be 97-98% which is captured in logs. In some other executions, this ratio touched even 98.5%
7. Accuracy of randomized rounding threshold is crucial to maximizing MAXSAT ratio.
8. Quantum HHL algorithm solves system of equations Ax=B in logarithmic time while previous classical solvers
are polynomial in clauses-variables. Theoretically this SAT Solver invoking HHL on a quantum computer should be
able to solve SAT NP-Complete problem approximately in logtime and thus in BQ-P (or BQ-NC).

566. (THEORY) Exact Learning of Boolean Functions(e.g absolute CNF) and Intrinisic Merit - 22 June 2018
- related to 529
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Intrinsic Merit problem has been defined as MAXSAT problem earlier assuming there exists an absolute universal
CNF which accepts merit variable values from texts/AVs. Merit variables in this universal CNF are boolean
 based on threshold: if a merit value > threshold, merit variable is 1 and 0 otherwise. For example if graph
tensor neuron network intrinsic merit of a text exceeds a threshold, corresponding variable "intrinsic_merit"
in universal CNF is set to 1. Texts/AVs are ranked by descending order of percentage of clauses satisfied in this
universal CNF which is MAXSAT problem. Problem is how to learn this universal CNF if it exists. There are 
approximate learning algorithms like PAC learning which can learn a concept class approximately correctly
with a bounded error. Traditional exact learning model uses halving algorithm based on membership and 
equivalence queries to gradually shrink the concept class to 1 element. Number of queries required are log|C|.
Membership queries ask an oracle if x is in C and equivalence queries ask an oracle if f(x)=h(x). This halving
algorithm is analogous to interval halving proof of Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem which states that every infinite sequence has a convergent monotone subsequence. Applying this halving procedure to set of all texts and AVs couldexactly learn a universal CNF in logarithmic number of Angluin model membership and counterexample/equivalence 
queries.

3.This upgrade to python 3.4 from python 2.7 is necessitated because:
        3.1 facebook-sdk on python 2.7 requires python 2.7.9
        3.2 But importing facebook-sdk on Python 2.7.9 raises errors related to _ssl and _hashlib (md5,sha etc.,)

569. (THEORY and FEATURE) SAT Solver - Discrete Fourier Transform (FFT) of the real assignment,
Parseval/Plancherel Theorems, Semidefinite Programming Approximation and Least Squares - 3 July 2018
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. SAT Solver has been updated to compute Fast Fourier Transform of the real assignment points for each
random 3SAT.
2. Discrete Fourier Transform of set of points is:
        X(N) = Sum(x(n) * e^(2*pi*n*k/N)), k=0,1,2,...,N-1
X(i) are frequencies and x(i) are discrete points in real assignment vector computed from Least Squares
3. Mapping the real assignment points to frequency domain enables finding periodicity within the real assignments and
applying Parseval/Plancherel Theorems (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform)
4. Parseval Theorem equates the inner product of two vectors to inner product of Fourier Transform Frequencies.
5. Inner product of two assignment vectors (exact binary and real approximate - for values of variables)
is a measure of distance between the exact (if known) and approximate assignments
6. Least Square Approximation solves the system of linear equations AX = B for random 3SAT while Semidefinite
Programming (SDP) solves the Convex Optimization Problem:
                maximize/minimize: Double_Summation(a(i,k)*xi * yk)
                Subject to Constraints: Double_Summation(cl*xi*yk) < bl
7. In other words, SDP solves:
                maximize/minimize: A*X
                Subject to Constraints: C*X < B
                X is a Positive Semidefinite Gramian Matrix having entries from inner product space of vectors
                (or v*X*v^T is non-zero for real vectors v)
8. [Goemans-Williamson] MAXCUT Approximation algorithm - http://www-math.mit.edu/~goemans/PAPERS/maxcut-jacm.pdf -Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery,vol. 42, No.6, November1995 - solves
MAXCUT in ~88% by SDP.
9. Any symmetric matrix can be approximated to nearest positive semidefinite matrix (e.g cov_nearest - http://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.stats.correlation_tools.cov_nearest.html)
10. There is an SDP variation of least squares, Semidefinite Least Squares, which solves the convex program:
                minimize: |X-C|^2
                Subject to: AX=B for positive semidefinite matrix X.
which is similar to least squares solution for variable vector X. X is positive semidefinite because for any real
vector v and some assignment to X, v*X*vT is positive. Minimizing |X-C|^2 for some binary assignment C
finds closest approximation of X to binary step function characterized by C. (Example: https://ljk.imag.fr/membres/Jerome.Malick/Talks/08-louvain.pdf)

570. (THEORY and FEATURE) Computational Geometric Factorization, Ray Shooting Query Oracles, ABC Conjecture
- related to 486, 527, 550, 558 and all other sections on factorization - 6 July 2018
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ABC Conjecture implies there exist finite number of coprime integer triples a,b,c as solutions to diophantine 
equation c=a+b constrained by:
			log(c)
	quality =	------		< 1 + epsilon for all epsilon > 0
			log(rad(abc)) 
radical(N) or rad(N) is the product of distinct prime factors of N (square-free).

Gap between numbers c and a having same prime factors has been conjectured in reference 570.1 as: 
c - a > C(epsilon)a^(0.5-epsilon) which is derived from ABC Conjecture. This is contrasted against the observed
convergence of merit difference in Hardy-Ramanujan-PrimeNumberTheorem ray shooting query oracle:
        l*pf(n+1)/log(pf(n+1)) - l*pf(n)/log(pf(n)) = l*N/(logN * k*loglogN)
which is the approximate gap between merit of n-th and (n+1)st prime factors pf(n) and pf(n+1) of an integer N.
An example factorization and ray shooting query log has been committed which shows actual and ray shooting estimates of factors in 4 of 5 algorithms (Hardy-Ramanujan, Hardy-Ramanujan-PNT, Cramer, Baker-Harman-Pintz) which are in close agreement (off by small distance for most factors) and Hardy-Ramanujan-PNT estimate converges. If c=N1 and a=N2 are two integers having same prime factors, previous Hardy-Ramanujan-PNT ray shooting estimate of gap between prime factors for N1 and N2 is:
        l1*pf(n+1)/log(pf(n+1)) - l1*pf(n)/log(pf(n)) = l1*N1/(logN1 * k1*loglogN1)
        l2*pf(n+1)/log(pf(n+1)) - l2*pf(n)/log(pf(n)) = l2*N2/(logN2 * k2*loglogN2)
rewriting N1 and N2 in terms of merit difference of prime factors:
        (pf(n+1)/log(pf(n+1)) - pf(n)/log(pf(n)))*logN1*k1*loglogN1 = N1 = pf1^s1 * pf2^s2 * ... * pfn^sn
        (pf(n+1)/log(pf(n+1)) - pf(n)/log(pf(n)))*logN2*k2*loglogN2 = N2 = pf1^t1 * pf2^t2 * ... * pfn^tn
	=> N1 - N2 = c - a > C(epsilon)*N2^(0.5-epsilon) if ABC conjecture is true
=> (pf(n+1)/log(pf(n+1)) - pf(n)/log(pf(n)))*(logN1*k1*loglogN1 - logN2*k2*loglogN2) = N1 - N2 > C(epsilon)*N2^(0.5-epsilon)
=> (pf(n+1)/log(pf(n+1)) - pf(n)/log(pf(n))) > C(epsilon)*N2^(0.5-epsilon)/(logN1*k1*loglogN1 - logN2*k2*loglogN2)
which is the approximate lower bound on number of primes between two prime factors of N1 and N2 having same prime factors if ABC conjecture is true.

572. (THEORY) Merit Versus Fame, an example definition of Intrinsic Fitness/Merit in social networks, some
contradictions - 9 July 2018
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Intrinsic Merit-Versus-Fame/Image discrepancy is a well-studied problem in social networks and is the leitmotif of Intrinsic/Absolute Choice versus Majority voting theoretical complexities discussed at length in many sections of this draft. The populist engineering facet of this includes various definitions of intrinsic merit and fame in different disciplines(sports,science etc.,). Bianconi-Barabasi Bose-Einstein condensation phenomenon in social networks occurs when links (particles) accrue in some prominent fittest hub vertices (least energy levels). Defining what least energy implies in social networks is still an open problem. An example definition of Intrinsic Merit function for Bianconi-Barabasi least energy social network profile is described:

Most link-attractive social profiles fall into three disjoint categories:
	-  Wealthy: Affluent/Businesses/Political (W), 
	-  Educative: Oratory/Academic/Science/Research (E),
	-  Valorous: Media/Entertainment/Sportspersons/Heroics (V)

Log-Normal Fitness Attachment (LNFA) Function of previous three, f(W,E,V) = g(W)*h(E)*l(V) formed by multiplication of individual merits in three categories. When a social profile has overlaps with 2 or all 3 of these categories, its ability to attract link increases manifold implying protean all-round nature of profile. E.g Superheroes in fiction/history were versatile and had two or all three. Log Normal distribution is a sum of these random variables and tends to Gaussian by Central Limit Theorem. It remains to define merits in individual categories:
	-  Wealth: Income, Gravity Model based on GDP
	-  Education: Publications, Citations, Degrees, Awards
	-  Valour: Elo Rating, IPR 
Metrics like HDI and SPI already incorporate mixture of these variables. 

Log Normal summation of these three quantities therefore is factor causing links to gravitate towards a vertex thereby relating to least energy as:
	Energy of a Social Profile Vertex ~ 1/(logW + logE + logV) 
=> When the log normal sum of merit random variables tends to maximum/infinity, energy of a vertex is at its nadir. On a side note, these three quantities are interdependent:
	- Education causes Wealth i.e W is a function of E mostly though there are exceptions
	- Valour causes Wealth i.e W is a function of V mostly though there are exceptions

In references below, it is surmised that Fame increases linearly or exponentially with merit. The two contrarian cases when 1) Fame occurs with no merit 2) Merit does not cause Fame, complement this educated guess and is equivalent to group decision correctness probability (p) defined by Condorcet Jury Theorem and Margulis-Russo Threshold when majority function has a sharp transition at p=0.5. For majority to decide correctly (or) for Fame to coincide with merit p has to be atleast 0.5. Margulis-Russo Formula equates derivative of expected value of boolean function for bias p to the Ratio of Sum of Influences of individual variables (voters) and Standard Deviation. In simple terms, this theoretical bound implies Fame or Majority Voting opinion depends on how influential the voters are (i.e how flipping individual preference affects group decision outcome). For majority voting function, this first derivative of Pr[MajorityDecision(N) == Good] or influence is O(sqrt(number_of_voters)) at p=0.5. Both of the previous contrary scenarios occur when bias p < 0.5 which is obvious because the group is prejudiced because all its constituents are prejudiced. Therefore probability of this bias being less than 0.5 has to be quantified:
Probability of per voter bias p < 0.5 for all N voters = (0.5)^N because random variable for p has two values(p >= 0.5 and p < 0.5 both equally probable) and voting is uncorrelated which is exponentially meagre though not impossible. This implies previous Fame-Merit mismatch error occurs with (0.5)^N probability and is infact a converse of Margulis-Russo.

Margulis-Russo threshold d(Pr(Choice=Good=1))/dp on this PageRank version of Majority function is ratio of sum of influences of variables (user websites) to standard deviation which has a phase transition to Good(1) at per-voter website bias p >= 0.5.

575. (THEORY) Computational Geometric Factorization and Parallel Construction of Wavelet Trees - 13 July 2018
- related to 34, 486
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Classical algorithm for Computational Geometric Factorization described earlier is based on storing the pixelatedhyperbolic tile segments in parallelly constructed Interval Trees/Segment Trees and doing stabbing query for factor point N=(p,q) or by k-mergesort of locally sorted tile segments and doing binary search which are O(logN*logN) parallel time. Wavelet Trees are recently gaining prominence as succinct binary search tree data structure for bigdata algorithms like string search, indexing etc., Wavelet Trees are binary search trees having following traits:
	(*) Prerequisite is a set of symbols (alphabets) and sequence of symbols (string)
	(*) Alphabets are divided into two equal sized sets encoded as 0 and 1 
	(*) At root full string is encoded as 0-1 bitmap by previous set encoding for symbols
	(*) Left subtree contains first half of the parent alphabets and Right subtree the second half and encoded as 0-1 by dividing into two sets again
	(*) Previous subdivision of alphabets in each node is recursed encoded as 0 and 1 till single element per node is reached at leaves. 
	(*) Wavelet trees have two operators: rank(c,S,i) and select(c,S,j)
	(*) rank(c,S,i) queries number of occurrences of symbol c in string sequence S till position i. 
	(*) select(c,S,j) queries position of j-th occurrence of symbol c in string sequence S.
	(*) Both rank() and select() are logarithmic time operations traversing the tree from root to leaf.

Binary Search for Factor points N=(p,q) on hyperbolic tile segments can be mapped to wavelet tree:
	(*) Set of all segments of length N/x(x+1) of y-axis endpoints (N/x, N/(x+1)) are concatenated into
a single String sequence in ascending order of y-axis unsorted
	(*) Each element of this unsorted concatenated string is an integer some of which could be factor points
	(*) Alphabets of this string are integers in the vicinity of N in the interval [N-epsilon,N+epsilon] and size of this alphabet is 2*epsilon << N 
	(*) select(N,S,j) queries index k of j-th occurrence of N in this concatenated string which is nothing but a factor point N=(k,N/k) and maximum of value of j = number of factors of N. This selection finds factor in logarithmic time.
	(*) But previous algorithm requires Wavelet Tree construction on PRAMs or Multicores to be in NC and there have been many parallel algorithms for wavelet tree construction mentioned in references.

LevelWT parallel wavelet tree construction algorithm in 575.7 requires O(NlogS) work and O(logS*logN) depth (S is the size of the alphabet and N is size of input). For Computational Geometric Factorization by select() on concatenated unsorted hyperbolic tile segments into one huge string, Parallel Wavelet Tree construction requires O(log(Epsilon)*logN) depth and O(Nlog(Epsilon)) work which implies requiring O(N/logN) PRAM processors. This is far better polylogarithmic depth bound than parallel k-mergesort/interval tree/segment tree which require O(logN*logN) parallel time (depth) minimum. No necessity for sorting the hyperbolic segments is another advantage and Wavelets can store huge strings suitable for factoring very large integers - Each concatenated unsorted hyperbolic segments string is O(N).

580. (THEORY) Random Matrix Least Square SAT Solver, kSAT Sharp Threshold and Friedgut Theorem, ThoughtNet 
Hypergraph as k-SAT problem, TextGraph and Social Network Property Testing - 26 July 2018 - related to 453
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Margulis-Russo Threshold and Condorcet Jury Theorem in the context of Sharp Threshold of Majority Function have
been extensively described earlier. Random Matrix Least Squares SAT Solver has been analyzed and distribution for
choosing a literal has been derived as 1/sqrt(m*n). Similar to Majority Function Sharp Thresholds exist for
kSAT formulae from Friedgut's Theorem which is stated as:
	The satisfiability property for random k-CNF has a sharp threshold, i.e. there exists p' such that for any epsilon > 0, 
	µp(A) → ( 1 if p ≤ (1 − epsilon)p', 0 if p ≥ (1 + epsilon)p' )
	where p' = alpha(n)*n/N.
probability of choosing a clause p is (M=Number of clauses in a random kSAT)/(N=All possible clauses in a random kSAT). Number of all possible clauses in a random kSAT = N = nCk*2^k and alpha = M/n (n is number of variables) => p = (alpha*n)/N.

Probability of choosing a random 3SAT clause in Random Matrix SAT Solver p = [1/sqrt(mn)]^3 = 1/((mn)^1.5). From Friedgut's Theorem number of satisfied clauses increase if p <= (1-epsilon)p'. This leads to inequality:
	1/(mn)^1.5 <= ((1-epsilon)alpha(n)*n)/N
	=> 1/(mn)^1.5 <= [((1-epsilon)alpha(n)*n)*6*(n-3)!]/(8*n!) from N = nC3*2^3
	Simplifying reduces to:
	1/(mn)^1.5 <= [((1-epsilon)alpha(n))*0.75*]/((n-1)(n-2)) from N = nC3*2^3

But mn=alpha(n)*n^2 substituting which reduces the previous inequality to:
	[(n-1)(n-2)/(n^3*(1-epsilon)*0.75)]^0.4 <= alpha(n)

Example - For n=10 and alpha(n)=4.267 previous inequality becomes:
	0.39165/(1-epsilon)^0.4 <= alpha(n)
	=> epsilon <= 0.6154
implying a sharp thresold to increased number of satisfied clauses.

Related note: Sharp Thresholds in k-SAT have some applications in graph representation of texts e.g Definition graphs, ThoughtNet Hypergraph. Any random k-SAT formula can be represented as a hypergraph (Factor graph) of variables as vertices and clauses as hyperedges. ThoughtNet hypergraph is a Factor graph for some k-SAT and extracting the k-SAT from ThoughtNet translates the Contextual Multi Armed Bandit ThoughtNet to a random kSAT instance. Graph representation of texts can be queried for various properties e.g number of matchings, triangles, connected components which extract pattern in the meaning of text. For example, Margulis-Russo threshold is a graph property threshold of atleast n(n-1)/2 random edges between n vertices in a random graph where each edge is created with probability p. Similar threshold holds for Social Network Random graphs.

Draft updates to:

1. Decidability of Complement Functions (2011) - Section on Rice Theorem - https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.4102v1
-------------------------------
Rice Theorem implies every non-trivial property of Turing Machines are undecidable. Non-trivial property is defined as below.

For a non-trivial subset S of recursively enumerable languages which is a non-empty proper subset of all recursively enumerable languages RE(trivial subsets are empty-set and RE):
	581.1 Turing Machine M which accepts a language in S
	581.2 Turing Machine M' which accepts a language in complement of S (RE \ S) 

Previous proofs of undecidability of complement diophantines by Post Correspondence Problem and MRDP theorem are devoted only to the question of existence of a complement function. Since all languages in RE are diophantine, languages which are recursively enumerable but not recursive do not have accept/reject halting Turing Machine to decide diophantine polynomial representation. But Rice Theorem applies in a different setting: Once the set S and its complement RE \ S are known, it is undecidable if an arbitrary Turing Machine M accepts a language in S or RE \ S. In terms of equivalence of RE and Diophantine Equations, it is undecidable if an arbitrary Diophantine Equation represents a set in S or its complement in RE \ S i.e. Given a (complement) diophantine D and 2 complementary sets in RE (disjoint set cover of RE) it is undecidable to decide which set in S or RE \ S are values of diophantine D which is the converse direction of existence of complement diophantine.

For the same reason, Comprehending a Program behaviour is a non-trivial property X which asks "Does the Code do X?". Translating Code to Boolean Formula and applying a SAT Solver (as done in SATURN Program Analyzer) is also a non-trivial property: "Does the Code Satisfy the 3SAT?". Similarly automated debug analytics of code is undecidable too. Software solutions to these are only approximations.

A circular timerwheel hashmap of dynamic sets of timeout clockticks to queues of processes - Survival Index Timeout - has been applied to OS Scheduler in https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/Grafit/blob/master/course_material/NeuronRain/AdvancedComputerScienceAndMachineLearning/AdvancedComputerScienceAndMachineLearning.txt which estimates a non-trivial undecidable property approximately - Worst Case Execution Time of a process.

Licensing Violation is a great problem in Open Source Software (advertently or inadvertently) and Software Similarity Detection provides solutions to identify similar source codes. Mostly available Similarity Detectors parse function and variable names in two source trees and compare similarity but rarely compare the control flow graphs.But Frequent Subgraph Mining of SATURN Control Flow Graphs (static) and Valgrind/Callgrind/KCachegrind Call Graphs (dynamic) in NeuronRain AsFer takes it further solving similarity detection holistically. Third-party Graph Isomorphism Detectors can also be applied on these compiletime and runtime graphs. NeuronRain AsFer also provides indexing of source code and pairwise similarity by Latent Semantic Analysis.

582. (THEORY) Cloud, Autonomous Vehicles, EventNet Logical Clock, Relativity, Lorentz Transform, Lamport's Clock
 - related to 70-86 - 2 August 2018, 3 August 2018
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cloud of autonomus vehicles(e.g drones) in a wireless network are mostly not stationary and each node has a velocity. This relative motion between nodes of a cloud fits in the realm of relativistic time dilation. Lorentz Transform for a stationary and a moving observer with respect to a frame of reference is derived as below:
		
			x1
			|  \ 
			|	\
			V	     \
			x2 -----------> x3

Node x1 in vehicle cloud transmits an information with speed of light c (which is fixed for all observers by Maxwell Equations as 3 * 10^5 km/s) as electromagnetic signal, which is received by both x2 and x3. x2 is stationary and x3 is moving with velocity v. Each node has its own clock t(xi). For x2, information from x1 reaches in t(x2)*c and for x3 information from x1 reaches in t(x3)*c. By this time x3 has travelled t(x3)*v distance from x2. This leads to Lorentz transform below:
		(t(x2)*c)^2 + (t(x3)*v)^2 = (t(x3)*c)^2
		(t(x2)*c)^2 = (t(x3)*c)^2 - (t(x3)*v)^2
		=> (t(x2)*c)^2 = t(x3)^2*(c^2 - v^2)
		=> t(x2)^2 = t(x3)^2*(1 - (v/c)^2)
		=> t(x2) = t(x3)*sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)
		i.e clock of vehicle x3 slows down compared to x2's clock as x3 moves faster. 
Though autonomus vehicles could have speed less than light, if event timestamps are in nanoseconds (C++ provides nanosecond resolution in std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::nanoseconds>), relativistic time dilation could be non-trivial. Lamport's Logical Clock has the causation protocol (s,r):
		sender(s) - transmits timestamp to receiver
		receiver(r) - finds maximum of local timestamp and received timestamp and increments by 1
which is valid only for stationary nodes in cloud and has to be augmented by previous relativistic time dilation transform for moving nodes in cloud. 

Previous time dilation is because of Special Relativity where as General Relativity predicts clocks in objects closer to a heavier mass tick slower. This causes onboard clocks in GPS satellites to tick faster than those on earth slowed down by its mass and corrections are applied. Drones using GPS navigation are directly affected by this. EventNet is a partial ordered directed acyclic graph (infinite) and causality in EventNet Logical Clock (for wireless clouds) is defined by light cone i.e an expanding circular region travelled by light plotted against arrow of time - two events P and Q are causally related if Q is in past lightcone or future lightcone of P and viceversa.

587. (THEORY) ImageNet, EventNet and Recursive Lambda Function Growth and Merit of Large Scale Visuals 
 - ImageGraph Algorithm - related to 249,410 - 10 August 2018
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ImageNet is the pictorial WordNet and has received lot of attention in Computer Vision and Large Scale
Visual Recognition (LSVR) from Images/Videos. Deciding merit of a Video intrinsically with no reputation rankings
has been an open problem (in Fame versus Merit). Recursive Lambda Function Growth algorithm which generalizes
Recursive Gloss Overlap for text-graph creation has been so far restricted only to text analysis. ImageNet
has been applied for Object recognition/tracking based on Convolution Networks in Video datasets (e.g VID). 
This section describes an algorithm to map a video to ImageNet graph of visuals and infer merit from this 
image-graph:
----------------------------------------------
ImageNet-EventNet ImageGraph Algorithm:
----------------------------------------------
	(*) Every Video is set of frames of Images continuously played out in time. 
	(*) Some image frames in the past causally relate to some frames in future in the Video.
	(*) For each image frame:
	{
		(*) Each frame is recognized by a standard LSVR algorithm (e.g ConvNet) and objects are annotated by bounding boxes.
		(*) Each bounded recognized object in a frame is lookedup in ImageNet and an ImageGraph is constructed per frame by computing ImageNet path between every pair of recognized objects and unifying the paths to create an ImageGraph for the frame, similar to WordNet Path s-t connectivity algorithm mentioned earlier for TextGraphs. 
		(*) Merit of Video in human judgement is more than mere connectedness of information conveyed - it also depends on visual appeal e.g object attributes like Angle, Resolution, Lighting, Texture, Aesthetics etc., Edge weights in frame ImageGraph has to reckon these factors.
	}
	(*) Previous loop creates a huge set of ImageGraphs for frames in Video.
	(*) Following EventNet convention, every frame is an Event vertex of set of actors (partakers) in EventNet. Causation between two Event ImageGraphs for chronologically ordered frames F1 and F2 (E(F1) and E(F2)) is determined by causal similarity of the graphs E(F1) and E(F2) i.e if there exist ImageNet paths from vertices of E(F1) to vertices of E(F2) then F1 "causes" F2.
	(*) Example: If frame F1 has recognized visual ImageGraph of a birthday party and F2 has recognized visual ImageGraph of cake-cutting, and if there exists an ImageNet path "birthday - celebration - cake - cutting " ,then E(F1) causes E(F2).
	(*) Previous algorithm converts a Video into a Graph of Graphs (or) Tensor which is a matrix having matriix entries. Size of this video tensor is O(number_of_frames).
	(*) If Audio is also annotated by a Speech Recognition algorithm to text, it catalyses in deciphering causation amongst sets of frames (by creating AudioGraph per set of frames from WordNet and connecting AudioGraphs by WordNet distances and this creates an audio tensor). 
	(*) Once these tensors for video and audio are created, merit is computed by how causally connected these tensors are from standard Graph complexity measures already defined for TextGraphs.

------------------------------------------
ImageGraph Merit as Tensor Products:
------------------------------------------
	(*) Two causally related (having ImageNet path between their vertices) ImageGraphs E(F1) and E(F2) for frames F1 and F2 can be multiplied by Tensor Product which is a cartesian/kronecker product of two adjacency matrices of each ImageGraph per frame - resulting tensor product graph has:
		(*) ImageNet vertex gh for g in V(E(F1)) and h in V(E(F2)) 
		(*) ImageNet edge (a,b)-(c,d) iff edge (a,c) in E(F1) and (b,d) in E(F2)
	(*) the tensor product for two frame ImageGraphs in the Video (which are connected causally by ImageNet) as E(F1) * E(F2) yields a semantic similarity measure between successive chronologically causative frames. e.g edges (birthday, congregation) in E(F1) and (cake, serving) in E(F2) are mapped to edge (birthday-cake, congregation-serving) in the product graph.
	(*) EventNet Causality of ImageGraphs in a Video is represented by an adjacency matrix defined as:
		(*) EventNet matrix EN for a video of N image frames has N rows and N columns
		(*) entry EN(i,j) = tensor product of Event ImageGraph for frame i and Event ImageGraph for frame j if there is an ImageNet path between ImageGraphs for Frame i and j, else, 0
	(*) This EventNet adjacency matrix represents a graph of causality between frames in the video. 
	(*) Weight of every edge (a,b)-(c,d) (or) (ab)-(cd) in tensor product of ImageGraphs for frames F1 and F2, E(F1)*E(F2) (i.e (a,c) in E(F1) and (b,d) in E(F2)) = 1/(d(a,b)*d(c,d)) for ImageNet distance d between two vertices in different ImageGraphs E(F1) and E(F2).
	(*) Previous Inverse Weight implies an edge has more weight in Tensor Product graph if distance between endpoints of edges in two different ImageGraphs are close enough in ImageNet. When either of the endpoints in two different ImageGraphs are not related by ImageNet, d is infinity and respective adjacency matrix entry for tensor product graph is 0.
	(*) Applicability of EventNet to Large Scale Visual Recognition is quite unusual. Necessity of tensor product entries as edge weights in Video EventNet adjacency matrix, than simple scalar weights is because of necessity of capturing distance between every pair of vertices among 2 causally related ImageGraphs - one vertex is in E(F1) and other in E(F2) 

------------------------------------------
Gist and Intuition of previous algorithm
------------------------------------------
Every Video (set of frames) can be mapped to 1) a causation graph of image frame event vertices and 2) each frame event itself is a subgraph of ImageNet - depth 2 graph-of-graphs creation. Causality between frame events is determined by ImageNet distances between vertices in ImageGraphs of the frames represented as tensor product.

588. (THEORY) Analyzing Youtube Videos, Ranking Movies and ImageGraph Tensor Products Algorithm for 
Merit of Large Scale Visuals - 14 August 2018, 15 August 2018 - related to 587
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Analyzing Videos in public domain and Ranking Movies based on merit as opposed to usual human review/reputation 
based rankings is one of the hardest Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge. Algorithm for Mapping Video or Movie to EventNet Graph of frame ImageGraphs and representing EventNet edge weights as Tensor Products has been described earlier.  This algorithm just elicits the graph complexity of visual information contained in the Video overlooking sentimental polarities and psychological impact. Language Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) is a dictionary of human voted words categorized by their human psychological emotions. Classifying the objects in Video or Movie of human viewership therefore demands emotional categories of words. Following changes are made to previous algorithm for quantifying emotions:
	(*) Emotions are mostly verbal and Speech Recognition annotated AudioGraph of Video or Movie Dialogue Transcript are created per frame/scene by union of WordNet paths for all pairs of words in Transcript per frame/scene
	(*) Word Vertices of Each ImageGraph and AudioGraph per frame in Video or Movie are also annotated by the psychological polarity of the Word Vertex in LWIC 
	(*) Weight of every edge (a,b)-(c,d) (or) (ab)-(cd) in tensor product of AudioGraphs and ImageGraphs for frames F1 and F2, E(F1)*E(F2) (i.e (a,c) in E(F1) and (b,d) in E(F2)) is the ordered pair of inverse distance similarity and majority LIWC polarity = (1/(dist(a,b)*dist(c,d)), majority_LIWC_polarity_of(a,b,c,d)) for ImageNet distance dist between two vertices in different ImageGraphs or AudioGraphs E(F1) and E(F2).
	(*) Merit of the Video or Movie in toto is the ordered pair = (Tensor Rank of the AudioGraph and ImageGraph EventNet Tensors, Sorted list of top percentile LIWC polarity of edge weights in ImageGraph and AudioGraph Tensor Products) 
	(*) Computing Tensor Rank is NP-Complete for Finite Fields and NP-hard for Rationals.
	(*) Previous Merit captures both the complexity and emotional content of the Large Scale Visual.
	(*) Tensor Rank is the generalization of Matrix Rank (number of linearly independent rows) = Dimension of Tensor = Minimum number of Tensors Ti to linearly express Tensor T = Sigma(Ti) 
	(*) Most algorithms for Video analysis are caption and statistics based whereas the previous algorithm is a graph theoretic formulation of a machine learning computer vision problem.
	(*) There are recent other alternatives to LIWC e.g Empath.
	(*) Intuition for choice of Tensor Rank as Merit of Large Scale Visuals:
		(*) Tensor Rank of EventNet is the number of Independent n-rows/n-columns of Events in the Video
		where n-columns and n-rows are hypercubes considering Tensor as multidimensional array
		(*) Increased Tensor Rank implies the Events in the Video are more disconnected/independent
		while decreased Tensor Rank implies the Events are more connected/dependent
		(*) Therefore Video of Low Tensor Rank is heavily connected.
	(*) Though applied to Video EventNet, tensor rank has wider philosophical ramifications because EventNet formalizes flow of time logically and has weird implication - EventNet Logical Time Tensor can be written as linear sum of independent tensors and therefore Time tensor essentially is a linear function of finer time subdivision tensors.
	(*) An important difference between Videos and Theoretical EventNet is: Event vertices and participants/actors within an Event vertex can be created in parallel independent of other event vertices in theoretical eventnet (and causality edges between event vertices could be established later in parallel too) while a video (youtube, movie etc.,) is always a serialized set of frames (events) though it could depict concurrent events - video is non-parallel unless more than one video source is simultaneously streamed. EventNet can be formally defined by some Process calculi.
	(*) Usually Like-ing Versus Merit of Videos has the following conflict: Videos or movies which induce viewers to repetitively watch them, garner huge popular support which is not necessarily a reflection of their merit. Music/Audio has an equivalent of this phenomenon known as "Earworm"

1. CNFSATSolver.py has been changed to import gesv, getrs, sysv functions for least squares in cvxopt
2. Each of these were tried for 10 variables and 10 clauses combinations and gesv() has the highest accuracy
observed so far (~99% to 100%) in any of the least squares algorithms.
3. logs for 500 random 3SAT instances have been committed to testlogs/CNFSATSolver.10variablesAlpha1.0.CVXOPT.log.16August2018
4. Caveat: Though the number of variables/clauses are less which could cause repetitive choice of same 3SAT similar randomness did not attain 99% accuracy for other least squares algorithms earlier for similar variable-clause combination.
5. gesv() also throws ArithmeticError for non full-rank matrices and logs for gesv() are filtered-out random 3SAT instances which are full rank. This leaves some random 3SAT instances unsolved.
6. try...except has been changed to print exception stacktrace for ArithmeticError

CVXOPT gesv() has breached the accuracy barrier to large extent from 95-97% to > 99% coinciding with Random Matrix Analysis for 3SAT. But problem is with high number of variables and clauses which do not churn out full rank matrices for 3SAT and lot of instances are left out. So the average is only for full-rank random 3SATs. If this implies P=NP, Polynomial Hierarchy PH collapses to P implying existence of PH-complete problems.

4. callgrind.out files are written to:
	callgrind.DiscreteHyperbolicFactorization_TileSearch_Optimized.out.14531
suffixed by process id.
5. callgrind.out file is viewed by kcachegrind (requires KDE) and call graph is exported as DOT and image files in:
	5.1 kcachegrind_callgraph_DiscreteHyperbolicFactorization_TileSearch_Optimized.png 
	5.2 kcachegrind_callgraph_DiscreteHyperbolicFactorization_TileSearch_Optimized.dot
6. CyclomaticComplexitySparkMapReducer.py has been updated for doing Spark wordcount of both SATURN and Valgrind/Callgrind/KCachegrind DOT Control Flow Graph / call graph files and print Cyclomatic Complexity.
7. This leverages on already implemented Convolution Net Deep Learning of Graphic Performance Patterns by Perf and FlameGraph.

which is the most accurate Least Square Solution. Geometric intuition and preference of L1 norm for least squares is depicted in Q&A: https://www.quora.com/Why-is-L1-regularization-better-than-L2-regularization-provided-that-all-Norms-are-equivalent

2. In the context of SAT, previous minimization implies, the polynomial approximating the binary assignment
heaviside step function is as close as possible to satisfying each clause (because B is unit vector of 1s for
each clause) and sum of real fractional assignments (real parity) is minimum. This can be visualized as a
sinusoidal string pulled on both directions and string settles at an equilibrium curvature which minimizes the
QP above.

3. Prerequisite l1regls from https://cvxopt.org/_downloads/l1regls.py has to be downloaded and PYTHONPATH must be set to it.

4. CNFSATSolver.py has been refactored with if clauses for the least square algorithm invoked. For equal variable-clause "lapack()" invokes gesv() and for unequal variable-clause gels() is invoked

5. Few 1000 variables * 1000 clauses random 3SAT instances have been solved for l1regls() with MAXSAT approximation ratio 96%-97%

6. CVXOPT gesv() has been tested again for 10 variables * 10 clauses and similar MAXSAT approximation ratio of 99%-100% has been observed.  gesv() throws ArithmeticError if A is singular (not invertible, determinant 0) while gels() throws ArithmeticError if A is not full-rank - gesv() is exact solver and gels() is least square solver. (NumPy solve() internally uses lapack gesv). So the logs filter out singular random 3SAT matrices.

594. (THEORY) Horn3SAT and Least Squares Approximate SAT Solver - 7 September 2018
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Horn3SAT is the special case of 3SAT in which each clause is Horn clause having single positive literal known
as Head and all other literals are negative. Horn3SAT is P-complete and is solved by unit propagation algorithm in polynomial time. Unit propagation algorithm has 2 repetitive phases: *) Remove all unit clauses having single literal *) Remove negated literal in all clauses. Horn3SAT can be solved by Least Squares Approximate Solver by creating random Horn3SAT matrix similar to random 3SAT matrix. This random Horn3SAT matrix is very sparse and has only one 1 per row for head literal and all other columns are 0s. Since Horn3SAT is P-complete, there exists a deterministic (and possibly parallel because P-completeness implies NC) algorithm to solve it one of which is unit propagation. Solution to this Horn3SAT random matrix Linear system of equations for equal variable-clause is deterministic polynomial time (gesv() solver can be applied for non-singular instances) while unequal variable-clauses are least squares solvable by algorithms - lsmr/gels/lsqr etc., Cloud algorithms like lsrn can solve Horn3SAT random matrix instance in NC if number of parallel processors are logdepth and polynomial size.

597. (THEORY) Computational Geometric Sequential Factorization Optimization by Wavelet Trees, Tile Summation 
Ray Shooting Queries and Error Probability - related to 506, 575 - 14 September 2018, 15 September 2018,
16 September 2018
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sequential Factorization Optimization by Tile Summation Ray Shooting Queries and searching the epsilon radius
in the vicinity of approximate factors described earlier have the following error probability in failing to
find a factor:

If epsilon radius is O((logN)^l) around an approximate factor, probability of not finding a factor =
	distance between periphery of 2 epsilon radius circles surrounding an approximate factor
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			N/kloglogN

	= [N(m+1) - Nm] / kloglogN - 2q(logN)^l 
	---------------------------------------
			N/kloglogN  

	= N/kloglogN - 2q(logN)^l
	--------------------------
		N/kloglogN

For low error probability, numerator tends to 0:
	N/kloglogN = 2q(logN)^l
	=> l = log(N/2kqloglogN)/loglogN = O(log(N/loglogN)/loglogN) which is exponential.
 
For constant l, probability of error is non-trivial. This epsilon radius vicinity search applies to other ray shooting algorithms too (by replacing Hardy-Ramanujan estimate with the corresponding ray shooting algorithm and equating to tile summation). Advantage of tile summation is it always results in an integral value and coincides with some factor point on xy-plane.

598. (THEORY) Hastad Switching Lemma, Least Squares Approximate SAT Solver, Random Restrictions, CNFSAT
to DNFSAT - 18 September 2018
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Least Squares Approximation by Random 3SAT matrix analysis previously has so far solved almost 99%-100% clauses
(observed) excluding singular random 3SAT matrix instances. This implies binary assignments to some variables 
are not right by randomized rounding of real assignments, falsifying some of the clauses. Hastad Switching Lemma
implies setting values to alpha fraction of variables (restriction) in a CNF(or DNF) formula and evaluating the restricted formula by switching it to DNF(or CNF) and computing its decision tree abides by the inequality:
	Pr[DTdepth(f/alpha) > d] <= (10*alpha*w)^d
for s = sigma*n <= n/5, d >= 0, w is formula width. Least Squares Approximation thus can be construed as restriction generator by following algorithm:
	(*) Solve a random 3SAT matrix by Least Squares (e.g gesv()) 
	(*) Variables in all satisfied clauses in least squares solution form a random restriction - set variables
	(*) Variables in all unsatisfied clauses in least squares solution (excluding variables in satisfied clauses) are made unset variables 
	(*) Switch the restricted CNF3SAT to a DNF3SAT in unset variables
	(*) DNF3SAT is solvable in polynomial time (linear)

The name of the switching lemma stems from the following observation: Take an arbitrary formula in conjunctive normal form, which is in particular a depth-2 circuit. Now the switching lemma guarantees that after setting some variables randomly, we end up with a Boolean function that depends only on few variables, i.e., it can be computed by a decision tree of some small depth d. This allows us to write the restricted function as a small formula in disjunctive normal form. A formula in conjunctive normal form hit by a random restriction of the variables can therefore be "switched" to a small formula in disjunctive normal form...."

601. (THEORY) Algebraic Geometry and Computational Geometric Factorization - some definitions 
- 24 September 2018
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Euclidean Rings are defined as: 
For a,b in ring R, both non-zero, there exist t,r in R such that a=tb + r
where r >= 0. Unique Factorization Theorem is defined on Euclidean Rings. 
Set of Integers are examples of Euclidean Rings.

Let R be a Ring. An Ideal I of R is a subgroup of (R,+) and for all x in I and for all r in R, x.r and r.x in I.
Set of all Integers Z divisible by an integer n is an ideal denoted by nZ. Ideals can be generated by a subset X
of Z. Special case is when X is a singleton X={a} for some a in Z, named Principal Ideal:
	=> aZ = {ar | r in Z}
	and Za = {ra | r in Z}
These ideals are left and right principal ideals generated by X={a} i.e multiples of a.

Every hyperbolic tile segment in Computational Geometric Factorization is the union of intersections of principalideals - one infinite ideal y1*Z parallel to x-axis and other k infinite ideals xi*Z parallel to y-axis in xy-grid (each intersection is a pixel in xy-grid) for xi and y1 in Z - this intersection of principal ideals is finite:
	y1*Z = {y1, y1*2, y1*3,...}
	x1*Z = {x1, x1*2, x1*3,...}
	x2*Z = {x2, x2*2, x2*3,...}
	x3*Z = {x3, x3*2, x3*3,...}
	...
	xk*Z = {xk, xk*2, xk*3,...}

	Tile segment = (x1*Z /\ y1*Z) \/ (x2*Z /\ y1*Z) \/ ... (xk*Z /\ y1*Z)

In Algebraic Geometric terms, a hyperbolic pixelation is union of tile segments (union of union of intersections of principal ideals). Sum of lengths of first n tile segments of pixelated hyperbolic curve:
	N/[1*2] + N/[2*3] + ... + N/[n*(n+1)] = Nn/(n+1)
	N/[1*2] + N/[2*3] + ... + N/[n*(n+1)] <= N/1^2 + N/2^2 + N/3^2 + N/4^2 + ... 
	N/[1*2] + N/[2*3] + ... + N/[n*(n+1)] <= (RiemannZetaFunction(s=2))*N
	N/[1*2] + N/[2*3] + ... + N/[n*(n+1)] <= 1.6449*N

An algebraic subset of Z^2 for hyperbolic variety is defined as (N is number to factorize):
	V(S) = { (x1,y1) in Z^2 | x1*y1 - N = 0 }
which is the point-set on the hyperbolic tile segments (equivalent to previous definition based on principal ideals).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Computational Geometric Hyperbolic tile segments pixelation as Variety over Finite Fields:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Algebraic Varieties are defined as set of zeros of polynomial equations. If K is a Field and N is a positive integer, an affine N-Space over K is defined as:
	A^N(K) = {(a1,a2,...,aN)| a1,a2,...,aN in K}
A subset of affine N-Space is an affine Algebraic Variety over K defined as:
	X(K) = {a in A^N(K)| f1(a) = 0,f2(a) = 0,...,fr(a)=0}
if there are polynomials f1,f2,...,fr having coefficients from K[T1,T2,...,Tn]. In Computational Geometric Factorization, Hyperbolic tile segment pixelation is an affine Algebraic Variety defined over a finite field or Galois Field K of order p^n >> N (p^n is a prime power) satisfying polynomial x1*y1 - N = 0 for (x1,y1) in affine 2-Space A^2(K). Counting number of elements in finite algebraic variety is non-trivial problem - in the context of geometric factorization, this is tantamount to finding number of points in hyperbolic tile segments.

the backend to Theano and predicts objects in an image from ImageNet has been committed to image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/ImageGraph_Keras_Theano.py
4.This script loads an image in keras-theano, converts it to an image array, expands its dimensions and predicts the objects in the image by ResNet50 pre-trained ImageNet dataset. 
5.Predictions for objects in image are decoded into array of tuples of the form (id, imagenet_vertex, probability).

1. audio_features() function in AudioToBitMatrix.py has been updated to compute notes onset from audio signal
2. Notes Onset Detection involves finding peaks in onset strength of the signal time series.
3. Extracting notes from signal converts the music time series to a string from a language of notes alphabets.
4. Most algorithms for audio analysis are time-series (fft,statistics etc.,) based. Considering music as a Formal language opens new vistas into theoretical analysis of music. For example, finding a deterministic finite state automaton for sequence of notes in a music signal is measure of complexity in music.

605. (THEORY) Computational Geometric Factorization, Parallel Planar Point Location, Ray Shooting Queries,
Multisearch, PRAM and BSP models - 2 October 2018 - related to 34, 506, 575, 597
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Factorization by Computational Geometric algorithms - k-mergesort, segment trees, wavelet trees, ray shooting
queries - described earlier implement a generic idiom of Planar Point Location which locates factor points 
inside some of the polygons in the planar subdivision created by the hyperbolic pixel array segments. Planar
Point Location is a special problem in Multisearch which is defined as: Given a set of query points and set of
line segments in 2D plane, multisearch returns the line segments containing the query points which is exactly
what is required in factorization. There are lot of parallel planar point location algorithms for PRAM and BSP
model and thus in NC (references in 34). After locating a pixel array polygon by parallel planar point location, factor can be found by binary search of the segment polygon containing the factor because each hyperbolic segment is implicitly sorted - one of the ordinate axes is constant and other increases i.e each tile is an arithmetic progression. Parallel Planar Point Location algorithm in reference 34.83 can locate a polygon containing factor point in O((logN)^2) PRAM time with additional O(logN) sequential time for binary search to locate the factor within polygon. 

Ray shooting query algorithms described earlier reduce the necessity of parallelism to great extent by making an
educated guess of approximate location of factor points by applying number theory results and search their circular vicinity for exact factors by k-mergesort, segment trees or wavelet trees. Probability of error in ray shooting has been derived earlier. Planar Point Location and Ray Shooting queries can be combined into one by following
algorithm for multisearch:
	(*) Sequentially shoot ray queries for O(loglogN) approximate prime factors with average spacing O(N/loglogN) between rays shot from origin. This is O(loglogN) sequential time (assuming Hardy-Ramanujan estimate)
	(*) Locate the segments (pixel array polygons) containing each of the approximate factors by Parallel Planar Point Location. This returns O(loglogN) segments in O((logN)^2*loglogN) parallel time. With high probability a segment containing approximate factor might also contain exact factor:
                (*) Each tile segment is of variable length N/[x(x+1)] but spacing between prime factors is equalkN/loglogN for some constant k
                (*) Error occurs if  N/[x(x+1)] < kN/loglogN (or) loglogN < k(x(x+1))
                (*) Solving for x in x^2 + x - (loglogN/k) > 0:
                        x > -0.5 + 0.5*sqrt(1 + 4loglogN/k)
	(*) Each O(loglogN) segment(polygon) can be binary searched in O(logN*loglogN) sequential time. 
	(*) Total Parallel and Sequential time of previous 3 steps = O(loglogN + (logN)^2*loglogN + logN*loglogN)
	(*) This is just another sequential optimization which makes some parallel computation sequential. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An average case sequential optimization for removing parallelism in Computational Geometric Factorization:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(*) Average number of tiles between two approximate prime factors m and (m+1) found by ray shooting:
		= (m+1)/[kloglogN - m - 1] - m/[kloglogN - m]
because number of tiles till m-th prime factor = n = m/[kloglogN - m] for m=1,2,3,...,kloglogN
(*) Polygon (hyperbolic tile segment) containing the ray shot approximate factor can be found by equation in 2-level binary search sequential optimization described previously - Tile containing approximate factor point x can be expressed by inequality:
	Nk/(k+1) < x < N(k+1)/(k+2)
	k < x/(N-x)
integer round-off of k is the index of tile interval containing x. This a simple sequential planar point location identity in elementary arithmetic with no necessity for PRAMs or BSP.
(*) Each consecutive tile in N/kloglogN spacing between approximate factors can be found by tiling equation N/[x(x+1)] - subtract y coordinate by N/[x(x+1)] and increment x coordinate by 1 or vice versa - and each of these tiles in N/kloglogN spacing can be individually binary searched in O(logN).
(*) Thus total average sequential time to sweep binary search tiles in N/kloglogN spacing between 2 consecutive approximate factors found by ray shooting:
	= O([(m+1)/[kloglogN - m - 1] - m/[kloglogN - m]] * logN)
(*) Maximum number of tiles in N/kloglogN spacing occurs by setting m=kloglogN - 2 (because of geometric intuition of hyperbolic tiling, most tiles occur within an interval in topmost or rightmost extreme of hyperbolic arc which contains kloglogN-th factor on either axes):
	= O([(kloglogN - 2 + 1)/[kloglogN - kloglogN + 2 - 1] - (kloglogN - 2)/[kloglogN - kloglogN + 2]])
	= O(kloglogN - 1 - (kloglogN - 2)/2)
	= O(kloglogN)
=> Maximum time to binary search tiles in N/kloglogN spacing = O(loglogN * logN)
=> Each of O(loglogN) spacings between approximate factors can be searched in: 
	O(loglogN*loglogN*logN)
average case sequential time with no necessity for parallel processing.

606. (THEORY and FEATURE) VideoGraph EventNet Tensor Product Merit for Large Scale Visuals - 3 October 2018
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Two new functions have been committed to ImageGraph_Keras_Theano.py for reading a Video file, extracting
frames from the video upto certain number and extract object information by Keras-Theano ImageNet predictions
for each frame.
2. imagenet_videograph() function depends on OpenCV 3.4.3 (cv2) Python for reading Videos and writing Frame
JPEG files suffixed by unique id. Each frame is mapped to a TextGraph - ImageGraph - by imagenet_imagegraph()
3. videograph_eventnet_tensor_product() function computes tensor products of pairs of Frame ImageGraphs and
returns an EventNet Tensor from NetworkX. 
4. logs, an example Video (MP4) and 2 sample extracted frames (JPEG) for EventNet Tensor representation of
a video have been committed to testlogs/ImageGraph_Keras_Theano.log.3October2018 
5. From this EventNet Tensor any kind of intrinsic merit can be computed - e.g previously described ImageNet based inverse weights, Graph Edit Distance between two Frame ImageGraphs, Tensor Rank for connectedness etc.,

607. (THEORY and FEATURE) Video EventNet Tensor Products - Inverse Distance Merit of Large Scale Visuals
- 4 October 2018
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.New function inverse_distance_intrinsic_merit() has been included in ImageGraph_Keras_Theano.py. It
iterates through each tensor product entry of Video EventNet Tensor Products matrix and for every edge
(a,b)-(c,d) in tensor product computes inverse wordnet distance (which is basis for ImageNet):
        1/dist(a,b)*1/dist(c,d)
and populates a weights matrix per tensor product graph.
2.Each tensor product in EventNet Tensor corresponds to causality between any 2 frames in the video.
3.An example merit computation log has been committed to testlogs/ImageGraph_Keras_Theano.log.4October2018
which shows merits for 4 tensor products (2 frames * 2 frames).
4.Lot of weights in merit matrix in logs have huge values implying high causality between two frame events.
5.EventNet Tensor Product Algorithm is computationally intensive. Each ImageGraph per frame encodes relationship
between objects (actors) in the frame event.
6.Size of the EventNet Tensor is O(number_of_frames * number_of_frames * average_number_of_actors_per_frame * average_number_of_actors_per_frame) and memory intensive too.

608. (THEORY and FEATURE) Video EventNet Tensor Products - Emotional Merit of Large Scale Visuals 
- 15 October 2018
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. EventNet Tensor Product representation of a Large Scale Visual just infers the connectedness of the
information in the video with no emotional or sentiment scoring.
2. To redress this, new function has been included in ImageGraph_Keras_Theano.py to lookup the edges of
tensor product graph in empath and aggregate the sentiments of the vertices as a tuple which is qualitative emotive merit of the video.
3. Two new example visuals have been added: ExampleImage_1.jpg and ExampleVideo_2.mp4 in addition to earlier
ExampleVideo_1.mp4 and images.
4. Keras has mistook ExampleImage_1.jpg to be a theatre audience which is indeed a classroom photo and annotated
it accordingly (probably because seating and ambience are similar in both). Also Empath has misjudged the alumni website content in ExampleVideo_2.mp4 to large extent excluding "college" as emotional annotation. Logs have been committed to testlogs/ImageGraph_Keras_Theano.log.15October2018 
5. These Photo and Videos are courtesy (and related to self):

609. (THEORY) EventNet Tensor Products - Example for Movie and Youtube Merit - 16 October 2018
- related to 608
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Previous videos were proof-of-concept implementations for utility of EventNet Tensor. Following is stated just as a theoretical example with no testcases because computation involved is massive requiring millions of frames and their EventNet Tensor Product - EventNet Tensor Products Algorithm can be applied to set of movie/youtube datasets to deduce the connectedness and emotions in the videos. Since most movie and youtube channels are emotions oriented which are expressed visually, comparing the emotion annotated tuples (e.g by Empath previously described) of any pair of movies/youtube videos, could rank them by emotional quotient approximately. Also the previous Empath emotion annotation creates a set of emotions and not a hashmap of emotion annotations to their number of occurrences in the Audio-Visual which is yet another indicator. Comparing emotions occurrence hashmaps of two Audio-Visuals is a ranking measure - requires sorting two hashmaps by emotions occurrence values, comparing top percentile emotions in two Audio-Visual hashmaps and finding correlation coefficient between the two probability distributions. Added advantage could be speech recognition in the AV frame-by-frame or for set of frames which is not done by previous Keras-Theano implementation and creating AudioGraph from it (there is no AudioNet library so far).

and 20 October 2018
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guessing/Discovering a Larger EventNet causality Graph from Subgraphs of EventNet has been mentioned earlier.
An opposite of it is to summarize a huge EventNet Graph into a small summary EventNet subgraph without much
loss of causality information. Text Summarization is text analysis application of Graph Summarization which has been earlier described and implemented by Recursive Lambda Function Growth algorithm. Realworld application of 
Graph Summary is Video Summarization by EventNet Tensor Products representation e.g a movie or a youtube video is a small duration summary (minutes or hours) of real life events (and their causalities) enacted by set of people over many years - this involves sampling an EventNet Tensor Product Graph of a Video at relevant vertices and induce a summary subgraph on it which preserves meaning. Similar to Text Summarization, Video Summary could also be approximated by choosing dense subgraphs (or high core number vertices) of Video EventNet Tensor Products. Topological Sort of Dense Subgraph of Video EventNet Tensor Product Graph gives a flattened summary of the video by some ordering (a gist of important frames).

- related to 611
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(*) Empath emotions of the Video EventNet Tensor Products Graph have been aggregated in a hashmap. This facilitates quantitative emotional scoring of the video. Hashmap correlates the empath emotion and its cumulative score. 
(*) Core (Main core) of the Video EventNet Tensor Product Graph has been computed and is sorted topologically for creating some ordering for the summary. 
(*) New example MP4 video has been created from 6 JPEG photos (in which I was present) and google search related to self (ExampleVideo_3.mp4) :

(*) Some errors in inverse distance merit computation of the Video EventNet Tensor have been corrected which
was earlier a 2-dimensional tensor and has been made 3-dimensional in this commit.
(*) Core Summary of the Video has also been changed to compute maximum merit for each tensor product inverse
distance merit vector and apply a threshold filter for the distance merit.
(*) Three dimensional EventNet Tensor is mapped to NetworkX Graph after previous threshold filter.
(*) Only causal frames above inverse distance threshold are included in the NetworkX graph and main core is computed on this graph

613. (FEATURE) People Analytics - HR Analytics Implementation and Least Energy Intrinsic Merit of a 
social profile - 9 November 2018 - related to 365, 443, 572
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(*) People Analytics is the generalized version of HR Analytics for analyzing any social profile vertex.
(*) This commit adds SocialNetworkAnalysis_PeopleAnalytics.py python implementation to repository which
at present analyzes LinkedIn profiles and computes:
	(*) Graph Tensor Neuron Network Intrinsic Merit of the profile text with no field parsing - this treats
the social profile as an en masse text with no delineations and applies Recursive Lambda Function Growth algorithm to create lambda function composition tree of the resume text. Core classification and Centrality measures throw some interesting insights:
		(*) Core number 4 identifies the class of the social profile 
		(*) Maximum merit random walk of the lambda composition tree approximately guesses the purport
of the text in the social profile
		(*) Betweenness and Closeness Centralities estimate the top-ranked classes accurately compared to Degree and PageRank Centralities
	(*) Log Normal Fitness of the social profile after parsing the total work experience and academic
stints of the profile - for linkedin this inverse log normal least energy fitness is 1/(logE + logV) with no Wealth estimates - Wealth is caused by E(Education) and V(Work/Valour) as far as professional profiles are concerned. Lowest Value of Least Energy Fitness implies Highest Fitness. Parsing is done by parse_profile() function which implements a switch design pattern - stint polymorphs from work to academic tenures.
	(*) Log Normal Experiential Intrinsic Fitness of the social profile (by applying mistake bound learning differential equation for recursive mistake correction tree described earlier) - log normalized because of huge exponents
(*) Because of limitations due to Updated LinkedIn Scraping Policy (https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2017/09/20/linkedin-vs-hiq-ruling-casts-a-long-shadow-over-the-tech-industry/#19f535f35e6c), this is only implemented as a non-crawled example for LinkedIn profile of self: https://www.linkedin.com/comm/in/srinivasan-kannan-608a671 (pdf and text version of pdf by pdf2txt)
(*) datetime python package is used to compute timedelta(s) and a regex matcher isdaterange() function has been implemented for parsing date ranges in the profile:
	(*) Work Experience Date Ranges have the Regex: <Month> <Year> - <Month> <Year>
	(*) Academic Date Ranges have the Regex: <Year> - <Year> and months are implicit
(*) This implementation does not assume a Web Crawler and Social Profile Datasource and only requires a file input (datasource, file type and file name are passed in as arguments to parse_profile()) - optionally, crawled social profiles can be invoked as file arguments to parse_profile(). Presently only linkedin datasource, text file types are supported. PDF parsing has been implemented by PyPDF2 but there are IndirectObject related errors.

Theory:
-------
An obvious application of HR analytics is feasibility of automatic recruitment of people by profile analytics. Usual Interview and Written Test based process of recruitment measures Intrinsic Merit (approximately subject to error) of people. Analytics of Professional Networks is Fame (Degree etc.,) based. From 572.8 ("...Boolean majority function is equivalent to PageRank computed for 2 candidate websites on (n+2)-vertex graph (n user websites choose between 2 candidate websites - Good(1) and Bad(0), choice is fraction of outdegree from a user website) normalized to 0 (smaller pagerank) and 1 (bigger pagerank). Margulis-Russo threshold d(Pr(Choice=Good=1))/dp on this PageRank version of Majority function is ratio of sum of influences of variables (user websites) to standard deviation which has a phase transition to Good(1) at per-voter website bias p >= 0.5..."). Majority Voting/PageRank or any other Fame/Degree measure is known to have phase transition from Low accuracy to High accuracy for per voter p-bias > 0.5 implying automatic recruiting is feasible if Fame lowerbounds Intrinsic Merit (Intrinsic Merit >= Fame). Stability or Resilience of Interview as LTF vis-a-vis Majority Function has been analyzed earlier in 365. Problematic condition for rendering automatic crowdsourced recruitment infeasible is: Intrinsic Merit << Fame. Comparison of Intrinsic Merit to Fame by correlation coefficients requires normalization of fame and merit rankings e.g fame and merit probability distributions and distance between these two distributions for same dataset. From references in 572, most experimental results in sports(e.g Elo rating), science (e.g research published) etc., show fame grows exponentially to merit implying merit is quantitatively proportional to log(Fame). For example, if PageRank/Degree centrality is computed on Professional Network Vertices and dynamic experiential intrinsic merit E of a profile at time point t is computed by previous implementation:
		E = M*e^(kMt) = log(dv(t)) * e^(klog(dv(t))*t/clogt) / clogt for evolving degree dv(t)
crowdsourcing infeasibility condition reduces to:
		log(dv(t)) * e^(klog(dv(t))*t/clogt) / clogt << dv(t)
		(klog(dv(t))*t/clogt) << log(clogt * dv(t) / log(dv(t)))

615. (THEORY) Hash Table Chaining, Locality Sensitive Hashing and Frequently occurring patterns - 13 November
2018 - related to all sections on LSH partitions, Majority Voting, Theoretical EVMs, Streaming, 
Audio-Visual Pattern Mining, Bigdata Analytics
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Locality Sensitive Hashing is a collision-supportive hash chaining which as described earlier has multitude
of applications in clustering similar elements of a set which can be votes for candidates(EVMs which colocate votes for a candidate in same bucket), bigdata or audio-visual spectrogram-histogram representation. Essentially, every chained hash table or LSH partition of a set is a histogram of probability distribution when viewed pictorially - e.g audio signals represented as series of animated histograms. Assuming dataset is a stream of these LSH partitions, problem is to decipher patterns underlying these histograms. There are LSH algorithms like Nilsimsa hash, Minhash etc., which find similarities of two sets (texts for example in Nilsimsa) by Jaccard, Hamming and other distance coefficients. If each element in the stream of histograms/LSH partition/Chained Hashtable are considered as set of buckets, comparing two such histograms is tantamount to computing similarity of 2 consecutive sets of buckets by some hash metric e.g Minhash. It is worthwhile to mention that this histogram (set of buckets) pattern is ubiquitous across any algorithm doing an LSH partition or hash table bucket chaining. In the People Analytics example previously, LSH partition of People and Professional Profiles splits them into buckets of similar traits.

Distributed Hash Tables which geographically decentralize chunks of a huge table realise theoretical Electronic Voting Machines which have been defined earlier in terms of LSH partitions or Separate Chaining Hash tables in distributed/cloud setting - buckets of votes for candidates are distributed on cloud nodes. CAP Theorem applies to Theoretical EVMs implying only 2 of 3 (Consistency-serialization, Availability-readwrites are 100% reflected and Partition Tolerance-resilience to node/network failures) are feasible on an internet EVM based on LSH Partition/Separate Chaining. Real world EVMs are most vulnerable to network, sabotage or power failure (partition) making it a CA system.This limitation is less visible if number of candidates is small and table is local but serious if number of candidates (buckets) are huge and requires distribution. Even if partitions are assumed to be nil, there is always a tradeoff between consistency and latency i.e a distributed system has to compromise on speed for greater consistency. This has been formalized as extension of CAP Theorem - PACELC theorem.

Example:
If profiles are represented as TextGraphs as in previous implementation of HR Analytics, edges between vertices of the textgraph encodes the temporal information because most social profiles contain chronologically ordered timeline history of events - similarity measure for any two profiles could be the temporal cause-effect similarity between two profiles and thus Social Profile TextGraph is an EventNet too.

617. (THEORY) Beatty Sequences and Complement Diophantines - related to all sections on Complementary Sets
,Ramsey 2-coloring and their Diophantine/Function representations - 16 November 2018, 18 November 2018 - draft updates to 
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.4102v1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Complement Functions have been defined for arbitrary complementary sets (Integers/Rationals/Reals) in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.4102v1 and their relevance to Ramsey Coloring of Sequences and decidability of Diophantine representation of complementary sets (MRDP Theorem) have been expounded in detail earlier. Special Case of Complementary Sets of Integers is a well-studied problem and a classic result due to Beatty defines 2 complementary sets of integers based on solutions to equation 1/a + 1/b = 1 for irrationals a and b. Thus terminologies - Complement Functions, Complement Diophantines, Ramsey 2-Coloring of Sequences and Beatty Complementary Sequences - are synonymous with respect to set of Integers Z. Notion of Complementation generalizes it to any sets Boolean, Integer, Real or Rational. Integer and Real Complementation have solvable algorithms in the form of Diophantine equations subject to MRDP theorem and Tarski/Sturm, but complementation over rationals is open problem for the direction N to Q - mapping Q to N is straightforward. 

ABC Conjecture and Complement Diophantines:
-------------------------------------------
ABC conjecture states there are finite coprime triples a,b,c such that a+b=c and quality(q)=log(c)/log(rad(abc)) > 1 + epsilon for every epsilon > 0. Though there are infinitely many coprime triples a,b,c (a+b=c) having quality > 1, this conjecture predicts there are only finite number of coprime triples cluttered between every real value of epsilon. Complementary version of ABC conjecture is defined as:
	(*) T = set of all coprime triples (a,b,a+b=c)
	(*) Q1 = set of all coprime triples of quality > 1
	(*) Q0 = set of all coprime triples of quality < 1
	(*) Q0 U Q1 = T and Q0 /\ Q1 = Empty i.e sets Q0 and Q1 are complementary infinite sets (creates Beatty sequences equivalent for triples).
	(*) Complementary Sets Version of ABC Conjecture: Infinite set of triples Q1 is the disjoint set cover or exact cover of finite sets of triples of quality 1+epsilon for every real epsilon.
	(*) Previous complementary sets can be picturised as:
		(*) T is a Rubik's cube in which each ordinate is a coprime triple (a,b,c) 
		(*) Q0 and Q1 partition T into two disjoint sets of qualities less than 1 and greater than 1.
		(*) Q1 is the 3 dimensional half-space of Cube tiled by finite sets of triples of quality 1+epsilon for every real epsilon. As mentioned earlier, Pentominoes tiling is an exact cover problem for 2 dimensions.

Because set of integers in binary notations can be expressed by binomial coefficients (a is number of 1s and b is number of 0s, a+b is the length of the binary integer string, (a+b,b) is the number of all possible integers having b 0s in binary representation), Kummer's theorem is widely used for exponential diophantine representation of arbitrary recursively enumerable sets.

- related to 443
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.SocialNetworkAnalysis_PeopleAnalytics.py has been changed to parse connections of a linkedin profile
2.Number of connections of a profile is then used to compute experiential intrinsic merit based on degree of
a vertex as:
    E = M*e^(kMt) = log(dv(t)) * e^(klog(dv(t))*t/clogt) / clogt for evolving degree dv(t)
3.This identity is derived from exponential relation between Fame (Degree) and Merit (Intrinsic fitness) of a
social profile - in https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/First-to-Market-is-not-Everything-an-Analysis-of-Preferential-Attachment-with-Fitness.pdf (described earlier)
4.Previous relation is anachronistic in the sense merit is defined in terms of fame when it has to be other way around. Function for experiential_intrinsic_merit() takes number of connections as a parameter and branches off into two clauses for least enery log normal merit if degree is 0 and degree based merit for degree > 0.
5.Example LinkedIn Profile Connections (committed in pdf and txt) have been analyzed for previous degree based
experiential merit and Recursive Lambda Function Growth merit. Example linkedin Connection pdf and text file have been committed to:
	ConnectionsLinkedIn_KSrinivasan.pdf
	ConnectionsLinkedIn_KSrinivasan.txt
6.Definition TextGraph of connections (.txt) extracts essence of the aura surrounding a social profile.
7.Dense subgraph (core) of this connections textgraph is a clustering coefficient measure i.e how well the neighbours of a vertex have semantic connections among themselves. 
8.Though social profiles are prone to Sybil links for artificially bumping up popularity, previous analysis is
based on the assumption that humans do not link to another human unless they are trusted/befriended.
9.logs for this have been committed to:
	SocialNetworkAnalysis_PeopleAnalytics.log.20November2018 (degree experiential merit)
	SocialNetworkAnalysis_PeopleAnalytics.log2.20November2018 (recursive lambda function growth merit)
10.Recursive Lambda Function Growth merit logs have been truncated because of following recursion depth error in bintrees AVL Tree:
	RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded
but the logs show few erratic cycles having "missiles" which are inferred from random walk paths printed in the logs. Also Names of the connections have not been filtered which misleads the WordNet. Previous error impedes full analysis based on core number. But there are some relevant cycles related to "head hunter","Ph.D","dissertation","entrepreneur","engineer","managers","information_technology" etc., giving a glimpse of the social circle's nature.

Comparing call graphs by Graph Isomorphism or Graph Non-Isomorphism deduces code similarities. This is somewhat counterintuitive surprise to Program Equivalence Problem which is undecidable implying isomorphism detection is only an approximation. Program Equivalence essentially asks if two Turing machines accept same language (equivalent).

Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg] - A Game-Theoretical Approach for Finding Optimal Strategies in a Botnet Defense Model - "...Botnets are networks of computers infected with malicious programs that allow cybercriminals/botnet herders to control the infected machines remotely without the user's knowledge. In many cases, botnet herders are motivated by economic incentives and try to significantly profit from illegal botnet activity while causing significant economic damage to society. To analyze the economic aspects of botnet activity and suggest feasible defensive strategies, we provide a comprehensive game theoretical framework that models the interaction between the botnet herder and the defender group (network/computer users). In our framework, a botnet herder's goal is to intensify his intrusion in a network of computers for pursuing economic profits whereas the defender group's goal is to defend botnet herder's intrusion. The percentage of infected computers in the network evolves according to a modified SIS (susceptible-infectious-susceptible) epidemic model. For a given level of network defense, we define the strategy of the botnet herder as the solution of a control problem and obtain the optimal strategy as a feedback on the rate of infection. In addition, using a differential game model, we obtain two possible closed-loop Nash equilibrium solutions. They depend on the effectiveness of available defense strategies and control/strategy switching thresholds, specified as rates of infection. The two equilibria are either (1) the defender group defends at maximum level while the botnet herder exerts an intermediate constant intensity attack effort or (2) the defender group applies an intermediate constant intensity defense effort while the botnet herder attacks at full power...." - FTrace analyzer in NeuronRain for kernel callgraphs provides a streaming delta-debugging feedback on rate of infection e.g delta changes (frequent call subgraphs in evolving SIS graph) in malicious patterns of infected kernels thus aiding a strategy.

620. (THEORY) Space Filling, Separate Chaining Hash Tables, Theoretical EVMs, Timeout, Balls-and-Bins, Linear
 Programming, Program Analysis, Cellular Automata, Majority Hardness Amplification Lemma - 30 November 2018, 1 December 2018, 2 December 2018, 28 January 2019 - related to 135, 517, 615
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Space Filling has been defined in terms of Linear Program in https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/Analysis%20of%20a%20Randomized%20Space%20Filling%20Algorithm%20and%20its%20Linear%20Program%20Formulation.pdf and its cellular automaton algorithm version has been described earlier. This linear program with constraint that every variable is non-zero:
		x1 + x2 + ... + xn = N, for all xi > 0
is isomorphic to an LSH set partition, Integer Partition or Separate Chaining hash table partition of n parts of a set of N items. In most scenarios this is a restricted partition. Separate Chaining and Balls-Bins problems are equivalent if buckets are filled at random. Following are some of the probability estimates for Balls-and-Bins problem:
620.1 Average number of balls in a bin = n/b (n balls and b bins)
620.2 Number of balls to toss till a bin contains a ball:
	probability of ball/item landing in a bin/bucket q=1/b, p=1-q
	Number of tosses till success is Bernoulli trial geometric distribution
	For success after kth ball toss, bernoulli probability: p^(k-1)q
	Since k is a random variable, E(k) = Sum over k*p^(k-1)q = b
620.3 Number of balls tossed till every bin has a ball:
	Total number of bins = b
	Number of balls n is partitioned as n1 + n2 + n3 + ... + nk = N for each stage of tossing.
	After ith stage, number of bins having atleast one ball = i-1
	Number of remaining buckets = b-i+1
	Probability of a toss landing in remaining buckets in ith stage = (b-i+1)/b
	Each ni is a random variable of probability = b/(b-i+1)
	Sum of E(ni) < O(blnb) before every bin has a ball.
Balls and Bins have histogram representation and previous bounds apply to histogram patterns too. In the context of theoretical EVMs if every voter votes perfectly at random with no prejudice to a candidate, number of
voters required  for every candidate to have atleast 1 vote = O(blnb) for b candidates. Course material in (https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/Grafit/blob/master/course_material/NeuronRain/AdvancedComputerScienceAndMachineLearning/AdvancedComputerScienceAndMachineLearning.txt) describe a separate chaining hashtable timeout based OS scheduler pattern and similar bounds apply - Number of processes required for atleast one process per timeout value = O(blnb). Previous linear program version of separate chaining if solved by Balls-and-Bins has similar bounds - O(n*ln(n)) for solving LP of n variables.

To ensure secrecy of balloting, every vote appended to a candidate bucket in Theoretical Separate Chaining EVM has to be mapped to a unique one time randomly generated numeric id obfuscating the voter identity (and each bucket is encrypted). Mining patterns in this anonymous dictionary elicits only voting patterns and not voter patterns. Majority version of hardness amplification lemma described earlier envisages a MajorityInverse() function which inverts Majority+VoterSAT Boolean function composition for 2 candidates and obtains voters voting for a candidate and per voter SAT assignments top-down. Hardness of this MajorityInverse() is crucial to prove amplification. Theoretical EVM for 2 candidates is exactly separate chaining/LSH version of Majority gate of binary inputs 0 and 1 and Majority() and MajorityInverse() are defined as: 
	- Majority(): candidate of maximum sized voters bucket
	- MajorityInverse(): voters bucket for a candidate
Intriguingly, MajorityInverse() is palpably easier in this separate chaining/LSH version of majority gate but previous anonymizer rules out easy inversion. Voter is issued a receipt containing the encrypted ciphertext of the candidate bucket index his/her vote is appended to. Encrypted receipt of vote issued to voter is more reliable than VVPAT which is in plaintext and not voter-received. Ballot secrecy is not compromised because this encryption is as secure as any other ciphertext transmitted over the network by public key infrastructure. Only authority accountable for conduct of voting can decrypt the receipt in case of disputes.

Vulnerabilities include unencrypted ballot definition file tamper, Safety of Protective Counter storing number of votes polled, Party Affiliation tamper etc., - "...On a potentially much larger scale, if the voting terminals download the ballot definition over a network connection, then an adversary could tamper with the ballot definition file en-route from the back-end server to the voting terminal; of course, additional poll-worker procedures could be put in place to check the contents of the file after downloading, but we prefer a technological solution. With respect to modifying the file as it is sent over a network, we point out that the adversary need not be an election insider; the adversary could, for example, be someone working at the local ISP. If the adversary knows the structure of the ballot definition, then the adversary can intercept and modify the ballot definition while it is being transmitted. Even if the adversary does not know the precise structure of the ballot definition, many of the fields inside are easy to identify and change, including the candidates’ names, which appear as plain ASCII text...". In the context of theoretical EVMs on cloud defined previously based on LSH/Separate chaining, these encryption prerequisites are relevant in addition to CAP theorem limitations and PACELC theorem consistency versus speed trade-off. Per-candidate vote counters are replaced by hash table buckets which have to be secured. History preserving VVPAT audit trails require linking voters to votes which is obviously evident from per-candidate vote buckets. Frequent item set mining (e.g FPGrowth) of EVM buckets could point to malicious and suspicious voting patterns which is not feasible in counter increment.

621. (FEATURE) Social Network Analysis - People Analytics - Dictionary filter for names - 4 December 2018
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.RecursiveGlossOverlap_Classifier.py has been changed to define a new function nondictionaryword() for filtering nondictionary words. This is necessary for parsing text of Social Profiles which contain names in SocialNetworkAnalysis_PeopleAnalytics.py. Finding names in text is an open AI problem which comes under the purview of Named Entity Recognition (NER) which often requires CRF or Neural Network Training models.
2.As an alternative to statistical learning, if a word in text is not in a language Dictionary it is assumed to have exited any semantic network (WordNet for English etc.,) which could be names of people, places etc., But there are some exceptions to this and countably few names are in language dictionaries and encyclopedia.
3.Function nondictionaryword() looksup a word in PyDictionary which is based on WordNet, Google Translation, Thesaurus.com and returns true or false based on language dictionary. If for a word lookup null meaning is returned, it is outside Semantic Network and nondictionaryword() returns true.
4.Depth of the Recursive Gloss Overlap recursion has been parametrized in RecursiveGlossOverlap_Classifier.py and RecursiveLambdaFunctionGrowth.py and invoked in SocialNetworkAnalysis_PeopleAnalytics.py for depth 2.
5.WordNet and ConceptNet consist of network of concepts than textual words. PyDictionary has additional support for other datasources - Google Translation and Thesaurus - specific to language words.

2.New source file WordSubstringProbabilities.py for computing word prefixes and suffixes probabilities by FreqDist has been committed which parses English Wordlist from Dictionary.txt into two probability distribution dictionaries for prefixes and suffixes.
3.Function wordprefixsuffixprobdist() in WordSubstringProbabilities.py called in TextCompression.py has been  nominal because of computationally intensive Maximum Likelyhood Estimator in Hidden Markov Model (likelydict) and hardcoded priors are used.
4.Logs for this commit have been committed to WordSubstringProbabilities.log.6December2018 and TextCompression.log.6December2018.gz
5.compressedtext.txt and decompressedtext.txt have been updated
6.MLE likelydict is O(prefixes*suffixes) = O(number_of_words^2*length_of_longest_word^2) is costly one time disk read and might require some memcache-ing during initialization.

623.(THEORY) Arithmetic Circuit Complexity, Diophantine Complexity, Universal Diophantine Equation, ABC
Conjecture, Complementary Sets, Diophantine Representation of Complementary Sets, Proof Complexity - 7 December 2018, 8 December 2018 - related to 617
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Arithmetic Circuits are directed acyclic graphs of operands +(sum),*(product) as internal circuit elements (gates) and variable or numeric constant inputs as leaves. There is one output gate at root. Arithmetic circuits formalize computation of polynomials over a coefficient field. Some prominent upper bound (Big-O) results in arithmetic complexity include Matrix Multiplication and lower bound (Omega) results include size of arithmetic cicruit computing exponential polynomials. It has to be noted that solving Diophantine equations and computing polynomials are two opposite inverse directions - solving diophantines involves searching for a solution space while computing polynomials is circuit value problem and involves substituting solution values in arithmetic circuit input variables and evaluating the root gate. Algebraic Complexity classes VP and VNP define the arithmetic hierarchy of polynomials - VP contains polynomials which have polynomial size arithmetic circuits while VNP has polynomials such that coefficient of every monomial in it can be found efficiently. Permanent of a matrix has been shown to be complete for the class VNP by [Valiant]. If Permanent has polynomial size circuits, VP=VNP. From MRDP theorem, every recursively enumerable set is known to have a diophantine equation representation. There exists a universal diophantine equation which represents every recursively enumerable set ([Jones] theorem). Present state-of-the-art is universal diophantine of 9 unknowns of huge degree 1.6 * 10^45. It is open if Diophantine complexity class D ([Adleman-Manders]) is in NP (or D in VNP in algebraic complexity because P in NP implies VP in VNP?). Complementary Sets (Beatty Sequences) and their relevance to ABC Conjecture have been described earlier. By universal diophantine equation of 9 unknowns but huge degree, every subset of quality 1+epsilon for every real epsilon > 0 predicted by ABC conjecture can be represented. Complexity of a Diophantine Equation is also expressed by proof complexity notion of number of additions, multiplications required for verifying a solution. For universal diophantine equation, current known proof complexity bound is 100.

Number of unknowns in diophantine equals number of variables of 3SAT. This reduction implies diophantine class D is in NP. Real solutions to this SAT diophantine (e.g by Tarski method) is another kind of relaxation similar to least squares approximate MAXSAT Solver. But an added advantage is there exists a universal diophantine equation in 9 unknowns for any 3SAT diophantine though number of variables in 3SAT could be unlimited.

624. (THEORY) Shell Turing Machines, MRDP Theorem, Category Theory, Diophantine Equations, Turing Degrees, Embedding Formal Languages in Vector Space - 10 December 2018, 21 August 2019 - related to 538
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Intuition for Shell Turing Machines defined in https://5d99cf42-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/kuja27/UndecidabilityOfFewNonTrivialQuestions.pdf has been explained in NeuronRain FAQ https://neuronrain-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ . Dimension of a Shell Turing Machine parallels Turing Degree of a Turing Machine which is a measure of unsolvability of a set. Every Shell Turing Machine is defined on a vector space and all Shell Turing machines of similar dimension create an equivalence class. Partial Order Semi-Lattice is induced by this vector space dimensional hierarchy of Shell Turing Machines. Following example Shell Turing Machines defined over two different vector spaces of dimensions d1 and d2 motivate solvability hierarchy:

Turing Machines Td1 and Td2 find the lexicographically longest tuple (word) in languages L(Td1) and L(Td2). Tuples in L(Td1) and L(Td2) are of the form [x1,x2,x3,...,xd1] and [x1,x2,x3,...,xd2] respectively. Though both Td1 and Td2 are computationally similar, words in L(Td1) and L(Td2) belong to two different vector spaces of dimensions d1 and d2 therefore returning different results of lengths d1 and d2. This implies Turing degrees of Td1 and Td2 are different and the two machines solve varied difficulties.

In this sense, Shell Turing Machines generalize the notion of word embeddings of natural languages (e.g Word2Vec) in a vector space to any formal language - Regular, Context-Free, Context-Sensitive or Natural, Recursive, Recursively Enumerable - and formal languages become algebraic sets (similarity to VP and VNP is intriguing). MRDP Theorem implies Goedel's First Incompleteness Theorem. MRDP Theorem implies there are recursively enumerable sets having Diophantine representation but not recursive (there are no halting accept/reject Turing machines and therefore H10 is undecidable for set of integers). For Shell Turing Machines, MRDP theorem applies too but there is an additional fine structure (Dimension hieararchy partial order) introduced by vector space dimensions similar to Turing Degrees. Another relevant question arises: How Shell Turing Machines map to Diophantine representations i.e What is the relation between (number of unknowns, degree) of a diophantine equation of an RE set to the vector space dimension of Shell Turing Machine accepting it.

Example embedding of natural language text sentence in a Shell Turing Machine defined over vector space:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sentence: "This is bigger than the biggest" is an oxymoron if read flat with no dimensional depth. Assuming
there exists set of Shell Turing Machines defined on a vector space of dimension d+x having oracle access to
Shell Turing Machine defined on a vector space of dimension d (Turing Jump), following dimension subscripted sentence is an example sentence in a Shell Turing Machine of dimension d+x having oracle access to lower dimensional (d) Shell Turing Machine and transcends two vector spaces of varied dimensions:
	This (d+x) is bigger (d+x) than the biggest(d)
Vector Space for a Shell Turing Machine can be any arbitrary topological space in real analysis e.g Baire Space, Cantor Space (sets homeomorphic to Cantor Set Fractal obtained by removing midsegment of a line indefinitely)

Set of Recursively Enumerable Languages can be written as disjoint union/exact cover of recursively enumerable languages of Shell Turing Machines embedded in vector spaces of all possible dimensions:
	RE = RE(d1) U RE(d2) U RE(d3) ... U RE(dn)
Since each dimension corresponds to a Turing Degree (measure of unsolvability), Partial Order Semi Lattice of all Shell Turing Machines has a Lowest Upper Bound dimension - There exists a maximal dimension Turing Machine dm accepting some RE(dm) language. Shell Turing Machines are most befitting in formalizing Computational Physics problems e.g Quantum and Relativistic Physics, String Theory/M-Theory, Branes, Multiverses.

An adaptation of Halting Problem to Shell Turing Machines
----------------------------------------------------------
Undecidability of Halting Problem is proved by following gadget (oversimplified):
Turing Machine M' accepts an encoding of another Turing Machine M and an input x - M'(M,x). 
		M' rejects and halts if M accepts and halts on x
		M' accepts and halts if M rejects and halts on x
Turing Machine M'' accepts if M' rejects and rejects if M' accepts which detects M has halted either way - M''(M'(M,x))

Contradiction is established by changing the Turing machine encoding to M' from M as M'(M',x):
		M' rejects and halts if M' accepts and halts on x
		M' accepts and halts if M' rejects and halts on x
which is crucial to undecidability of halting. Previous encoding has no dimensional information. If M' and M are
Shell Turing Machines of varied dimensions d1 and d2, Halting Problem is rephrased as - M''(M'[d1](M[d2],x[d2])) - Turing Machine M' defined in space of dimension d1 accepts encoding of Turing Machine M and an input x defined in space of dimension d2 (d1 > d2)

Following diagonalization proof of halting problem undecidability extends to Shell Turing Machines:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let f(x,i) be a function defined as:
	f(x,i) = 1 if Turing Machine x halts on input i, 0 if Turing Machine x does not halt on input i.
Let g(y) be another function defined as:
	g(y) = 0 if f(y,y)=0, else undefined (if f(y,y)=1)

Diagonalization is an infinite two dimensional matrix D defined as:
	D(x,y)  = 1 if Turing Machine x halts on input y, 0  if Turing Machine x does not halt on y
Proof is by showing function f(x,i) is partial and not total (not defined for all inputs) and thus not recursive but recursively enumerable.

Nothing prevents asking what is g(g):
	g(g) = if f(g,g)=0 then 0, else undefined (if f(g,g) = 1)

=> f(g,g) = 1 if Machine g halts on encoding of g, 0 if Machine g does not halt on encoding of g (Diagonal of the Diagonalization Matrix D)

But from previous definition of g(g):
	g(g) = if f(g,g)=0 (if Machine g does not halt on g) then g(g) halts returning 0 and
		if f(g,g)=1 (if Machine g halts on g) then g(g) is undefined
which is a contradiction.

The fact that there exists atleast one Turing Machine g whose halting is not decidable makes f(x,i) partial and not a total recursive function and therefore Halting problem is undecidable. It has to be noted that function g has oracle access to Halting problem function f(x,i) thus defining a Turing jump (0'). But Recursively Enumerable set has been previously expressed as disjoint union of languages of Shell Turing Machines defined on all possible vector spaces. This implies there are Shell Turing Machines which are not recursive (but represented by a Diophantine equation). Implications of this for problems in Quantum computation and Relativistic Physics defined for example on Hilbert Spaces are huge - There are Shell Turing Machines defined on certain vector spaces which are not recursive (or) there are no physics experiments for verifying truths of physical realities represented by these Hilbert Machines. 

Problem of relevance to Shell Turing Machines is: What happens to halting problem if functions f and g are defined on two different vector spaces of unequal dimensions. If f(x,i) is embedded on a Hilbert space S1 which contains all other vector spaces and g(y) on another Hilbert space S2 (S1 contains S2), truth value of a logical statement in two quantifiers:

For all Shell Turing Machines x defined in Hilbert space S(d) of dimension d, there exists input i defined in S(d) such that x halts on i (True or False)

has to be exported to f(x,i) defined on Hilbert space S1 containing S(d)

This lifting/export of logical statements between Hilbert Spaces of 2 different dimensions is accomplished by Linear Transformations between Hilbert Spaces. Section 4.2 of Reference 624.5 describes some example definitions of logical formulas (conjunctive normal form) in Hilbert Spaces. Conjunctive Clauses of the formulas are represented as vectors of a Hilbert Space. It is not necessary that all transformations are possible. Computational Physics example: Assuming logical statements inside a blackhole singularity are defined in some Hilbert Space, existence of all possible linear transformations implies information (truths of logical formulas) oozes out of the blackhole space into observable space (e.g Hawking Radiation, Blackholes are not Black, Blackhole information paradox)

Traditional results on homomorphisms between Vector Spaces apply to Shell Turing Machines defined on any two vector spaces one of which is a subspace of the other: 
	(*) If T is a homomorphism defined from vectorspace U to vectorspace V of kernel W, then V is isomorphic to U/W. Conversely, if U is a vectorspace and W is a subspace of U, then there is a homomorphism of U onto U/W.
	(*) If U is a vectorspace defined over field F, and W is a subspace of V then V/W is a quotient vectorspace over F if for v1, v2 in V and v1 + W in V/W, v2 + W in V/W:
	(v1 + W) + (v2 + W) = (v1+v2) + W
		(and)
	For a in F, a(v1 + W) = av1 + W

If Shell Turing Machines S1(U) and S2(W) are defined over vector spaces V and W and W is subspace of V and there is a homomorphism T(defined by relation "bigger than") from V to V/W, previous example oxymoron sentence - "This is bigger than the biggest" - is logically defined in quotient space V/W in first order logic quantifiers as (annotated by square parentheses]:
	This is [There exists v1 in V] bigger than [T(v1,identity + w1):v1 > identity + w1] the biggest [there exists w1 in W such that for all w in W, w1 > w]

Shell Turing Machines can be defined in terms of Category Theory too:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Category Theory of [Eilenberg-MacLane] abstracts whole of mathematics into following:
	(*) Category C is a Set of Objects associated with a topological space
	(*) Every Category has set of morphisms f:a-b defined on objects a,b in Category C - morphisms are maps between objects on topological spaces - every morphism f:a-b on objects a,b in topological spaces can be a Shell Turing Machine defined on topological spaces of a and b 
	(*) Functors F are maps between two Categories C1 and C2 - for each object x in C1, F(x) is in C2 and for each morphism f:a-b in C1
morphism, F(f):F(a)-F(b) is in C2 - every functor F can be a Shell Turing Machine defined on topological spaces of F(a) and F(b)

to all sections expanding https://tac.nist.gov//publications/2010/participant.papers/CMI_IIT.proceedings.pdf
and https://arxiv.org/abs/1006.4458 and ThoughtNet - 21 December 2018
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Search Engines usually rank results as linear total order. Alternatively for each query ranked set of results
can be a partial order and not necessarily total. This has been mentioned as a passing reference in ArXiv and
NIST TAC articles previously. Traditionally Intrinsic Merit/Fitness is a scalar quantity which can be vectorized
based on feature dimensions. Consequently, two URLs may not be comparable by a total ordering < relation. Following example intrinsic merit vector partial ordered rankings of websites intuit this:

(1) Subset partial ordered ranking - set of subsets ordered by containment:
	[1,2,3,4]
	|	\
	[1,2,3] [2,3,4]
	|	 |
	[1,2]	[2,3]

(2) Less Than or Equal To Ranking - Each tuple has elements of value less than or equal to elements of predecessor tuple:
	[1,2,3,4]	[2,3,2,5]
	|			|
	[1,1,2,3] ----- [2,2,3,4]
	|
	[1,1,1,2]

Search Results for any two different queries thus create two partial ordered tuple sets of rankings. Galois 
connections define maps F and G between elements of two posets A and B subject to conditions:
	a in A, b in B
	F(a)=c in B, G(b)=d in A
	F(a) <= b if and only if a <= G(b)
Previous Galois Connections provide an alternative spectacle to perceive ThoughtNet - ThoughtNet as defined
elsewhere earlier is a hypergraph of sentence hyperedges on evocative hypervertices motivated by Psycho-and-Neurolinguistics. Search engine queries can be construed as evocatives returning results evoked by the query
and thus search engine results are hyperedges of a ThoughtNet (Internet itself as a ThoughtNet) and queries are evocative hypervertices - same search result URL can appear in more than two queries creating the hyperedge across these query hypervertices.Previous partial ordered rankings of search results bring an additional application of Galois connections amongst search result posets - if URLs a,b,c,d are such that a=c and b=d aforementioned Galois connections are equivalent to hyperedges between ranked search query result posets in ThoughtNet and evocative hypervertices are search queries => ThoughtNet is a giant transitive Galois Connection which is different from Contextual Multi Armed Bandit formulation of ThoughtNet earlier. Various results and theorems applicable to ThoughtNet Hypergraphs (and its stripped down version of Survival Index Timeout pattern) have been mentioned in:

2. One time Likelyhood Dictionary computation of prefixes,suffixes and substrings has been shifted to WordSubstringProbabilities.py - wordlikelydict() and wordprefixsuffixsubstringsprobdist()
3. All precomputed prefix and suffix priors are initialized in TextCompression.py __init__()
4. Costly loop in HiddenMarkovModel_MLE() of TextCompression.py has been done away with and instead wordlikelydict() has been changed to choose between costly exhaustive search and substringsdict list comprehension.
5. Hardcoded priors for HMM have been removed and replaced by previous likelihood computation.
6. Logs for this have been committed to testlogs/TextCompression.log.3January2019
7. likelydict is created on demand once per compressed word than earlier heavy initialization for all possible likelihoods.
8. Regular Expressions are used in list comprehension for matching strings - "_" are treated as alphabets in lower or upper case.
9. For Exhaustive Search. following line is crucial which computes the conditional probability of a prefix for a suffix:
		likelydict[k3[:-1]+k3[len(k3)-1]+k4[1:]] = v3 * v4
10. The else clause, generalizes it and applies precomputed frequency probabilities of concatenated substrings circumventing the following conditional probability:
		likelydict[substring1 + substring2 + ... + substringN] = Pr(substring1) * Pr(substring2) * ... * Pr(substringN)
by:
		likelydict[substring1 + substring2 + ... + substringN] = Pr(substring1 + substring2 + ... + substringN)
11. Both should be almost equal if substring random variables are independent and identically distributed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As mentioned in previous sections, finding Diophantine representation of a complementary set reduces to creating a map f from diophantine set a={a1,a2,...,an} such that f(x,b)=0 for unknown x in {Integers/Reals/Rationals/Complex} and parameter b in a. Discussions previously have been mostly restricted to Integers, Reals and Rationals and terminology "complement function" is applied to a diophantine of integer solutions to x and is totally defined for all x(recursive) throughout all sections of this draft. Extension to Complex Diophantine Sets involves applying a converse of Thue's Equation which exactly solves a known homogenous bivariate diophantine f:
	f(x,y)=m, m is non-zero integer.
f(x,y) is factorized as:
	f(x,y)=a(d)*product_r=1_to_d(x-alpha(r)*y)
where alpha(r) are complex roots of f(t,1)=a0+a1*t+a2*t^2+...a(d)*t^d=0.

But f is assumed to be unknown for a complementary diophantine set and has to be represented by reversing the factorization to an interpolation:
	f(x,y)=a(d)*product_r=1_to_d(x-alpha(r)*y)
for all alpha(r) in a complex complementary diophantine set CDS={alpha1,alpha2,...,alphad} which yields f(x,y) for integer values of x,y. Assumption here is CDS is the set of complex roots of f(t,1)=a0+a1*t+a2*t^2+...a(d)*t^d=0.

Siegel Equation generalizes Thue's Theorem for arbitrary diphantine equations in integer coeffients. f(x,y) is decomposed as:
	f(x,y) = h(x,y) + k(x,y) 
where h(x,y) is homogenous and Thue's equation applies. Set of complex solutions of f(x,y) adjoined by set of distinct {alpha(r)} form a Riemann compact surface of singularities or an algebraic curve which is the required Complement Diophantine Surface over Complex Numbers. Mordell-Weil Theorem is a classic result which states diophantine elliptic curves of the form:
	y^2 = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c
have finitely many rational solutions which can be obtained by a chord-tangent algorithm and create an abelian group. Elliptic curve diophantines of finite rational solutions are suitable candidates for formalizing finite sets of triples in complement diophantine version of ABC conjecture mentioned in 617 - "...Q1 is the 3 dimensional half-space of Cube tiled by finite sets of triples of quality 1+epsilon for every real epsilon. As mentioned earlier, Pentominoes tiling is an exact cover problem for 2 dimensions...".

Algebraic or Arithmetic circuits for Diophantines over Complex Numbers can be defined by complexity classes over complex numbers (classes Pc, Npc,...). Blum-Shub-Smale Turing Machine model generalizes Turing Machines over Z[2] to any Field Real,Complex,Rationals etc.,For example, Hilbert Nullstellensatz problem decides if set of polynomials have common root and is in algebraic complexity class HNc over complex numbers. Riemann Zeta Function can be represented as a disjunctive clauses or non-uniform Hilbert Nullstellensatz algebraic circuit in 0-1-HNc (0 if s is a non-trivial zero else 1) of product polynomials having complex roots (non-trivial zeros): 
	RZF=product_of(1/[1-prime(k)^(-s)]) for all primes 2,3,5,7,...
Algebraic computation is defined by a binary tree - Algebraic Computation Tree over +,-.%,*,sqrt().From Koiran's Theorem 0-1-NPc (variables are binary but polynomial size certificates are complex) is in AM[2]=BP.NP if Riemann Hypothesis is True which equates conventional complexity classes over Z[2] and algebraic classes. 0-1-HNc is 0-1-NPc-complete and 0-1-HNc is in PSPACE. This is an alternative circuit formulation to Euler-Fourier polynomial mentioned in 24 for Riemann Zeta Function. Number of solutions (non-trivial zeros) to previous RZF circuit can be characterized by counting class equivalent Sharp-0-1-HNc (not in literature). From Riemann Hypothesis, all these solutions must have Re(s) = 0.5.

Riemann Hypothesis can be written as an infinite Disjunctive Normal Form SAT in Blum-Shub-Smale Turing Machine model and by Hilbert Nullstellensatz finding non-trivial zeros of Riemann Hypothesis is 0-1-HNc and thus 0-1-NPc-complete (if infinite version of Nullstellensatz is 0-1-NPc-complete). Diophantine representation of RZF in 471.22 implies Riemann Hypothesis is in Diophantine class D which is subset of NP (for Turing machines over reals):
	RZF=product_of(1/[1-prime(k)^(-s)]) for all primes k=2,3,5,7,...
	=> Each of the prime monomial having 1 as coefficient in infinite product can be written in Hilbert Nullstellensatz form as:
	product_of(1 - k^-s) = \/ (1 - xk), xk = 1/k^s
	=> k^s = k^(a+ib) = k^a*k^ib = k^a * (e^[ib * logk])
	=> k^a (cos(blogk) + isin(blogk))
	=> k^-s = k^-a (cos(blogk) - isin(blogk))
	=> RZFSAT = \/(1 - k^-s) = \/(1-k^-a*cos(blogk)+k^-a*isin(blogk)) and a=0.5 if Riemann Hypothesis is true.
Proving Riemann Hypothesis is equivalent to proving all satisfying assignments (nontrivial zeros -infinite of them) for RZFSAT earlier have a=0.5. Instead of considering infinite product earlier, finite number of monomials per prime could be multiplied i.e iteratively add prime monomial clauses to RZFSAT for each consecutive prime and find s=a+ib from assignment xk=p+iq by equating:
	p = k^-a*cos(blogk)
	q = -k^-a*sin(blogk) 
	tan^-1(-p/q)/logk = b
	log[cos(tan^-1(-p/q)logk)/p]/logk = a
	
Compute infinite series of values of a for every clause of consecutive prime monomial incrementally added to RZFSAT ad infinitum:
	a1,a2,a3,....
Previous infinite series should converge to 0.5 if Riemann Hypothesis is true which can be verified by series convergence tests. For finite RZFSAT this series may or may not converge to 0.5.

Every term in Euler product version of RZF earlier could be written as complex power of corresponding prime by following transform:
	p^s/(p^s - 1) = p^k
	(or) log[p^s/(p^s - 1)] = k*log(p)
	=> k = 1/log(p) * {log[p^s/(p^s - 1)]}
Consequently, RZF could be written as infinite multiplicative partition of complex exponents for all primes solvable by an algebraic computation tree on Blum-Shub-Smale Turing machines over Complex field - non-trivial zeros of RZF input to non-uniform algebraic computation tree should asymptotically evaluate to 0. Usual multiplicative partition(factorisatio numerorum) is limited to integral powers:
	RZF = p1^c1 * p2^c2 * p3^c3 ... ad infinitum, cn = 1/log(pn) * {log[pn^s/(pn^s - 1)]} for pn = 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,... 
Earlier multiplicative partition version of RZF could be further reduced to factorization product of two polynomials over complex field - one finite and the other infinite - by splitting the infinite product into product of two factor polynomials. Extended RZF written in terms of Gamma function requires zero-knowledge of primes.

1. Implementations in NeuronRain on Intrinsic Merit Versus Fame previously have so far concentrated only on Merit of Text (TextGraphs), Large Scale Visuals (Videos and Images - LSVR) and People (Interview/Examination/Contest based merit, Analytics of Social Network Profile Vertices). Merit of Audio or Complexity of Music has been defined theoretically earlier as a minimum size DFA or Turing Machine accepting musical notes as language which is a minimum description length measure similar to Kolmogorov complexity.
2.To this effect music_pattern_mining/AudioToBitMatrix.py has been changed to include a new function which converts an audio waveform to frequency domain by FFT. These frequencies are in turn mapped to a string of musical notes over octave alphabet - C,D,E,F,G,A,B,C (12 including fine divisions of notes denoted by #) - librosa API are invoked.
3.Essentially by mapping music to huge strings over octave alphabets the problem of music mining is made easier and all algorithms implemented for string mining in NeuronRain apply to music as well.
4.Since music is often related to creative genius, complexity of string of notes is an approximation of merit.
5.String of musical notes differ from usual text strings because of an inherent periodicity in music (self-similar fractal-like ascending and descending sequence of notes)
6.logs for an example audio to notes string has been committed to python-src/music_pattern_mining/testlogs/AudioToBitMatrix.log.AudioToNotes.12January2019
7.State machine diagrams for Minimum Turing Machine or DFA accepting languages of strings of octave notes
are directed graphs possibly having lots of cycles implying inherent periodicity in music. All directed graph complexity measures and algorithms therefore could quantify merit of audio or music.
8.Emphasis is laid more on music patterns than audio patterns because audio is simply some textual content extractable by speech recognition and spelt out in flat notes of similar frequency mostly without modulation excluding emotives.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pythagorean triples are integers of the form a^2 + b^2 = c^2 which can be factorized into product of
Gaussian Integers (Z[i]) as c = (a+ib)(a-ib) which is a hyperbolic curve defined on complex number field (C^2). This extends integer factorization to complex Gaussian Integers factorization of Pythagorean triples. Blum-Shub-Smale Turing Machines can factorize Pythagoren triples to Gaussian Integers. Ray Shooting Query Algorithms so far described previously depend on rays from origin (0,0) and piercing hyperbolic arc bow at different spacings. Instead of ray shooting from origin (0,0), end points of the hyperbolic arc can be connected by a chord (line between (0,N) and (N,0)) and midpoint of this chord is an alternative origin for ray shooting queries. This inverts the sweepline direction of rays from (0,0) to (N,N) to (N,N) to (0,0). 

From QNC Computational Geometric Factorization described earlier, hyperbolic pixelated arc bow can be specified as a Hilbert Space vector superposition of factor/product states (ket notation) over complex amplitudes Bi:
	|(p,q)> = B1|(x1,y1)> + B2|(x2,y2)> + ... + Bn|(xO(N),yO(N))>
and Bi^2 is the classical probability of a state |(xi,yi)>. QNC contains polynomial size quantum multiplication logdepth toffoli gates while NC has polynomial size logdepth PRAM processors and containment NC in QNC in BQP is known. Quoting reference 562.10 - "...If the HHL algorithm could be adapted to the case where (say) a single bi is 1 and all the others are 0, then it would contradict the impossibility of an exponential speedup for black-box quantum search, which was proved by Bennett, Bernstein, Brassard, and Vazirani...", if classical probability Bi^2 of some state |(xi,yi)> is 1:
		Bi^2 = (a+ib)^2 = (a^2 - b^2) + i(2ab) = 1
		implying b=0 and |a| = 1
Zero imaginary part in previous sceanario implies a possibility of decoherence from quantum toffoli gates in QNC to PRAMs in NC. No cloning theorem implies quantum state cannot be replicated. But since NC is contained in QNC, every PRAM algorithm in NC can be translated to a quantum algorithm in QNC. For example any two toffoli multiplication gates in QNC algorithm for two PRAMs in NC algorithm (e.g for previous factorization problem allowing decoherence), must have different state superposition vectors v1 and v2 such that v1 has some factor state amplitude Bi(v1) and v2 has other factor state amplitude Bk(v2) of classical probabilities 1: Bi(v1)^2 = Bk(v2)^2 = 1 which does not violate No cloning theorem.

Even if classical probability Bi^2 of some factor state Bi=|(xi,yi)> is not 1 but close to 1 in previous superposition of factor/product states, implying amplitudes of other factor states are non-zero, QNC factorization collapses to a classical BPNC factorization (e.g. a randomized PRAM factorization algorithm) despite no derandomization to NC. Derandomizing BPNC to NC has been mentioned previously in references 53.12.1 and 53.12.4 (Hitting Set Generators) which does not rule out possibility of a complete collapse of QNC all the way upto NC via BPNC.

1.DeepLearning_SchedulerAnalytics.py and DeepLearning_SoftwareAnalytics.py have been updated for
correction to a serious bug in BackPropagation computation.
2.Earlier, BackPropagation Neural Network (BPNN) object for Software and Scheduler Analytics was getting created for every input training dataset element erroneously.
3.This has been remedied by instantiating BackPropagation class only once outside the loop and updating only the input layer and/or expected output layer for each element in input dataset iteration.
4.Iterations have been curtailed for concise logs.
5.By this change, weights are updated for every psutil per process proc object (Scheduler Analytics) or systemwide process statistics info (Software Analytics) thus learning weights of the multilayer perceptron from system performance.
6.logs for this have been committed to testlogs/DeepLearning_SchedulerAnalytics.log.9February2019 and testlogs/DeepLearning_SoftwareAnalytics.log.9January2019 (Timestamped wrongly - must be read DeepLearning_SoftwareAnalytics.log.9February2019)
7.After sufficiently large number of input training data, hopefully this BPNN would be able to predict outputs from input per-process and systemwide performance statistics data e.g 99% load average.

number of text graph - related to 2,617,630,632 and all sections on Fame and Merit - 11 February 2019
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.It has been mentioned earlier that texts which are concatenations of words can be represented by
*) Matrix Diophantine Equations *) and (255 or 511) coloring of texts by ASCII/Unicode alphabets (excluding space) which give rise to ramsey ordering by Van Der Waerden Theorem assuming texts of size N are integer sequences of locations 1-to-N colored by alphabets containing monochromatic arithmetic progressions of alphabet(color) locations.
2.Best known upper bound for Van Der Waerden Number for a least length sequence of N integers = W(r,k) for r-coloring of an integer sequence and arithmetic progression of least length k <= 2^2^(r^2^2^(k+9)) by [Timothy Gowers]
3.Previous upperbound for texts colored by alphabets of size 255 implies size N of a natural language text to have length k arithmetic progressions on alphabet locations <= 2^2^(255^2^2^(k+9)) which is huge even for small k.
4.Ramsey coloring R(r,s) of graphs is equivalent of Van Der Waerden sequence coloring which defines emergence of monochromatic cliques r or independent sets s (also known as Friends and Strangers theorem).
5.By definition of complementation in generic sense, k-coloring partitions a set into k disjoint subsets which can be represented by some diophantine (e.g Beatty functions) - Complementation is a size 2 partition.
5.In this commit, Ramsey R2 function is invoked from NetworkX API on textgraphs of natural language texts and maxclique-maxindependentset pairs are computed.
7.This is a less intensive intrinsic merit measure for a text and Van Der Waerden number computation has no mention in python libraries presently and is daunting too - SAT solvers are used to compute Van Der Waerden Numbers in some algorithms.
8.Following this reasoning, strings of octave alphabets in music can be construed as 12-coloring (and more including majors and minors) of music as sequence and indicates inevitable emergence of order from chaos.

(THEORY) Computational Geometric Factorization - Parallel Planar Point Location of factors in Monotone Subdivision formed by Hyperbolic Arc Pixel Polygons with no necessity for Ray Shooting Queries, Van Der Waerden Ramsey Coloring of Sequences, Computational Algebraic Geometry - related to 506,601,605 and other sections on factorization - 12 February 2019, 18 February 2019, 20 February 2019, 22 September 2019, 20 October 2020
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In previous sections on computational geometric factorization, various parallel algorithms based on k-mergesort,segment tree, wavelet tree,sorting networks,planar point location and ray shooting were described to locate factors on the hyperbolic arc tile segments (or) pixel array polygons. A continuous hyperbolic curve is "rectified" to a chain of non-intersecting polygons (juxtaposed) by considering each tile segment (x, N/x, x+1, N/x) of hyperbola obtained by differential calculus identity delta=N/[x(x+1)] as a rectangular polygon of dimension 1 * N/[x(x+1)] which is an array of pixels of dimension 1 * 1 containing the product of x and y ordinates in arithmetic progression and thus implicitly sorted. These adjoining rectangular polygons which meet at endpoints, create a plain simple line graph formed by their vertices and edges which is strongly connected. This set of polygons partition the 2 dimensional plane of area (1,N)*(1,N) into 3 planar subdivisions - space above hyperbolic polygons, space within the hyperbolic polygons and space below hyperbolic polygons. Earlier algorithms assumed arbitrary subdivisions and had ray shooting to find a polygon containing approximate factor as a prerequisite which is then binary searched. But this chain of hyperbolic tile polygons is monotone because y-axis is strictly decreasing or non-increasing for any path along the plain simple line graph (PSLG) formed by hyperbolic polygonal planar subdivision. There are efficient algorithms for PRAM geometric searching of monotone subdivisions mentioned in references below. Thus locating a hyperbolic pixel array polygon containing factor point can be done in O(logN) PRAM time and finding the factor in this polygon by sequential binary search in additional O(logN) sequential time. Thus factorization by planar point location in monotone subdivision of hyperbolic pixel array polygons is in O(logN) parallel + O(logN) sequential time - and thus in Nick's class - without requirement of approximate factoring by ray shooting queries.

Arithmetic Progression of points as product of ordinates within each Hyperbolic pixel array polygon brings Ramsey/Van Der Waerden coloring of sequences into the realm of factorization - by k-mergesort the tile segement polygons are unified into single totally ordered integer sequence of length N*N/(N+1). If each arithmetic progression polygon is colored uniquely, the sorted sequence is a union of set of k-colored arithmetic progressions of some minimum length (or) N*N/(N+1) = VanDerWaerden(k, minimum length of a segment)

In all sections related to factorization in this draft, factoring only one integer at a time has been the focus. Geometric intuition of hyperbolic tile/polygon segmentation allows storing segments or polygons for hyperbolic curves of multiple integers in same datastructure which could be segment tree, wavelet tree, or point location tree. For example two rectified hyperbolic polygons/segments for xy=N1 and xy=N2 for factoring N1 and N2 can be stored in single search tree which can be queried for factor points of N1 and N2 independently. This optimization saves lot of parallel tree construction time and space.

636.8 List of Problems in NC and Drawbacks of NC Theory - http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~tvrdik/3/html/Section3.html - Parallel sorting and most of Computational Geometric Problems are in NC - "...The class NC may include some algorithms which are not efficiently parallelizable. The most infamous example is parallel binary search...NC theory assumes situations where a huge machine (polynomial number of processors, e.g., millions) solves very quickly (polylogarithmic time, e.g., seconds) moderately sized problems (e.g., hundred of thousands input items). In practice, however, moderately sized machines (hundreds, at most thousands of processors) are used to solve large problems (e.g., millions of input items). So that the number of processors tends to be subpolynomial, even sublinear...." - This practical limitation of NC applies to computational geometric factorization by planar point location especially when huge integers e.g semiprimes of the order of 1024 bits or more in public key infrastructure have to be factorized. This requires huge number of processors (PRAMs) but yet theoretically highly parallelly feasible. Precision ray shooting queries optimization like tile-summation ray shooting sieves out lot of factorless segments of hyperbolic arc bow finding approximate factors which are in proximity to exact factors and with high probability in same polygon/segment facilitating binary search of arithmetic progression.If a ray shooting query followed by binary search fails to find exact factor, angle of the ray can be altered in either direction and shot again covering unswept areas of the plane. Ray shooting partitions the hyperbolic arc into O(N/loglogN) segments for O(loglogN) prime factor ray queries.

By analytic number theory every tile segment arithmetic progression an + b can be written as a generating function z^b/(1 - z^a). It is natural to ask if union of tile segment arithmetic progressions can be written as single generating function. Answer is no by contradiction. Generating functions based arithmetic progression exact cover of set of natural numbers is a special case of complement diophantines and complementary equations - "...Thus the dissection into evens and odds corresponds to the identity ∞ n0 z^n = ∞ n0 z^2n + ∞ n0 z*2n+1, and the dissection into 2n, 4n + 1, 4n + 3 corresponds to ∞ n0 z^n = ∞ n0 z^2n + ∞  n0 z*4n+1 +∞ n0 z*4n+3, ...."

Each of N/(logN)^k PRAM processors binary searches (logN)^k segments allocated to it in (logN)^k * logN = (logN)^(k+1) parallel time.

Each edge of this isotopic graph could be independently and parallely rasterized by Bresenham line rasterization to obtain set of pixel array polygons which could be located for factor points in polylog time.
636.18 On the Sorting of Points along an algebraic curve - [Johnstone-Bajaj] - Convex segment decomposition - https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1702&context=cstech - "... Given a segment AB of an algebraic curve, a set of points on the curve is sorted from A to B along AB by putting them into the order that they would be encountered in traveling continuously from A to B along AB. ...". Parallel planar point location factorization in its earlier version required global sorting of set of segments (arithmetic progressions of ordinate products) of hyperbolic arc within an interval to facilitate binary search of factor points. Local binary search obviates global sorting by assigning O((logN)^k) implicitly sorted segments each to O(N/(logN)^k) processors in parallel for sequential binary searching them which is of PRAM time O((logN)^(k+1)).

638.(FEATURE) Software Analytics - Scheduler Analytics - /etc/sysctl.conf kernel.sched_* optional
clause - 25 February 2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.DeepLearning_SchedulerAnalytics.py has been changed to include new clause for writing sysctl.conf kernel.sched_* variables instead of scheduler classes within learnt_scheduler_class() based on output layer of BackPropagation Neural Network(BPNN)
2.These variables are documented in:
	2.1 https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/scheduler/
	2.2 https://doc.opensuse.org/documentation/leap/tuning/html/book.sle.tuning/cha.tuning.taskscheduler.html
3.Different values of kernel.sched_* are returned based on numpy mean of output layer of BPNN. For example:
["kernel.sched_latency_ns=9000000",
 "kernel.sched_migration_cost_ns=100000",
 "kernel.sched_wakeup_granularity_ns=2000000",
 "kernel.rr_timeslice_ms=10",
 "sched_rt_runtime_us=990000",
 "sched_nr_migrate=12",
 "sched_time_avg_ms=100"]
which increase CPU affinity of a process, its timeslice quantum and reduce cost of CPU loadbalancing and migration if it is CPU-intensive.

639.(FEATURE) Software Analytics - Scheduler Analytics - /proc/sched_debug support - 27 February 2019
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Missing kernel prefix for some of the /etc/sysctl.conf variables have been included in return array.
2./proc/sched_debug support has been included by defining a new function to read /proc/sched_debug and
print the red-black tree of the Complete Fair Scheduler (CFS) [https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.2/source/kernel/sched_fair.c] runqueue for user defined iterations in a loop - reads the /proc/sched_debug periodically, reverses the list of lines to print the tail.
3./proc/sched_debug is a convenient alternative to BCC tools runqlat
4.Kernel CFS chooses the root of the red-black tree which has least virtual runtime to schedule it to run on CPU thereby prioritizing and fairly treating starved processes.
5.Tree Key field is the virtual runtime of the process id - Example below prints runqueue at any instant for a CPU:

runnable tasks:
            task   PID         tree-key  switches  prio     exec-runtime         sum-exec        sum-sleep

640.(FEATUE) Software Analytics - Streaming Analytics + Scheduler Analytics - /proc/sched_debug -
28 February 2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.DeepLearning_SchedulerAnalytics.py - sched_debug_runqueue() has been changed to return a dictionary
of process runqueue and loop has been removed
2.Streaming Analytics support has been provided for Operating System performance statistics (e.g runqueue) by adding new data_storage "OperatingSystem" and data_source "SchedulerRunQueue" to Streaming_AbstractGenerator.py
3.New clause for previous Scheduler Analytics streaming has been added in __iter__() which invokes
sched_debug_runqueue() in a loop and yields the scheduler runqueue dictionaries.
4.This integrates Streaming and Software Analytics seamlessly and any Streaming or other machine learning algorithm can process Operating System Stats Dictionary Stream like a bigdata source. 
5.DeepLearning_SchedulerAnalytics.py imports this Streaming Abstract Generator by "OperatingSystem" and "SchedulerRunQueue" parameters and reads the scheduler stats as input stream.
6.In future, any operating system data source other than scheduler runqueue can be plugged into Streaming Abstract Generator iterable and fulfils the foremost requirement for real time software streaming analytics.

641.(THEORY) Word Diophantine Equations, Intrinsic Merit defined by Word Equations - 4 March 2019 -
related to 635 and all sections on Merit and Complement Diophantines
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Throughout this draft intrinsic merit of text has been analyzed by results from algorithmic graph theory and dense subgraph complexity measures. Renowned Word Problem in computability encodes every word from an alphabet into an equation. In the context of World Wide Web, Concatenations of words form a text. This leads to concatenation representation of word equations of text by Diophantines. This kind of word equation representation is not just limited to text but to other genre of merits - audio/music, video, social profiles of people encoded as words over binary alphabet - as well. Thus Diophantine representation unifies all 4 classes of merit - text, audio/music, video, people - into one thereby facilitating number theoretic analysis of merit drastically different from graph theoretic perspective earlier:
	(*) Text - Text Graphs -> Text Word Equation Diophantines
	(*) Video - EventNet Tensor Products -> Binary encoded Video Word Equation Diophantines
	(*) Audio/Music - DFA Learning -> Binary encoded Audio/Music Word Equation Diophantines
	(*) People - Mistake Bound Experiential Learning Merit and Social Profile Analytics -> Binary encoded social profile Word Equation Diophantines

Decidability of Hilbert's Tenth Problem is still open for solutions to Word Diophantine Equations. Diophantine Word Equations can enforce arbitrary number of conditions on the solutions e.g length of words.Solutions to a Word Diophantine Equation - text, audio/music, video, people - are kind of unsupervised classifiers which cluster similar texts, audio/music, video and people. For example, Complement Word Equation Diophantines bifurcate the set of texts, audio/music, video and people.

645. (THEORY) Comparing Partitions - Related to 620 and all sections on Majority Voting, Theoretical EVMs, Separate Chaining Hashtable/LSH Set Partitions, Integer Partitions, Complementary Sets and Diophantines, Streaming Histogram/Dictionary Analytics, People Analytics, Software Analytics, Business Analytics - 15 March 2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Previous sections deeply delve into the ubiquitous isomorphism between integer/set partitions and set partitions, particularly those induced by hash table separate chaining buckets. A Theoretical EVM has been formulated having separate chaining partition as basis which is an encrypted set partition of electorate into candidate buckets. Drawing analytic inferences from stream of set partitions has been hitherto a far less researched bigdata topic and applies to whole gamut of theory and analytics - For example:
	(*) Business Analytics - Customer base intelligence is often represented as dynamic stream of histogram set partitions or probability distributions of product influences. Hashtable separate chaining can be picturised as histogram of buckets of hashed items
	(*) People Analytics - Stream of voting patterns in Theoretical EVMs are dynamically changing set partitions of electorate - vote shares in Psephology
	(*) Scheduler Queuing Analytics in Operating Systems - an example hashtable based timeout is described in https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/Grafit/blob/master/course_material/NeuronRain/AdvancedComputerScienceAndMachineLearning/AdvancedComputerScienceAndMachineLearning.txt - finding patterns in stream of scheduler timeout hashtable queues
	(*) Music Spectrograms are streams of Histograms
	(*) Theoretically set partitions are complementary sets or exact cover of a universal set.

Comparing any two set partitions thus far has few standard measures (rooted in comparing two cluster partitions created by supervised or unsupervised classifiers) like Rand Index (RI), Adjusted Rand Index etc., (ARI) which compute distance between partitions as ratio of agreements to disagreements by measuring overlaps. For a stream of set partitions (which could be any of the above), Rand Index or Adjusted Rand Index between two consecutive partitions in the stream themselves create another stream of scalar indices which are easier to interpret. In people analytics or business analytics example above, highly fluctuating stream of rand indices for voting or customer histogram patterns is a measure of disarray in voting and consumers and points to a state of flux whereas a periodic or steady state of stream of rand indices indicates voters and consumers have limited options or are content with status quo. Similarly a chaotic stream of rand indices for Scheduler implies a heavily thrashed system.

Theoretically, rand indices define distance metric between two complementary sets and therefore diophantines (e.g beatty functions for size two partition) defined on them - in other words, diophantines are embedded in a metric space by rand index distance metric (similar to Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space of Functions mentioned in 624.14).

646. (THEORY) Complementary Equations, Spectra of Numbers, Complementary Integer Sequences - related to 645 and all sections on Complement Functions, Complementary Sets and Diophantines - 16 March 2019
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Increasing sequences which partition set of natural integers are known as complementary sequences and equations which define both of them are complementary equations. This definition of complementary equations differs technically from complement functions which are diophantine equation representations of either a set or its complement and not both at once. OEIS sequences b(n)=A005228 and a(n)=A030124 are complementary and both are defined simultaneously by complementary equation b(n) = a(n − 1) + b(n − 1)

Spectra of numbers are integer sequences and defined in terms of rounding off set of real multiples to nearest integers. For example:
	If r is a positive real number, spectra of r = S(r) = { [r],[2r],[3r],...} and [x] is the nearest
integer <= x.

There are some special qualities of Spectra of integers - e.g. Spectra of any three real numbers S[r1],S[r2],S[r3] have some pairs which have infinitely many elements in common and thus cannot be complementary and thus is a prima facie condition for feasibility of complementation.

647. (THEORY and FEATURE) Bounded Error Factorization (Approximate Factors), Ray Shooting Queries, Transition from Quantum to Classical Computation, Derandomization - related to 597,631 - 21 March 2019, 2 August 2019
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Computational Geometric Factorization algorithms described previously, Approximate Factors are found by prime factor estimation involving various number theoretic results which narrow down the location of exact factor to large extent. By searching a circular radius vicinity surrounding an approximate factor, probability of finding a factor is amplified. Error probability of not finding an exact factor by ray queries has been derived previously as:

	N/kloglogN - 2q(logN)^l
	--------------------------
		N/kloglogN

for integer-to-factorize N and constants k,q and l. This error probability though exponential can be brought down to a desired bound by suitable choice of radius and values for constants k,q and l or by precision tile summation ray shooting. Shor's BQP factoring algorithm can be made a PP classical probabilitstic polytime algorithm by [Adleman-DeMarrais-Huang] theorem - BQP in PP. By invocation of Ray Shooting Oracles as subroutines in this PP factoring algorithm, PP is error-bounded to a BPP or BPNC algorithm (by doing ray shooting queries on parallel RAMs). Derandomization of BPP to P has known Hitting Set Generator algorithms. BPNC derandomization has some restrictions - only derandomizing BPNC1 is known. But this could be sufficient because classical PRAM computational geometric factorization is achievable by Parallel Planar Point Location NC1 algorithms of O(logN) parallel time. This pipelined derandomization of BQP through BQP-PP-BPP(or BPNC)-P(or NC) points to prima facie feasibility of wave function superposition collapse (a quantum universal gate) to some classical eigenstate (PRAM).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Knot theoretic formulation of One-Way-Functions (as a Gordion Knot) has been mentioned in https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/Grafit/blob/master/course_material/NeuronRain/AdvancedComputerScienceAndMachineLearning/AdvancedComputerScienceAndMachineLearning.txt. Previous sections describe a hard-to-invert MajorityInverse() function which extracts the identity of the voters who voted for or against a candidate (for simplicity binary 0 or 1). Majority function can be formulated as a knot polynomial by following example procedure:
	(*) Electorate are points on a straightline string 
	(*) Each voter has a decision function or VoterSAT of arbitrary complexity class
	(*) Knot on this string of voters maps each voter to a point on locus of a knot polynomial in
3 dimensional space. This mapping obfuscates the identity of the voter and vouchsafes secrecy.
	(*) Knot polynomial is defined on 3 variable axes - Voters, Candidates, VoterSATs
	(*) Each point on the knot is a tuple (obfuscated_voter_id, obfuscated_VoterSAT, candidate_id) denoting an anonymous vote in ballot
	(*) MajorityInverse() for this Knot ballot is defined as:
		MajorityInverse(obfuscated_voter_id, obfuscated_VoterSAT, candidate_id) = voter_id
	(*) Previous example in 3-dimensions is only for illustrative purposes (Obfuscated VoterSAT in the vote tuple may not be necessary) and knot ballot polynomial can be embedded in arbitrary topological space other than R^3.
	(*) Hardness of previous knot version of MajorityInverse() depends on difficulty in unravelling the knot (to retrieve voter who voted for a candidate) so that secret ballot is not compromised.
	(*) Thus a Gordion Knot Ballot is hard-to-invert MajorityInverse() function.
	(*) Number of votes for a candidate is determined by the number of points on the knot polynomial intersecting the 2-dimensional plane for a candidate axis point.

649. (THEORY) Planar Graph Theoretic Circle Packing, Space Filling/Grid Filling, CSP/Linear Programming, Tile Cover and LSH/Separate Chaining Partitions - related to 135 - 25 March 2019, 1 April 2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Previous algorithms for packing/filling space by circular solids/fluids were based on solving Linear Program and Cellular Automata by a Parallel Pseudorandom Generator. In this section a random graph theoretic circle packing algorithm is described:

Circle Packing problem is defined as filling a grid with non-overlapping circles of maximum possible radii. In other words, sum of radii of the non-overlapping tangential circles are maximized by a constraint satisfaction problem(CSP) or LP. Rectangular grid is mapped to a linear program x11 + x12 + ... + xmn for each ordinate x(ij) of the grid. Points on the grid are randomly filled by a Parallel Pseudorandom Generator and these points are centroids of circles of arbitrary radius which intersect the grid. All grid ordinates intersected by or within the circles are set to 1. Circle Packing Theorem implies this set of tangential circles draw a planar intersection graph or coin graph. Conversely for every planar graph, a set of tangential circles can be demarcated which are solutions to a CSP/LP. This version of circle packing has an added parallel randomness ingredient and therefore is a Parallel Random Graph Circle Packing:
	while (there are unfilled grid ordinates)
	{
		(*) Centroids of tangential circles (which are vertices of random intersection graph) are chosen by a PRG in parallel
		(*) edges are created at random amongst centroid vertices which simulate tangential circles and have length equal to sum of radii of two tangential circles
		(*) any overlap of circles is avoided by shrinking the sum of radii as necessary.
 		(*) all ordinate variables within random tangential circles are set to 1. 
		(*) Grid ordinates are stored in a hashmap and an ordinate is removed from map after being set to 1. 
		(*) At any instant, Parallel PRG choooses only from remaining ordinates in the hashmap which is exhausted when grid is completely filled by circles.
	}

Previous Parallel Random Graph Circle Packing is in BPNC/RNC and indirectly probabilistically solves the constraint satisfaction problem for sum of radii in parallel and is an online algorithm ( whereas sequential CSP/LP solution guarantees that the tangential osculating circles have maximum radius possible apriori).

Circle Packing is also an exact cover set partition of 2-D space (e.g infinite number of circles in Apollonian Gasket). Set partition and space filling (by Circle packing, Tile cover etc.,) have an isomorphism. Separate Chaining Hashtable and LSH partitions are isomorphic to exact tile cover of a rectangular 2-D region and there exists a connection to factorization if Number of elements of a set S is composite and size of every bucket in set partition of S is composite i.e every bucket in histogram is mapped to a rectangular tile in tile cover of S plotted as a rectangle. Size of every bucket can be written as sum of four squares by Lagrange Four Squares Theorem and thus every set in a set partition can be mapped to 4 juxtaposed squares which reduces Balls-Bins/Set partition problems to Tile Packing.

	(*) Read a text file - Streaming_SetPartitionAnalytics.txt - containing list of dictionaries, literal_eval() it and yield the elements as iterable
3.TextHistogramPartition is a fancy datasource which facilitates an alternative measure of streaming text analytics and text similarity
4.DictionaryHistogramPartition is the conventional datasource for succinctly representing a set partition which could be anything ranging from LSH partition, Exact Cover, Balls-Bins, Separate Chained Hashtables, Electronic Voting Machines based on LSH and Separate Chaining, Business Intelligence Histograms, SMS voting histograms, Music Spectrograms etc.,.
5.adjusted_rand_index() in Streaming_SetPartitionAnalytics.py instantiates both these datasource iterators and computes Adjusted Rand Index for two consecutive partitions in the stream by SciKitLearn adjusted_rand_score()
6.Because of the fact that every set partition is set of class labels in some classifier, various other clustering performance measures - mutual information, silhouette etc., (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#clustering-evaluation) could compare partitions too.
7.tocluster() in Streaming_SetPartitionAnalytics.py maps a partition to an array of labelled elements in scikitlearn format
8.An example streaming set partition analytics for linux kernel logs (TextHistogramPartition) and list of dictionaries (DictionaryHistogramPartition) is committed to Streaming_SetPartitionAnalytics.log.28March2019 which show how Adjusted Rand Index works for similar and dissimilar partitions.
9.For circumventing sklearn exception two compared partitions are truncated to minimum size of the two

651. (THEORY and FEATURE) Reduction from Set Partition to Exact Square Tiles Cover of Rectangular Region,
Lagrange Four Square Theorem, Complementary Sets, Computational Geometric Factorization, Space Filling, Tile Cover, Packing, Set Partition/Histogram Analytics, LSH Partitions, Separate Chaining Hashtables - 3 April 2019, 17 November 2019 - related to 649 and 650
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Python implementation for Set Partition Analytics (Streaming_SetPartitionAnalytics.py) has been updated for a new function which reduces a histogram set partition to exact square tiles cover of rectangular region which has area equal to number of elements in the histogram.
2.Function setpartition_to_tilecover() loops through histogram buckets (set partition) and maps each bucket size to sum of four squares by Lagrange Four Square Theorem essentially mapping each 1-dimensional bucket to 4 2-dimensional square tiles.
3.Collection of these sets of 4 square tiles covers the rectangular region of area equal to number of elements partitioned by histogram/LSH/Separate Chaining.
4.Example logs in testlogs/Streaming_SetPartitionAnalytics.log.3April2019 demonstrate reduction of histogram buckets [11,12,13,14,15] of total number of 65 elements to tile cover of rectangular region which has composite area 13*5=65:
square tiles for partition  11 : set([(0, 1, 1, 3)])
square tiles for partition  12 : set([(1, 1, 1, 3)])
square tiles for partition  13 : set([(1, 2, 2, 2)])
square tiles for partition  14 : set([(0, 1, 2, 3)])
square tiles for partition  15 : set([(1, 1, 2, 3)])
Lagrange Four Square Tiles Cover reduction of Set Partition  [11, 12, 13, 14, 15] : [0, 1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 1, 9, 1, 4, 4, 4, 0, 1, 4, 9, 1, 1, 4, 9]
5.This reduction indirectly solves factorization problem (complexity depends on sum of four squares) geometrically by following square tiles cover algorithm:
	5.1 Number to factorize N is partitioned arbitrarily by some integer partition and is isomorphic to a histogram
	5.2 Square tiles are obtained from partition by previous Lagrange Four Square reduction 
	5.3 Square tiles are geometrically juxtaposed/arranged to create a tiled rectangle sides of which are factors of N
	5.4 Finding an arrangement of tiles on a rectangular region can be formulated as a non-linear (quadratic) convex-concave optimization problem. If x1,x2,x3,...,xn are sides of square tiles:
	N = area of rectangle = sum of areas of square tiles = x1^2 + x2^2 + x3^2 + ... + xn^2
	= product of sum of sides of peripheral tiles
	= (c1*x1 + c2*x2 + ... + cn*xn)*(d1*x1 + d2*x2 + ... + dn*xn) for ci = 0 or 1, di = 0 or 1
	5.5 Solving N = x1^2 + x2^2 + x3^2 + ... + xn^2 = (c1*x1 + c2*x2 + ... + ck*xk + cn*xn)*((1-c1)*x1 + (1-c2)*x2 + ... + ck*xk + (1-cn)*xn) by Integer Programming for binary ci amounts to factorizing N (because tiles of the sides have to be mutually exclusive save corner tile)
	5.6 The corner square tile is common to both sides and ck = dk for exactly one square tile xk.
	
If Factorization is doable in PRAMs (and therefore in Nick's Class) as per previous sections on various parallel RAM polylogarithmic time algorithms for factoring (e.g Parallel Planar Point Location), geometric arrangement of square tiles in a rectangle is of polynomial time - find factors which are sides of rectangle, successively tile the rectangle by choosing largest square remaining. Many randomized algorithms are available for finding Lagrange Sum of squares. If the factors of N = p*q are known in polylogarithmic time finding the tile arrangement is by solving two linear programs:
	c1*x1 + c2*x2 + ... + ck*xk + ... + cn*xn = p
	(1-c1)*x1 + (1-c2)*x2 + ... + ck*xk + ... + (1-cn)*xn = q

which are underdetermined linear equations (n variables and 2 equations) and constraints are specified by complemented binary coefficients ci and 1-ci and ck=dk in the two equations for mutually excluding tiles in the sides of the rectangle except corner tile. This boolean coefficient complement constraint can be ignored if two sides of the rectangle can have tiles of similar squares. Another relaxation: Number of tiles can be unequal in either sides. Equations then are easier to interpret as:
	c1*x1 + c2*x2 + ... + ck*xk + ... + cm*xm = p
	d1*x1 + d2*x2 + ... + dk*xk + ... + dn*xn = q
subject to one constraint for corner tile ck=dk and number of variables m and n could be unequal. Number of variables m and n can be equated by additional |m-n| slack variables of zero coefficients in equation of lesser variables. From Rouche-Capelli theorem number of solutions to underdetermined system of equations is Infinite because rank of augmented matrix is < rank of coefficient matrix for underdetermined system of equations. Solutions can be found by many algorithms prominent being Gauss-Jordan elimination (Gaussian Elimination by Partial Pivoting-GEPP). GEPP has been proved to be P-complete problem. Previous system of equations are solved by GEPP post-factorization (sides of rectangle p,q are factors of N found by PRAM computational geometric factorization). If NC=P, both sides of rectangle and arrangement of square tiles on the sides of the rectangle can be done in NC by PRAM GEPP which is a depth-two parallelism. Without knowledge of factors, previous product (c1*x1 + c2*x2 + ... + cm*xm)*(d1*x1 + d2*x2 + ... + dn*xn) = pq = N is a quadratic program solving which is NP-Hard.

Point location by parallel construction of wavelet trees has been described in previous sections,which consider the set of points of a geometric variety (e.g points on rectified hyperbolic arc) on the plane as a string of points represented as a wavelet tree. Point Location by Parallel Wavelet Tree construction is more obvious than Parallel Point Location by Kirkpatrick Triangulation, Planar subdivision, Bridge Separator Trees etc.,. The string of points formed from rectified hyperbolic arc are concatenated straightline segments each of which is an arithmetic progression. Query select(B, N, i) returns the position p of the i-th occurrence of N in concatenated hyperbolic line segments string B from which i-th factors of N=(p, N/p) are obtained.

Previous reduction from set partition to tile cover by Lagrange Four Square Theorem is restricted to tiling 2-dimensional space. It can be generalized to filling/tiling arbitrary dimensional space by Chinese Remainder Theorem as follows:
	(*) Chinese Remainder Theorem states that there is a ring isomorphism between x mod N and (x mod n1, x mod n2, ..., x mod nk) for pairwise coprime integers n1,n2,...,nk and N = n1*n2*n3*...*nk (or) x mod N <=> (x mod n1, x mod n2, ..., x mod nk) which is an isomorphism between ring of integers mod N and direct product space of rings of integers modulo nk
	(*) By Chinese Remainder Theorem, there is a bucket of size x < N (so that x mod N = x) of the set partition which can be mapped isomorphically to a k-dimensional hypercube of sides (x mod n1, x mod n2, ..., x mod nk) modulo an integer N=n1*n2*...*nk (requires solving for x).
	(*) This Chinese Remaindering Reduction reduces 1-dimensional set partition to tiling arbitrary dimensional space

657. (THEORY) Depth-2 Majority Function, Theoretical EVMs, Set Partitions, People Analytics, Axiom of Choice - related to 546,490 and all sections on majority voting - 25 April 2019
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It has been mentioned in earlier sections on set partitions that every theoretical majority voting partitions the population into subsets or buckets indexed by the candidate voted for. Most realworld democracies follow the depth-2 majority voting division convention below:
					(Depth-0)
				 Winning affiliation
					/\
					||
	(Depth-1) {Segment1	     Segment2 	....		    SegmentP}
			/\		/\				/\
			||		||				||
(Depth-2) {EVM11 EVM12 ... EVM1N}  {EVM21 EVM22 ... EVM2N} 	{EVMP1 EVMP2 ... EVMPN}

and each EVM is defined by the hiearachy of partitions( candidates per segment might vary as n(1),n(2),...,n(P)) - votes per candidate k in q-th EVM of p-th segment (EVMpq) is denoted by ckpq :

	EVM11 = c111 + c211 + c311 + ... + cn(1)11 
	EVM12 = c112 + c212 + c312 + ... + cn(1)12
	...
	EVM21 = c121 + c221 + c321 + ... + cn(2)21
	...
	EVMP1 = c1P1 + c2P1 + c3P1 + ... + cn(P)P1
	...
Previous partition tree of depth-2 (i.e a tree whose nodes are set partitions) generalizes depth-2 boolean majority function to non-boolean setting and is an arithmetic circuit. At Depth-2 EVM set partitions per segment are summed up partwise (because all partitions within a segment should have equal number of parts which is the number of candidates per segment) and passed on to Depth-1 - in previous per segment partition identities summing vertically columnwise yields Depth-1 partition per segment. At Depth-1 index for candidate of maximum part/bucket size in segmentwise partition sum is computed and passed on to Depth-0. At Depth-0, single set partition is created which contains buckets per affiliation of the candidates. Maximum size part in Depth-0 set partition is the winning affiliation.

Whole depth-2 majority voting democratic process rests on the correctness of Axiom of Choice which avers: For a collection X of subsets, there always exists a choice function f such that for every set A in X, f(A) is an element of A. In previous example, at Depth-1, maximum() is the choice function applied across the board for all segment set partitions for choosing the winning candidate per segment (ruling out ties). It is readily obvious that each segment is a cluster of partitions and empirically distance between majority of EVM partitions of same segment (partition rank, rand index, mutual info) should not be abnormally high and reflects trend per segment.

By Berry-Esseen Central Limit Theorem, if vote for each candidate (ckpq) is a random variable, normalized sum of the votes for all candidates or average number of votes per candidate tends to normal distribution. In other words, every part in each of the EVM partitions previously is a random variable which are summed up. This implies distances between any two EVM partitions (which is the function of distance between individual parts in two voting partitions) also tend to distance between two normal distributions (i.e almost a constant on the average). Most importantly, columnwise sum of parts leading to per segment partition in Depth-1 is also an averaged normal distribution.

Ramanujan's Congruences for EVM partitions imply, for certain size of electorate (5k + 4, 7k + 5, 11k + 6) number of possible voting patterns (partition number or number of possible partitions) abides by following congruences:
	p(5k + 4) mod 5 = 0
	p(7k + 5) mod 7 = 0
	p(11k + 6) mod 11 = 0

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.DeepLearning_ConvolutionNetwork_BackPropagation.py has been changed to define a new utility function handwriting_recognition() which
loads two images of handwritings by CV2, thresholds them, finds contours of the two images and approximates the contours by Douglas-Peucker Polynomial (DP) and computes the hausdorff distance between the two DP approximate polynomials of the handwritten images.
2.testlogs/DeepLearning_ConvolutionNetwork_BackPropagation.log.5May2019 shows how 2 pairs of handwritten digits fare against hausdorff distance measure - 2 pictures of handwritten digit 1 (similar), 2 pictures of handwritten digits 1 and 8 (dissimilar)
3.Logs show DP polynomials of contours of 1 and 1 are close enough while DP polynomials of contours of 1 and 8 are far apart:
#############################################
Handwriting Recognition
#############################################
[[[1279  719]]]
[[[1276  719]]

 [[1279  719]]]
Distance between DP polynomials approximating two handwriting contours: (3.0, 0, 0)
[[[1279  719]]]
[[[  0 564]]]
Distance between DP polynomials approximating two handwriting contours: (1288.3578695378083, 0, 0)

4.Though image Contours and DP approximation are not traditional deep learning, previous contouring and DP approximation could as well be performed on convolution layers and maxpooling map layers of the two images as against images themselves.
5.Function handwriting_recognition() is supervised learner and takes two arguments - training (labelled) and test (unlabelled) images - and compares the unlabelled image to training image (printed or handwritten)
6.In the topological sense, each approximate DP polynomial for handwriting contours of same alphabet or digit are equivalent homeomorphic deformations in R^2. Handwritings of same person for similar text create a cluster of deformations which are close enough and create outliers for different persons.
7.Pattern grammars described earlier define grammatical rules similar to context free grammars for shape description. For example handwritten alphanumeric 'b' is defined as:
	<b> := <|> <operator> <o>
where <operator> could be <prefix> which tangentially attaches <|> before <o>. Following the convention above, a family or cluster of close-enough DP approximate polynomials fit in as operands within <> - e.g Coffee mug in 2 dimensions is homeomorphic to the letters 'D' and 'O' and all three (Mug, D, O) have close-enough DP Approximate polynomials of small hausdorff distances amongst them. Alternatively, Mug can be written as pattern grammar:
	<Mug> := <I> <prefix> <)> 
and <I> and <)> are defined by DP polynomials.

661.(THEORY and FEATURE) Music Pattern Mining - Weighted Automaton Learning from Music - 11 May 2019 - related to all sections on
Intrinsic Merit of Music
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Previous sections described ascertaining merit of music by various analyses of waveforms e.g MFCC, learning DFA from music notes. Apart from these there are standard measures viz., zero crossings, chroma which quantify genre or merit of music (https://librosa.github.io/librosa/feature.html).
2.Of these learning a deterministic finite automaton from strings of music notes is a qualitative intrinsic merit measure of music which does not involve any statistical processing.
3.Learning DFA is a computational learning theoretic problem (PAC Learning, Angluin Model etc.,). Weighted Deterministic Finite State Automata are generalizations of DFA in which state transitions have an associated numeric weightage in addition to alphabets from a language.
4.For example, weighted DFA below has the weighted transitions:
	(state1, a, state2) - transition from state1 to state2 on symbol a of weight 1
	(state2, 2b, state3) - transition from state2 to state3 on symbol b of weight 2
5.Weighted automata are apt formalisms to represent music notes strings as DFA because notes have subdivisions - sharp and flat - which can be likened to weightage for state transitions (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_note - CDEFGABC - ascending and descending graphic).
6.For example string of music notes - "CD(sharp)DEEGAF(flat)F(sharp)" - and its accepting weighted music automaton could be:
	state1, C, state2
	state2, Dsharp, state3
	...
	state10, Fflat, state5
	state6, Fsharp, state2
	...
where sharp and flat are weights for the transition symbol.
7.Scikit Learn SPLearn (scikit-splearn) provides a weighted automaton learning framework based on Spectral Theory.
8.This commit implements a Music Weighted Automaton python code in MusicWeightedAutomaton.py which accepts a set of training string of music notes and fits them to a weighted automaton using scikit-splearn. It makes predictions later based on training data.
9.Learnt weighted automaton for music notes string is drawn as DOT graph file by graphviz in MusicWeightedAutomaton.gv and is rendered to a pdf - MusicWeightedAutomaton.gv.pdf
10.Weighting the transition in music notes has an another advantage: Some portions of the music waveform are more impressive and catchy which makes them to be listened again - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earworm - and transitions for these could have heavy weights.
11.Alphabets in sample music notes strings for scikit-splearn are numeric encoded as - A:0,B:1,C:2,D:3,E:4,F:5,G:6

663. (FEATURE) Named Entity Recognition - Conditional Random Fields - Update - 16 May 2019
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.NamedEntityRecognition_HMMViterbi_CRF.py has been changed to removed hardcoded PoS tagged sentences and instead to read states and observations from two files: NamedEntityRecognition_HMMViterbi_CRF.states and NamedEntityRecognition_HMMViterbi_CRF.observations which have the semi-PoS tagged sentence PoS states and sentence word observations respectively.
2.Emission Probabilities for each state are computed by a skew normal distribution which moves the mean from left to right of the sentence as states progress.
3.This skew normal distribution gives more weightage to respective state than others while each state is observed.
4.An example log in testlogs/NamedEntityRecognition_HMMViterbi_CRF.log.16May2019 shows the skewing of probability weights from left to right of the sentence 
5.For example, Name-Verb-Object PoS tag is weighted as : First 1/3 of sentence has more weightage for emission probabilities of "Name",second 1/3 of sentence has more weightage for emission probabilities of "Verb" and third 1/3 of sentence has more weightage for emission probabilities of "Object"

665. (FEATURE) Named Entity Recognition - Conditional Random Fields - Skew Normal Distribution Update - 29 May 2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Miscellaneous changes in NamedEntityRecognition_HMMViterbi_CRF.py for corrections to skew normal distribution which shifts mean of the distribution for each part of speech to the right by some constant multiples.
2.Skew normal distribution mean shift for each state (part of speech) is shown in NamedEntityRecognition_HMMViterbi_CRF.29May2019.png
3.Motivation for skew normal distribution mean shift from left to right for emission probabilities is: For some part of speech state, successive word observations in the sentence receive more weightage corresponding to the peak value at mean i.e one word in the sentence peaks at mean and is more likely candidate observation emitted for respective Part of Speech state.
4.In this example 5 words in the sentence peak for 5 part of speech states.

666. (THEORY) Approximation of Majority Voting, Streaming majority, Forecasts, Bertrand Ballot Theorem, Theoretical EVMs, Set Partitions - 4 June 2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bertrand Ballot Theorem states: In a majority voting involving 2 candidates A and B receiving p and q votes respectively of total electorate p+q,probability of candidate A always being ahead of candidate B in counting of votes is (p-q)/(p+q). Approximation of Majority voting has important applications in psephological forecast (pre-poll and post-poll surveys) which samples electorate to predict the winner. In pure complexity theoretic perspective, as has been mentioned earlier, boolean majority gate can be alternatively represented by a set partition of 2 candidate buckets indexed 0 and 1 and maximum size candidate bucket index is the output of set partition boolean majority gate. It is also worth mentioning here that approximating a majority gate of n inputs by a much smaller gate of m inputs (m << n) is the complexity theoretic equivalent of forecasting a real-world majority voting of 2 candidates by sampling m voters from an electorate of size n. It is obvious that process of counting of votes creates instantaneous snapshots of the electorate set partition and any m sized (less than n) voter set partition snapshot is equivalent to a sampling of total electorate. In terms of set partition definition of majority gate, both buckets of voter set partition 0 and 1 grow over time and at any instant the set partition of total size m is a sampling of n voters.Votes for 2 candidates 1 and 0 can be drawn as timeseries polynomial curves (votes versus time) and intersection points of 2 curves are trend reversals contributing to the probability (p-q)/(p+q). Complexity theoretic majority gate assumes all the inputs at the leaves are immediately available which is not possible in approximation in which only m of n votes are known. Majority approximation gate predicts output of majority gate of n inputs by a majority gate of m inputs for m << n with some error probability. By Bertrand Ballot Theorem probability that a majority approximation gate of m inputs (snapshot at some time point) has the same output as an exact majority gate of n inputs is (p-q)/(p+q) for total electorate p+q=n and p voters for 0 or 1 and q voters for 1 or 0. If m=a+b for a voters for 0 or 1 and b voters for 1 or 0 in the sample approximation, sample betrand probability is assumed to be proportional to bertrand probability of total electorate:
	(p-q)/(p+q) = k*(a-b)/(a+b)
	(p-q)/n = k*(a-b)/m
	(p-q) = n*k*(a-b)/m
which extrapolates the sample to the entire electorate.

668. (THEORY) Computational Geometric Factorization - Average case Sequential Optimization, Stirling Approximation of Gamma Function, 
Sum of binary search times of each tile and some observations - related to 605 - 14 June 2019
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(*) Average number of tiles between two approximate prime factors m and (m+1) found by tile summation ray shooting:
		= (m+1)/[kloglogN - m - 1] - m/[kloglogN - m]
because number of tiles till m-th prime factor = n = m/[kloglogN - m] for m=1,2,3,...,kloglogN
(*) Thus total average sequential time to sweep binary search tiles in N/kloglogN spacing between 2 consecutive approximate factors found by ray shooting:
	= O([(m+1)/[kloglogN - m - 1] - m/[kloglogN - m]] * logN)
(*) Maximum number of tiles in N/kloglogN spacing occurs by minimizing denominator and setting m=kloglogN - 2:
	= O([(kloglogN - 2 + 1)/[kloglogN - kloglogN + 2 - 1] - (kloglogN - 2)/[kloglogN - kloglogN + 2]])
	= O(kloglogN - 1 - (kloglogN - 2)/2)
	= O(kloglogN)
=> Maximum time to binary search tiles in N/kloglogN spacing = O(loglogN * logN)
=> Each of O(loglogN) spacings between approximate factors can be searched in: 
	O((loglogN)^2*logN)
average case sequential time with no necessity for parallel processing.
(*) If each tile segment arithmetic progression is searched individually and sequentially, sum of binary search times for first k adjacent tile segments is:
	log N/(1*2) + log N/(2*3) + log N/(3*4) + ... + log N/(k*(k+1))
which can be written as:
	log N - (log 1 + log 2) +
	log N - (log 2 + log 3) +
	...
	log N - (log k + log (k+1))
by logarithmic identities and becomes:
	k log N - (log 1 + log (k+1) + 2 log k!)
But Gamma function is:
	Gamma(x+1) = x!
and by Stirling approximation:
	log k! ~= log Gamma(k+1) = (k+0.5)*log k - k -1 + 0.5*log 2*pi
Substituting in the summation:
Total time for binary searching k adjacent tile segment arithmetic progressions = k log N - log (k+1) - (2k + 1)log k + 2(k+1) - log (2*pi)

A variant approximation of this search time summation has been described in section 5 of http://sourceforge.net/projects/acadpdrafts/files/DiscreteHyperbolicPolylogarithmicSieveForIntegerFactorization_PRAM_TileMergeAndSearch_And_Stirling_Upperbound_updateddraft.pdf/download

if k is O(loglogN) from previous derivation of maximum number of tiles between 2 approximate prime factors, in average case atleast one factor can be found in average time:
	loglogN * log N - log (loglogN + 1) - (2loglogN + 1)logloglogN + 2(loglogN+1) - log (2*pi)
	<= O(logN * loglogN)

669. (THEORY) Computational Geometric Factorization, Ramsey Coloring and Arithmetic Progressions in the Tile Segments, Van Der Waerden
Numbers - related to 636 - 19 June 2019
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By Van Der Waerden theorem, for any positive integers r and k there is number N such that if the numbers {1,2,3,...,N} are colored, each with
one of the r different colors then there are atleast k integers in arithmetic progression whose elements are of same color. Computational
Geometric Factorization is based on rectification of hyperbolic curve into straightline or rectangular polygonal tile segments (of dimensions 1 * length_of_segment) and reducing the factorization problem to parallel RAM planar point location of factor points (i.e hyperbolic curve is rectified to a polygon containing arithmetic progression of products of ordinates as its rectangular faces, parallel planar point location finds a rectangular face of the polygon having the factor point N=pq in polylogarithmic time and the rectangular face arithmetic progression having factor point is binary searched in logarithmic time - thus in NC) in this rectified polygon. Each hyperbolic tile segment obtained by rectification are construed to be arrays of products of ordinates or arrays of ordered pair of ordinates in x-axis and y-axis. Unsorted Concatenation of these tile segments of ordered pair of ordinates has the x-axis or y-axis sorted ascending from 1 to N (or sqrt(N) to N). Since arrays of product or ordered pair of ordinates in each tile segment have one of the ordinates constant, each tile segment array is an arithmetic progression of ordinate products elements of which are colored monochromatically. Factor point location by parallel RAM sorting based on product of ordinates of ordered pairs in tile segments sorts the product of ordinates but shuffles the x-axis ordinate in ordered pair notation which was strictly ascending in unsorted concatenation. Sorted concatenation of tile segments of product of ordinates is the union of subsets of elements in each monochromatic arithmetic progression and creates a (pseudo)random coloring of sorted sequence of integers in the range {N-delta,N+delta}. In other words rectification of hyperbolic curve just inverts the Van Der Waerden theorem - instead of finding monochromatic arithmetic progressions in a colored sequence, it forms a mergesorted sequence from monochromatic arithmetic progressions in tile segments. Since rectification of hyperbolic curve for every integer creates unique set of tile segments, previous inverse of Van Der Waerden coloring is also unique.

670. (THEORY) Computational Geometric NC-PRAM Factorization, Tile Summation Ray Shooting Queries and Gamma approximation, Iterated addition for sum of tile segment lengths - 27 June 2019 - related to 506, 668
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tile summation ray shooting queries:
------------------------------------
Sum of lengths of first n tile segments of pixelated hyperbolic curve derived previously:
	N/[1*2] + N/[2*3] + ... + N/[n*(n+1)] = Nn/(n+1)
which can be equated to sum of distances between first m prime factors by Hardy-Ramanujan Theorem:
	Nn/(n+1) = mN/kloglogN

=> n = m/(kloglogN - m) = number of tiles till m-th prime factor. 

Gamma approximated tile summation ray shooting queries:
-------------------------------------------------------
Alternatively, sum of lengths of tiles obtained approximately from sum of binary search times by Gamma function previously can be equated to Hardy-Ramanujan normal order estimate:
	2^(n log N - log (n+1) - (2n + 1)log n + 2(n+1) + log (2*pi)) = mN/kloglogN
	(or) (n log N - log (n+1) - (2n + 1)log n + 2(n+1) + log (2*pi)) = log(mN/kloglogN)
and solved for number of tiles n that have to be summed till m-th prime factor. Total Binary Search time has been raised to exponent to get approximate total length searched. Solving logarithmic equation previously might require some logarithmic series approximation resulting in a cubic equation or higher degree in n depending on number of terms chosen from logarithmic series. 

An important fact ignored so far is the summing of tile lengths while doing ray shooting queries which has to be parallelized too. But tile summation is an iterated addition of O(N) logN bit integers (tile lengths are rounded off) which is in NC1. Thus Computational Geometric NC-PRAM planar point location factorization invoking tile summation ray shooting query oracles is in NC again. It can be noted that most other ray shooting query algorithms do not have this iterated addition of tile lengths requirement.

672. (FEATURE and THEORY) Intrinsic Merit of People/Professional Profiles - People Analytics - Tenure Histogram - 28 June 2019
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.People Analytics implementation has been updated to print Work and Academic Tenure stints as array (histogram or integer partition)
2.This essentially makes tenures as a set partition analytics problem because job and academic stint time durations can be picturized as
histograms.
3.Tenures represented as Set Partitions can be quantified by set partition measure of partition rank:
	Length of largest part in  partition - Number of parts in partition 
4.In the context of People Analytics, previous rank measure is quite applicable practically as attrition metric because:
	4.1 High partition rank implies the professional profile has spent large duration in an organization or number of tenure switches are less (number of parts)
	4.2 Low Partition rank implies the professional profile has low duration per organization or high number of tenure switches
5.Tenure Partition can be printed as Ferrer or Young Diagram and size of Durfee Square of this tenure partition is also a measure of average time spent per organization and thus an attrition metric

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. People Analytics implementation has been updated to include a function to compute Correlation Coefficients of Statistical Dependence between vectors of Tenure Histograms.
2. Tenure Histogram is deemed as a set of vectors of the form (organization/designation, income, duration) which captures the crucial factors of a tenure
3. New function tenure_partition_rank_correlation() has been implemented to compute rank correlations between each pair of variables of a tenure:
	3.1 Designations versus Remunerations
	3.2 Designations versus Durations
	3.3 Remunerations versus Durations
4.An example tenure histogram vectors of previous format has been analyzed (presently not parsed from profiles) for Kendall-Tau Rank correlation coefficient and logs are in testlogs/SocialNetworkAnalysis_PeopleAnalytics.log.1July2019
5.Previous correlations can be interpreted as below:
	5.1 Designations versus Remunerations - If positive or high, professional profile has increasing career graph along with increasing remunerations (expected). If negative or low, professional profile has increasing career graph vis-a-vis reduced remunerations (not expected - implies profile preferred more challenging roles than remuneration) and vice-versa (not expected - implies profile preferred better remuneration than designations)
	5.2 Designations versus Durations - If positive or high, profile has increasing career graph vis-a-vis durations of tenure (expected). If negative or low profile has increasing career graph vis-a-vis decreasing durations per tenure (not quite expected - increased designations  were not appealing to profile and person decided to leave) and vice-versa (not quite expected - decreasing responsibilities of the role were preferred by the profile which decided to stay longer) 
	5.3 Remunerations versus Durations - If positive or high, profile has increasing emoluments versus increasing durations per tenure (expected). If negative or low profile has increasing remunerations against decreasing durations per tenure (not quite expected - profile was more inclined to salary) and vice-versa (not quite expected - profile stayed longer per tenure despite decreasing benefits). 
6. Previous interpretations facilitate inferences (in parentheses) of why attritions could have happened.
7. From logs following positive and negative correlations are found and can be interpreted based on (5):
	Kendall Tau Rank Correlations - Designations and Remunerations: tau= 0.7142857142857143 , pvalue= 0.0301587301587

1.Analyzing Builtup land, Water bodies etc., of an urban sprawl is crucial for urban planners and is an apt application of image analysis. Urban sprawl is defined as arborescence (in graph theoretic terms) of suburban facegraph often delineated by traffic patterns, road densities and road gravity induced built-up surfaces and is not measured by governance limits. For example rankings of metropolitan areas in India from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_metropolitan_areas_in_India and https://www.hindutamil.in/news/tamilnadu/888256-spread-over-an-area-of-5-904-sq-km-with-4-corporations-12-municipalities-chennai-becomes-indias-3rd-largest-city.html are (based on 2022 estimates):

2.Convex Hull based on Scipy Spatial for urban sprawls has already been implemented in ImageGraph_Keras_Theano.py for GIS images from SEDAC (http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/mapping/popest/gpw-v4/) which is also invoked in Drone Online Shopping Delivery NeuronRain usecase
3.A Machine Learning (Random Forests) and entropy based analysis of Chennai Urban Sprawl - https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/19/4/163/pdf - studies the growth of built area and dwindling of water bodies from 1991 to 2016 and predicts scenario for 2027. Images referred to in this article are drawn from various Remote Sensing satellite sources (LandSat, ISRO-Bhuvan Geo Platform - https://bhuvan.nrsc.gov.in/bhuvan_links.php etc.,) and are great references for Chennai Urban Sprawl Land Usage,Water bodies,Greenery etc.,.
4.Images from https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/19/4/163/pdf have been extracted and are analyzed for Red, Green and Blue Channels in this commit. New python function analyze_remotesensing_RGB_patches() has been implemented for this which invokes OpenCV2 split() of the image to Red,Green,Blue channels.
5.Rationale for Red-Green-Blue Channel split of Urban Sprawl is most of the images are color coded in Red, Green and Blue for Built Area, Greenery and Water bodies respectively and splitting to respective color channels layers the image.
6.Each color channel - Red. Green and Blue - is a NumPy ndarray which is flattened and histograms are computed for each color channel.
7.Color channel images are written to JPG files of respective suffixes and read again to compute Numpy histogram
8.Each color channgel image is grayscale only and percentage of white pixels of value 255 is the sum total size of respective color patch in image.
9.Scikit Learn Image has extract_patches_2d() function - https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.image.extract_patches_2d.html - which can segment an image to patches or clusters of similar features. But a native implementation of patch extraction has been preferred for color coded GIS Remote Sensing images.
10.Ratio of white pixels to total number of pixels is computed from color channel image histograms as:
Size of 255 (white) bucket in image ndarray histogram / Sum of sizes of all buckets in image ndarray histogram
11.Images extracted from https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/19/4/163 and their color channel images have been committed to ImageNet/testlogs/RemoteSensingGIS/
12.Logs for this are committed to testlogs/ImageGraph_Keras_Theano.log.RemoteSensingGIS.3July2019 which print the percentage of water bodies (blue), built area (red) and greenery (green) inferred from color channels
13.Alternatively, image ndarray itself could have been mapped to histograms and ratio of respective pixel color value buckets could have been computed. But exact color value for each color coding is not known and color channels grayscale the images and just number of white pixels (255) have to be found.

676. (FEATURE) Image Analytics - ImageNet Keras-Theano - Random Forest Classification wrapper for images - 4 July 2019
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.New wrapper function has been implemented which invokes scikit learn Random Forests - https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html#sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.predict to classify set of test images based on
training images and training labels.
2.This wrapper function random_forest_image_classification() pre-processes the training and test images by loading to CV2 and flattening the
image ndarray and then reshaping and transposing it so that scikit learn accepts.
3.First the random forest classifier which is a forest of lot of decision trees which vote to decide the class label of a sample, is trained by fit() for training images and then test images are labelled by predict()
4.Logs for this are committed to ImageGraph_Keras_Theano.log.RandomForests.4July2019
5.Scikit learn provides train_test_split function which divides set of samples into training and test images based on which fit() and predict() are invoked.
6.Alternative version without training and test split also follows the above as in logs.

677. (FEATURE) Image Analytics - ImageNet Keras-Theano - Unsupervised Recursive Gloss Overlap classifier based on ImageNet - 5 July 2019
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.As opposed to Random Forest classifier implemented earlier based on scikit learn, NeuronRain unsupervised graph theoretic Recursive Gloss Overlap classifier has been applied for some test images
2.Recursive Gloss Overlap classify() function has been invoked from imagenet_imagegraph() which was earlier only creating text graph from Keras
 predictions text for the image.
3.Example Dense subgraph (core number) classifications for these images in the logs at testlogs/ImageGraph_Keras_Theano.log.ImageNetClassifier.5July2019 are reasonably accurate and classify the images better. No training labelled data are required.

678. (THEORY) Majority Hardness Amplification Lemma, Noise Sensitivity, Sensitivity, Block Sensitivity, Condorcet Jury Theorem  - 6 July 2019, 6 October 2019 - related to 517 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hardness of a boolean function has been defined previously as how hard computationally it is to compute the function with a circuit of size s:
	if Pr(C(x) != f(x)) = delta where C(x) computes boolean function f(x), then f(x) delta-hard.
Hardness amplification for Majority + VoterSAT boolean composition has been derived earlier as:
	Hardness Amplification for Majority+Voter Composition <= 1/(delta + or - error)*(1/2-1/3*pi) + 1/pi + 6k*pi*(delta + or - error)^0.5
for delta-hard voter SAT boolean functions (i.e Probability of a circuit incorrectly computing a voter SAT = delta)

Noise Sensitivity of Majority function has been previously mentioned as O(1/sqrt(n*epsilon)) where epsilon is probability of flip per bit. Therefore epsilon is nothing but probability that a voter boolean function is incorrectly computed and sent as input to Majority function. This implies Pr(f(x) != C(x)) = delta = epsilon = hardness of all voter functions.

In all sections related to majority voting and majority+voterSAT boolean composition, measure of sensitivity used is Noise Sensitivity which is Pr(f(x) != f(y)) for 2 correlated boolean strings x and y in {0,1}^n and sensitivity and block sensitivity measures have been ignored. Lemma 15 in reference 678.1 provides a simple boolean hypercube random walk proof of relation between sensitivity and Noise sensitivity from which:
	NoiseSensitivity(f) <= 2*delta*sensitivity for probability of a bit flip = delta = epsilon
	=> NoiseSensitivity(Majority) = O(1/sqrt(n*epsilon)) <= 2*delta*sensitivity

Since sensitivity conjecture (block sensitivity <= poly(sensitivity)) has been proved recently, sensitivity in previous inequality can be written as a function of block sensitivity. Majority Hardness Amplification ratio then can be written as:

 Hardness of Maj+voter composition       [c/sqrt(n*delta)] +/- randomerror
-----------------------------------  =  ------------------------------ 	  <= 2*delta*sensitivity/delta +/- error <= 2*sensitivity +/- error
   Hardness of voter function                  delta

which upperbounds the maximum hardness amplification of Majority+VoterSAT composition almost as twice of sensitivity of majority function.

Recent versions of Condorcet Jury Theorem by [Black] and [Ladha] lay emphasis on correlated voting in which voters are not independent but are statistically dependent and swayed by peer opinions en masse (this is the most prevalent "Herding" phenomenon in real world voting and in social networks), and from [Ladha] performance of majority voting decreases as correlation increases. In boolean majority function this herding correlation of bits is formalized by Block sensitivity and flipping a contiguous block of bit positions (contiguous set of voters flip their decisions) changes the outcome of the majority function. From [Ladha] more block sensitive (more correlated voters) majority function is less effective it is and towards less goodness it tends to.

NOTE: Throughout all sections on Majority Voting + VoterSAT boolean composition and its hardness amplification, Sensitivity measures have been assumed as main contributors to hardness because by definition a hard boolean function is not 100% correctly computable by a circuit and sensitivity to input correlation (flipped bits) is the major factor preventing the correct computation by circuit. There could be other factors intrinsic to boolean function itself too apart from sensitivity measures which prevent a circuit from being perfect characterized by (+/-) error term above - randomized decision tree evaluation being one of them.

679. (FEATURE and THEORY) Fraud Analytics - Principal Component Analysis and KMeans++ clustering of an example Credit Card Transactions
Dataset - 8 July 2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.This commit implements a rudimentary primitive fraud analytics Python class
2.Fraud Analytics in the context of NeuronRain has already been implemented to some extent in USBmd as wireless LAN traffic analytics and ftrace based analysis which is a low level intrusion fraud analytics
3.To broaden the purview new file FraudAnalytics.py has been added to AstroInfer repositories and a basic fraud analysis function for credit card data set from https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/downloads/creditcardfraud.zip/3 has been implemented - creditcard_fraud_analytics()
4.Traditional algorithm to analyze frauds is to find the outliers in a dataset which are deviations from the normal.
5.This function applies kmeans++ clustering from scikit learn to classify the previous kaggle creditcard transactions dataset into two clusters 0 (normal) and 1 (potential fraud).
6.Kaggle dataset is in CSV format and first 500 rows of it are read by python CSV reader and a NumPy ndarrays are created from it which splits 
the transactions into 150 rows training set and 350 rows test set.
7.Columns of the CSV file are Time, 28 columns which obfuscate the identity of the cardholder, Amount, label 0 or 1 (normal or fraud) which are real transactions happened in 2013 and each column is considered as a dimension for tranasaction vector
8.Classifying high dimensional data has variety of clustering algorithms including kmeans++ (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html)
9.To simiplify high dimensional data, convention followed is to apply Principal component Analysis to reduce the number of dimensions and then do clustering. e.g https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html, https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/cluster/plot_kmeans_digits.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-cluster-plot-kmeans-digits-py
10.Therefore previous credit card transactions vectors are clustered by fit() of the train dataset followed by predict() for test dataset.
11.Both predictions- with and without PCA - have been printed for 350 rows test dataset (0 - normal,1 - fraud):

4.Earth Mover Distance is the amount of work required to transform one distribution (set partition or histogram) to another distribution (another set partition or histogram) and thus is distance measure between two set partitions.
5.A miniature music recommender systems has been implemented based on MFCC earth mover distance which analyzes pair of music files for MFCCs and finds the earth mover similarity between the mean of MFCCs of two music files.
6.Pairwise earth mover distances (EMD) are sorted by values of similarity (low EMD values imply high similarity)
7.3 music files have been pairwise analyzed for MFCC EMD similarity for example (2 files of Bach Sonata and 1 file of Veena Instrumental - S.Balachander's Amritavarshini - respective copyrights attributed) 
8.Though number of files analyzed is small, Bach Sonata files have high EMD similarities compared to Bach and Veena Instrumental suggesting a clustering of oriental and western classical music in terms of spectral analysis.

682. (THEORY) KRW Conjecture, Majority + VoterSAT Boolean Function Composition, BKS Conjecture, Computing any function by Parity - 12 July 2019, 17 July 2019, 18 July 2019, 19 July 2019, 22 July 2019 - related to 365, 368 and all sections on Majority Voting
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boolean function composition of Majority and any Voter boolean function and its relevance to KRW Conjecture (Depth(f+g) ~= Depth(f) + Depth(g) or FormulaSize(f+g) ~= FormulaSize(f) * FormulaSize(g)) and Communication Complexity - KW Relations - which is an open problem - have been described in detail earlier and an inequality below for lower bound on depth of circuit computing Majority+VoterSAT composition has been derived assuming KRW conjecture:
	D(Maj + Voter) = CommunicationComplexity(R(Maj,Voter)) >= 5.3*logm  + n - O(m*logm/n)
for m voters having voter SATs of n variables per voter.

KRW Conjecture for composing any boolean function f and parity has been proved by [Hastad] and [Dinur-OrMeir]. Proving the general case of KRW conjecture implies P != NC1 (not all sequential polytime algorithms are logdepth parallelizable). If every Voter boolean functions are computable by circuits of AND, OR and Parity function, previous composition of Majority + VoterSAT is reduced to Majority + function_of(Parity) composition replacing Voter SAT circuit by a circuit of AND, OR and parity gates. Recent result in reference 682.2 delves on upperbounds and lowerbounds for computing symmetric and threshold boolean functions by parity gates (Razborov approximation of AND and OR by low degree polynomials on F[2] and composing them). Voter decision function can also be thought of as a threshold function (weighting the variables). Stability of Interview TQBF has been derived earlier in the context of BKS Conjecture by formalizing a question-answering in machine learning and learning theory as a weighted linear threshold function on answers to questions and their respective weights. Generalizing proof of KRW Conjecture for composing a function and parity to composition of a function and function_of(parity) proves the general case of KRW Conjecture. In reference 682.4 previous Communication Complexity (CC) Lower bound of composition has been refined to CC(KWf + Un) ≥ log L(f) + n − 2 log m − 10 implying CC(Majority+Voter) ≥ 5.3*log m + n − 2*log m − 10 assuming a universal Voter relation.

Assuming Voter SATs are indeed Linear or Polynomial Threshold Functions by which each voter scores the candidate to vote (0 or 1) based on some variables (e.g answers to questions) and votes for or against based on if the evaluated LTF or PTF exceed threshold or not, is a learning theoretic perspective as opposed to SAT based decision making. An experimental proof of BKS Conjecture (Majority is least stable) previously is restricted to LTFs only. Polynomial Threshold Functions have a circuit representation of depth 2 consisting of Parity and Threshold gates - layer 1 of parity gates for each monomial and layer 2 of a single threshold gate. From classic result of [Minsky-Papert], any computable function can be written in terms of threshold function. Circuit representation of Polynomial Threshold Functions are thus helpful to compute any Voter Decision Function in terms of Parity and Threshold gates. By Chow's Theorem for threshold functions, any 2 functions f (LTF) and g (any function) are equivalent if the degree-0 and degree-1 Fourier coefficients in Fourier expansion of f and g are equal.

Assuming KRW Conjecture, Formula Size of the Majority + VoterSAT boolean composition is:
	FormulaSize(Majority + VoterSAT) ~= FormulaSize(Majority) * FormulaSize(VoterSAT)
	=> FormulaSize(Majority + VoterSAT) ~=  m^5.3 * FormulaSize(VoterSAT) 
		(Formula Size implies the circuit composition has fanout 1)
It is known that set of languages of Turing Machine deciding an input in time(t) is contained in set of languages accepted by a circuit of size(tlogt). Combining this to the previous composition formula size bound assuming KRW Conjecture an estimated runtime of a Turing Machine equivalent to Majority + VoterSAT composition can be obtained by solving for t in the equality:
	tlogt = m^5.3 * FormulaSize(VoterSAT)
	(or) t^t = 2^(m^5.3 * FormulaSize(VoterSAT))

if t=O(FormulaSize(VoterSAT)):
logt = k*m^5.3 (or) t = 2^(k*m^5.3) for some constant k which is an EXPTIME Turing Machine (i.e exponential in number of voters) for Majority Voting Circuit Composition, implying unbounded depth.

PTF can encode a CNF MAX k-SAT - Example:
(x1 V !x3 V x4) /\ (x2 V x3 V x5) /\ (x1 V !x2 V x3) can be encoded as 3-sparse PTF (x1)(1-x3)(x4) + (x2)(x3)(x5) + (x1)(1-x2)(x3) >= k

683.(THEORY) Proof of KRW Conjecture for Majority+VoterSAT/VoterPTF composition - related to 682 - 23 July 2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Caution: This section is experimental and subject to errors

Previously a reduction from CNF MAX-k-SAT to PTFSAT was described with an example. Any Voter SAT can be encoded as a Polynomial Threshold Function g and any Polynomial Threshold Function can be computed by a Threshold-of-Parities circuit of depth 2 described in previous section:
	g = threshold + parity
If Majority function is denoted by f, Majority + VoterSAT/VoterPTF composition can be written in terms of parity as:
	f + g = f + threshold + parity
But composition is associative and therefore:
	(f + threshold) + parity = f + (threshold + parity)
But composition (f + threshold) previously can be any function h:
	(f + threshold) + parity = h + parity
which is composition of some function and parity and KRW conjecture for composing any function and parity has been already proved ([Hastad],[Andreev],[Dinur]) and thus KRW Conjecture for Majority + VoterSAT/VoterPTF composition is proved immediately because previous breakdown of any function as threshold of parities reduces Majority + VoterSAT/VoterPTF composition to composition of any function to parity. 

For a general case of composing any function f to another function g, applying previous threshold of parities representation to both f and g:
	f + g = (threshold + parity) + (threshold + parity)
and applying associativity of composition:
	f + g = (threshold + parity + threshold) + parity

685. (FEATURE) People Analytics - Kaggle LinkedIn Dataset Analysis - 26 July 2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. This commit introduces a new function in People Analytics implementation - linkedin_dataset_tenure_analytics() - which parses Kaggle LinkedIn dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/killbot/linkedin and computes various correlation coefficients between column attributes.
2. Following are the People Analytics field attributes in LinkedIn obfuscated dataset which has almost 15000 rows:
['avg_n_pos_per_prev_tenure', 'avg_pos_len', 'avg_prev_tenure_len', 'c_name', 'm_urn', 'n_pos', 'n_prev_tenures', 'tenure_len', 'age', 'beauty', 'beauty_female', 'beauty_male', 'blur', 'blur_gaussian', 'blur_motion', 'emo_anger', 'emo_disgust', 'emo_fear', 'emo_happiness', 'emo_neutral', 'emo_sadness', 'emo_surprise', 'ethnicity', 'face_quality', 'gender', 'glass', 'head_pitch', 'head_roll', 'head_yaw', 'img', 'mouth_close', 'mouth_mask', 'mouth_open', 'mouth_other', 'skin_acne', 'skin_dark_circle', 'skin_health', 'skin_stain', 'smile', 'african', 'celtic_english', 'east_asian', 'european', 'greek', 'hispanic', 'jewish', 'muslim', 'nationality', 'nordic', 'south_asian', 'n_followers'] which include average variables for tenure, positions or designations per tenure, number of previous tenures, tenure lengths etc.,
3.Pairwise kendall-tau Correlation coefficients of 3 important variables are computed:
	- average number of positions per previous tenure
	- average length of a position
	- average length of previous tenures
4.Some preprocessing of the linkedin CSV dataset was required to cast the type to integer
5.VectorAssembler is instantiated to create necessary subset projections of the linkedin dataset columns
6.5 important columns of the Spark CSV dataframe are sliced by list comprehension to 5 arrays for (ethnic, emotional, physical and racial fields are ignored):
	- average number of positions per previous tenure
	- average length of a position
	- average length of previous tenures
	- number of previous tenures
	- tenure length 
and mapped to a Pandas DataFrame which supports correlation matrix for all datatypes
7.Pandas correlation matrix is printed for these 5 fields:
				avg_n_pos_per_prev_tenure  avg_pos_len  avg_prev_tenure_len  n_prev_tenures  tenure_len
avg_n_pos_per_prev_tenure                   1.000000     0.804373             0.836112        0.836637    0.832915
avg_pos_len                                 0.804373     1.000000             0.983461        0.978873    0.993264
avg_prev_tenure_len                         0.836112     0.983461             1.000000        0.968333    0.975659
n_prev_tenures                              0.836637     0.978873             0.968333        1.000000    0.981673
tenure_len                                  0.832915     0.993264             0.975659        0.981673    1.000000

8.In addition to basic designation(position),remuneration, tenure duration correlations implemented earlier previous variables provide fine grained pattern analysis.
9,From previous correlation matrix, an obvious negative or low correlation is:
	 avg_n_pos_per_prev_tenure - versus - (avg_prev_tenure_len, n_prev_tenures, tenure_len)
implying increased average number of designations(positions) in previous tenures implies low average previous tenure lengths, low number of previous tenures and low tenure length which (exluding low number of previous tenures) is against what intuition suggests.

687. (THEORY) Approximate Polynomials and Approximate Degree of Boolean Functions, Dual Polynomials, Hardness Amplification, KRW Conjecture, Boolean Composition of Majority and VoterSAT/VoterPTF, Communication Complexity, Linear Program Primal/Dual - related to 365, 368, 682 - 
27 July 2019
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
From 682.13, the approximate degree of a Boolean function f : {−1, 1}^n → {−1, 1}, denoted deg g(f), is the least degree of a real polynomial p such that |p(x) − f(x)| ≤ 1/3 for all x ∈ {−1, 1}^n. Existence of approximate polynomials implies that the function is easy. Therefore non-existence of approximate polynomials implies the function is hard. Fact that f can be approximated by a real polynomial is equivalent to feasibility of a Linear Program on Fourier coefficients. Feasibility of dual of this linear program on Fourier Coefficients implies the primal boolean function is hard to approximate by a real polynomial and thus is an alternative way to prove hardness of boolean functions and their compositions especially block-compositions and is quite relevant to Majority+VoterSAT composition and KRW-Communication Complexity based size and depth lowerbounds of it previously derived based on Sensitivity measures. Approximate degree of t-threshold functions is sqrt(t(n-t)) and approximate degree of Majority or Parity is Theta(n). From [Nisan-Szegedy], approxdegree(f) <= degree(f) <= DecisionTree(f) < 1296*degree(f)^8. From [Sherstov] theorem, approxdegree(Majority + VoterSAT) = approxdegree(Majority) * approxdegree(VoterSAT) <= DecisionTree(Majority)*DecisionTree(VoterSAT).

Approximate Polynomial for Majority exists from 687.2 and has approximate degree theta(n) and therefore has n roots from Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. This approximate polynomial for Majority can be written as factorized product (assuming reducibile polynomials over field of reals):
	Product(x-xi) i=1,2,3,...,n

Previous product for approximate polynomial for majority can be expressed by an Algebraic/Arithmetic Circuit of depth-2 having 2n leaves (2 leaves per factor) and n intermediate minus gates in depth-1. Root is a multiplication gate of fanin n:
							* (multiplication operator - Root)

				-	-	-	-	-	... - (minus operators - Depth 1)

			     x    x1  x   x2  x   x3  x   x4  x   x5	  x   xn (operands - Depth 2)

Similarly if there exists an approximate polynomial (assuming reducible over field of reals) for an arbitrary VoterSAT/VoterPTF arithmetic circuit of approximate degree d it can be factorized and represented by an Algebraic/Arithmetic circuit of depth-2 having 2d leaves, d intermediate minus gates at depth-1 and multiplication gate at root. Since both arithmetic circuits for Majority and VoterSAT/VoterPTF have fanout 1, both can be termed arithmetic formulas. Thus approximate polynomials for Majority and VoterSAT/VoterPTF have arithmetic circuits of size O(approxdegree). Block Composing Majority arithmetic formula and VoterSAT/VoterPTF arithmetic formula is fairly straightforward in this special setting and ArithmeticFormulaSize(approxpoly(Majority)+approxpoly(VoterSAT)) = ArithmeticFormulaSize(approxpoly(Majority)) * ArithmeticFormulaSize(approxpoly(VoterSAT)) = O(n*d). This is an approximate version of KRW conjecture and O(n*d) could be Theta(n*d) because factorization lowerbounds the number of arithmetic gates. Over field of reals, every irreducible polynomial has degree 1 or 2 at most. Previous algebraic circuit assumes degree 1 irreducibility. For degree 2, instead of factors of the form (x-xi), factors are ax^2 + bx + c which require arithmetic subcircuits as below increasing depth by 1 and size multiplies by 4:
						+

					*	*	*

				  a   x   x   b   x   c    1

An already known result in reference 688.4 implies intersection of set of polynomials computed by non-uniform arithmetic circuits of polynomial size and set of polynomials of constant degree is equal to intersection of set of polynomials computed by nonuniform arithmetic circuits of polynomial size and logN*logN depth and set of polynomials of constant degree for all fields F. This implies each of the arithmetic circuit for approximate univariate polynomial over field of reals of a boolean function is a logN * logN depth circuit. Assuming degree 1 irreducible factors throughout previously for approximate real polynomials of both functions f and g, an estimate of depth lowerbound of the block composition of f and g can be arrived at:
	Depth(f + g) ~= Depth(f) + Depth(g) ~ 2*logN*logN

1.Time Series implementation has been made to a new python source file containing time series algorithms implementations for ARMA and ARIMA - Streaming_TimeSeriesData.py
2.Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Averages (ARIMA) has been implemented as a function ARIMA in Streaming_TimeSeriesData.py and factoring has been implemented for a parameter lag in autoregression_factored()
3.ARIMA differs from ARMA in factoring the autoregression polynomial into two factor polynomials one which is dependent on a lag operator.
4.Because Yahoo finance and Google Finance stock data are no longer available, ystockquote does not work and throws urllib exception and hence a hardcoded array of timeseries stock close data has been used.
5.ARMA and ARIMA functions from Streaming_TimeSeriesData.py are invoked in Streaming_StockMarketData.py.

1. ARMA and ARIMA related functions in Streaming_TimeSeriesData.py have been rewritten based on ARMA and ARIMA polynomials in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average
2. Projection iterations have been removed and instead are done in the invoking source file e.g Streaming_StockMarketData.py for randomly chosen regression weights
3. ARMA polynomial is computed as:
    arma=timeseries[len(timeseries)-1] - autoregression(time_series_data[pprime:]) - moving_averages(time_series_data[q:], 5)
which subtracts the autoregression and moving averages from the latest timeseries point. ARMA parameters pprime and q are sliced to be as distant from the latest timeseries point
4. ARIMA polynomial is computed as:

which computes autoregression_factored differently as:
5.Lag operator for lag d is applied to slice the timeseries data from latest point t to d as t-d and autoregression_factored() is invoked to compute regressions from slice t-d-p to t-d 
6.Finally the autoregression is subtracted from latest timeseries point Xt and moving averages is added to it

692. (FEATURE) Time Series Analysis - ARMA and ARIMA implementations - Rewrite 2 - 3 August 2019
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. ARMA and ARIMA functions in Streaming_TimeSeriesData.py have been again refactored to implement lag operator and binomial expansion of
lag factor in ARIMA polynomial
2. autoregression_factored() has been rewritten to invoke a new function lag_factor_binomial_expansion() which in turn expands the factor power term in ARIMA polynomial by binomial series expansion of (1-L)^d.
3. lag_factor_binomial_expansion() loop invokes functions binomial_term() which computes the numerator and denominator factorial of each binomial term and lag() function for each binomial term.
4. Example logs for Stock quotes timeseries data is at Streaming_StockMarketData.ARIMATimeSeries.log.3August2019 which has comparative projections of rewritten ARMA and ARIMA functions.
5. ARIMA has been invoked by parameters (2,2,2)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.FraudAnalytics.py has been updated to import TimeSeries ARMA and ARIMA functions from Streaming_TimeSeriesData.py and compute ARMA and ARIMA polynomials on amounts withdrawn timeseries in credit card transactions dataset.
2.Logs for these projections are at testlogs/FraudAnalytics.log.3August2019
3.Though timeseries is a perfect fit for analyzing credit card amounts withdrawn as timeseries, projection curves for ARMA and ARIMA in logs are skewed widely for multiple iterations of random weights in autoregression and moving averages but values of ARMA and ARIMA are uniformly same almost.

Regressions.
2.Linear And Logistic Regressions are estimators of Intrinsic Economic Merit of Nations in Economic Networks. Thus far following classes of intrinsic merit have been researched and implemented in NeuronRain:

	8. People - Professional Networks - HR Analytics - Attrition model
and Economic merit of nations is the 9th class of intrinsic merit applicable to Economic Networks. Regression is one amongst the set of econometric techniques for ascertaining growth of economies:
	9. Nations - GDP, HDI etc.,
3. Logs for the previous are at testlogs/LinearAndLogisticRegression.log.4August2019

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Named Entity Recognition by Conditional Random Fields Hidden Markov Model has been updated significantly for resolving some errors in Viterbi computation
2.Prior Emission Probabilities computation by skew normal distribution has been updated to renormalize by dividing the skewnorm probability by sum of probabilities
3.New part of speech "adverb" has been included in transition probabilities,emission probabilities and states
4.weighted sknorm has been done away with and replaced by previous renormalized skewnorm distribution
5.Error in argmax() computation has been corrected - label and maximum are reset in the loop
6.logs for this rewrite have been committed to testlogs/NamedEntityRecognition_HMMViterbi_CRF.log.12August2019
7.Transition probabilities are updated as below:
transition_probabilities={ 'noun':{'noun':0.0, 'verb':0.3, 'object':0.2, 'adjective':0.1, 'adverb':0.1, 'conjunction':0.3},
                          'verb':{'noun':0.1, 'verb':0.0, 'object':0.4, 'adjective':0.2, 'adverb':0.1,'conjunction':0.3},
                          'object':{'noun':0.0, 'verb':0.1, 'object':0.4, 'adjective':0.1, 'adverb':0.1,'conjunction':0.3},
                          'adjective':{'noun':0.4, 'verb':0.2, 'object':0.2, 'adjective':0.0, 'adverb':0.1, 'conjunction':0.1},
                          'adverb':{'noun':0.1, 'verb':0.4, 'object':0.1, 'adjective':0.0, 'adverb':0.1, 'conjunction':0.3},
                          'conjunction':{'noun':0.2, 'verb':0.4, 'object':0.1, 'adjective':0.1, 'adverb':0.1, 'conjunction':0.1}
                         } 
7.It has to be mentioned here that previous state transition probabilities priors are hardcoded heuristics and based on the following rationale:
	7.1 verb follows nouns more often
	7.2 object follows verb more often
	7.3 object follows object more often
	7.4 noun follows adjective more often
	7.5 verb follows adverb more often
	7.6 verb follows conjunction more often (e.g infinitives)
8.Previous heuristics are minimal and could be replaced by more sophisticated probability distribution learnt from a training dataset once and loaded everytime.

697. (THEORY-FEATURE) Named Entity Recognition and Text Graph Algorithms in NeuronRain AstroInfer - a non-statistical alternative - 12 August 2019
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TextGraph algorithms in NeuronRain are two-fold:
	697.1 Recursive Gloss Overlap - Project WordNet to a Subgraph by traversing the Synsets recursively
	697.2 Recursive Lambda Function Growth - Project WordNet to a Subgraph by traversing the Synsets recursively, learn AVL tree based Graph Tensor Neural Network and Lambda expressions from cycles and random walks of the WordNet subgraph - this is the maximum attainable theoretical limit of learning a formal language (Turing Machine or a lambda function) from natural language

Usual Named Entity Recognition algorithms are prior probabilities and Conditional Random Fields-HMM based which relies heavily on statistics ignoring linguistic deep structure. Instead if missing Part-of-Speech tags could be inferred from a textgraph representation of a partially PoS annotated text, no language PoS priors are required. Following algorithm explores this alternative:
	697.3 Partial PoS annoted text is mapped to a text graph by previous algorithms and each word vertex in the partial annotated text is labelled by either a part of speech or ? for missing PoS tag.
	697.4 Resultant text graph thus has mixture of word vertices which have either PoS known (labelled by a PoS name) or PoS unknown (labelled by ?)
	697.5 WordNet has support for list of all possible PoS tags for a word vertex
	697.6 It is then a problem of inferring most probable disambiguating PoS tag for a word vertex. 
	697.7 Set of all wordnet paths between a PoS annotated word vertex and an adjacent PoS unannotated word vertex provide set of sequences
of PoS tags for the paths.'
	697.8 For example phrase "can be called as a function" annotated as "conjunction conjunction verb conjunction conjunction ?" and unannotated "function" has three possible wordnet PoS tags which have to be disambiguated - Noun, Verb and Object and set of wordnet paths between "as-a" and "function" could be - {"connective","entity","work"},{"article","entity","event"},{"one","entity","happening"} having PoS sequences as {noun,noun,verb}, {noun,noun,noun} and {noun,noun,noun} if function has lemma synsets "work","event" or "happening"
	697.9.Of the three possible paths PoS "noun" for "function" wins by majority voting of 2 to 1 because 2 paths have a penultimate vertices which imply "function" is a noun.

698. (FEATURE) GIS Remote Sensing Image Analytics - Image Segmentation - 13 August 2019
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.New function image_segmentation() has been defined in ImageGraph_Keras_Theano.py which segments an image into similar regions or patches
2.As opposed to RGB patches and extract_patches_2d() of scikit learn, segmentation of an image is generic and segments/patches of arbitrary irregular shapes and containing similar pixels can be extracted
3.Example code in OpenCV2 documentation - https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_imgproc/py_watershed/py_watershed.html - has been used as reference 
4.This example filters the image into foreground and background by:
	4.1 applying OTSU threshold filter
	4.2 morphological opening for removal of noise
	4.3 Background - Dilation to increase object boundary to background and demarcate background accurately
	4.4 Foreground - Distance transform and then thresholding is applied to demarcate the foreground 
	4.5 Markers - Connected components are found from foreground of 4.4
	4.6 Watershed - watershed segmentation algorithm is applied on the marked image to find segments.
5.Watershed algorithm works by considering an image as topographic surface of valleys and dams between valleys. Valleys in image are filled with water till no two adjacent valleys merge creating "dams" or segments bounding the valleys.
6.Watershed segmentation is graphically illustrated in http://www.cmm.mines-paristech.fr/~beucher/wtshed.html
7.EventNet Tensor Products Merit algorithm for visuals described earlier depends on bounding box segmentation which are squares. Instead segmentation could be the way to go if ImageNet and Keras support it.
8.Two segmented satellite images of Chennai Metropolitan Area Urban Sprawl are committed at:
	8.1 testlogs/RemoteSensingGIS/ChennaiUrbanSprawl_Page-10-Image-15_segmented.jpg

700.(THEORY) Computational Geometric Factorization, Complement Diophantines, Covering a set by Arithmetic Progressions, Ramsey Coloring -
related to 24,477,491,636 - 14 August 2019
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Computational geometric factorization works by parallel planar point location - rectification of Hyperbolic arc bow into straightline segments which are then made to segment tree, wavelet tree, interval tree etc., by parallel RAM construction or segments are parallel RAM mergesorted and binary searched to find factors and thus factorization (finding all factors of an integer) is in Nick's class. It has been mentioned earlier that each segment of rectified hyperbolic arc bow is an arithmetic progression which facilitates local binary search without necessity for parallel mergesort. Thus set of all segments of rectified hyperbolic arc create an arithmetic progression cover of set of points on rectified hyperbolic curve. Finding a minimum size set of arithmetic progressions covering a set of integers is a hard problem. Previous rectification process for factorization solves a special case of arithmetic progression cover of a set. It has to be noted that finding an exact arithmetic progression cover of a set is the complement diophantine problem because the set of arithmetic progressions represents each of the diophantine subset in the exact cover partition. Known result in 700.1 implies covering a set by arithmetic progressions is NP-complete while the previous rectification for factorization solves this special case of arithmetic progression cover of set of rectified hyperbolic points in NC.This also implies complement diophantine problem is NP-complete for the special case of arithmetic progression diophantines for some partition of a set.

701.(THEORY) Category Theory formulation of EventNet - Objects, Morphisms, Functors - related to 582, 588, 654  - 21 August 2019, 22 September 2019, 29 October 2019,6 December 2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Category Theory of [Eilenberg-MacLane] abstracts whole of mathematics into following:
	701.1 Category C is a Set of Objects
	701.2 Every Category has set of morphisms f:a-b defined on objects a,b in Category C
	701.3 Functors F are maps between two Categories C1 and C2 - for each object x in C1, F(x) is in C2 and for each morphism f:a-b in C1
morphism, F(f):F(a)-F(b) is in C2

EventNet Tensor Products defined and implemented in NeuronRain and applied as intrinsic merit measure for large scale visuals can be formalised in terms of Category theory as follows:
	701.4 Every Event vertex in EventNet is a category
	701.5 Set of Actors in an Event Category are Objects of the Category
	701.6 Every intra-event interaction between any two actor objects a,b of an event category E is a Morphism - f:a-b
	701.7 Every inter-event causation between two Event Categories E1 and E2 (E1 causes E2) is a Functor - for each actor object x in E1, F(x) is in E2 and for each morphism f:a-b in E1, morphism F(f):F(a)-F(b) is in E2

As mentioned in previous sections on EventNet Tensor Product merit of Large Scale Visuals, EventNet Tensor formalizes logical time and causation. Rank of a Tensor T is the minimum number of Simple Tensors that sum to T where Simple Tensors are factorizable products of tensors. This implies Logical Time Tensor can be written as sum of products of Tensors implying seemingly linear 1-dimensional time is decomposable to tensor components basis. This has implications for physical sciences and experiments involving spacetime - Time could be multidimensional and any spatial object can be projected to any of the time tensor component axes similar to space. From previous Category Theory definition, EventNet Causality Functor Graph can also be written as sum of products of Tensors. Tensor Decomposition of Video EventNet Tensor yields component videos i.e video can be split into linearly independent component videos.

Another theoretical implication of EventNet is the possibility of retrocausality - effect causing the cause and arrow of time can be bidirectional. EventNet DAG can be partitioned into past, present and future disjoint subgraph components by 2 cuts/vertex separators. To preclude the possibility of retrocausality/time reversal, EventNet must be a directed acyclic graph devoid of loops and backedges (edges of right to left if Events flow left to right). If logical time is unidirectional (retrocausality is false) following "future" functions f1 and f2 defined on EventNet graph partition components (past,present,future) must be hard to invert implying one-way functions, Pseudorandom Generators and P != NP (left inverse does not exist for EventNet category):
	f1(past) = present
	f2(present) = future

Ramsey Theorem for Graphs implies any large graph G has a Ramsey number R(s,t) such that a graph G of R(s,t) vertices has an independent set of size s or a clique of size t. In the context of EventNet which is a huge causality graph, Ramsey Theorem implies there always exists a clique of mutually dependent events or mutually independent set of events in EventNet of R(s,t) vertices howsoever random the causality is.

702.(THEORY-FEATURE) Non-statistical Ontology Semantic Paths based Named Entity Recognition - related to 697 - 22 August 2019
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.A non-statistical WordNet Paths based Named Entity Recognition alternative was theoretically described earlier which exploits linguistic deep structure.
2.This alternative has been implemented in NamedEntityRecognition_HMMViterbi_CRF.py which works as below:
	2.1 find the semantic path between a PoS annotated word and unannotated adjacent word in an ontology e.g WordNet - path_between() from WordNetPath.py has been invoked (instead the text graph path between the words is also sufficient)
	2.2 for each vertex in the path find all possible PoS tags from WordNet Synsets which is a 2 dimensional list - Words * Set-of-PoS-per-Word
	2.3 find the cartesian product of the 2 dimensional list from 2.2 which enumerates all possible PoS paths between annotated and unannotated words - itertools product computes cartesian product of lists for all possible PoS paths which is a trellis
	2.4 aggregate the penultimate vertices in PoS paths
	2.5 find the majority PoS tag Synset of 2.4 which is the most likely PoS of the unannotated word
3.Logs in testlogs/NamedEntityRecognition_HMMViterbi_CRF.log.22August2019 demonstrate previous PoS paths majority voting for NER of an unannotated vertex.
4.Some paths between annotated and unannotated words drew blank because path_between() did not find a path
5.In some respects, previous algorithm resembles a transformer which is an attention model neural network scoring a sequence pipeline in transduction - it maps a sequence of words to sequence of PoS and attention context (important annotated words influencing an unannotated word) is provided by the PoS paths between PoS annotated and unannotated words in the word sequence.

703.(FEATURE) Text Graph of a natural languge text from ConceptNet 5.7 - implementation - 23 August 2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.NeuronRain text graph implementations so far rely only on WordNet for deciphering intrinsic deep structure merit of a text.
2.This commit implements ConceptNet 5.7 text graph alternative which was long pending.
3.New function conceptnet_text_graph() invokes least_common_ancestor graph creating function and aggregates edges from paths between all pairs of words.
4.ConceptNet5.7 Text Graph has been plotted by matplotlib at testlogs/ConceptNet5.7.TextGraph.23August2019
5.Logs for ConceptNet text graph creation are at testlogs/ConceptNet5Client.log.23August2019
6.Quality of Paths in ConceptNet is an open problem e.g https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07831 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
704.(FEATURE) ConceptNet 5.7 Text Graph - shortest path filter - 25 August 2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.ConceptNet 5.7 Text Graph implementation has been updated to find shortest paths from least common ancestor graph for each pair of
words in the text and merge the shortest paths to create the graph by NetworkX add_path()
2.This filtering improves the path quality to some extent.
3.Centrality measures and Dense Subgraph Classification (Core Numbers) are printed.
4.logs for this commit are at testlogs/ConceptNet5Client.log.25August2019

705.(FEATURE) ConceptNet 5.7 Text Graph - additional Graph Complexity Intrinsic Merit measures - 31 August 2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.ConceptNet 5.7 Text Graph implementation has been updated to print a comprehensive dictionary of graph complexity intrinsic merit
measures of the ConceptNet text graph similar to WordNet text graph in RecursiveLambdaFunctionGrowth implementation
2.grow_lambda_function3() in RecursiveLambdaFunctionGrowth python implementation has been changed to accept a textgraph as argument in the absence of a text and directly grow lambda functions from argument textgraph without creating it.
3.Text is read from a file ConceptNet5Client.txt and passed on as conceptnet textgraph function argument.
4.logs for this commit are at testlogs/ConceptNet5Client.log.31August2019
5.Special concept vertex '/c/en/\xb0_c' is in all the paths found by least common ancestor algorithm and therefore the graph has a hub-spoke star structure always. This node has been filtered by a new function remove_noise() to avoid star graphs. To increase path quality more vertices might be added whenever deemed necessary in remove_noise()
6.Exception handling for non-existent paths has been included.
7.Resulting filtered textgraph has been drawn in testlogs/ConceptNet5Client5.7.TextGraph.31August2019.png and is more like a sunflower (set of subsets of vertices having pairwise intersection forming petals).

706.(FEATURE) Recursive Lambda Function Growth - Machine Translation - updated implementation - 5 September 2019
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.machine_translation() function in RecursiveLambdaFunctionGrowth.py has been changed to create a summary text in the destination language
similar to create_summary()
2.As done in create_summary() summary translated text in target language is either created by traversing the textgraph or without traversing the textgraph
3.Presently translation creates only simple sentences. Complex sentences could be created in next iteration by compounding two neighbouring sentences.
4.Goslate and googletrans python libraries have been imported for translation because of frequent Invalid Word errors in PyDictionary()
5.Clauses specific to Goslate, googletrans and PyDictionary have been created along with exception handlers
6.Caveat is rate limitations of Google Translate REST API underlying all previous three translate libraries which might or might not work depending on load and requested time point.
7.If there are exceptions, source language edges are populated in translation text graph
8.logs for previous commit are at testlogs/RecursiveLambdaFunctionGrowth.log.MachineTranslation.5September2019 - because of Google translate REST API ratelimit translation textgraph could not be created
9.nondictionaryword() filter has been commented in RecursiveGlossOverlap Classifier because of slowdown.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
707.(FEATURE) Recursive Lambda Function Growth - Machine Translation - simplified - 6 September 2019
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.machine_translation() function in RecursiveLambdaFunctionGrowth.py has been simplified to remove unnecessary arguments and clauses and do the graph traversal and create summary in target language from it by default. This is because relevance_to_text() function which chooses sentences from text based on some distance measure to create summary is not necessary during translation
2.3 clauses for choice of translator - googletrans, goslate, PyDictionary - have been simplified to translate the connectives "and" and "are" to respective target language.
3.3 logs of translation for Hindi, Kannada and Telugu have been committed to testlogs:
	testlogs/RecursiveLambdaFunctionGrowth.log.Telugu.MachineTranslation.6September2019
	testlogs/RecursiveLambdaFunctionGrowth.log.Kannada.MachineTranslation.6September2019
	testlogs/RecursiveLambdaFunctionGrowth.log.Hindi.MachineTranslation.6September2019
4.Previous logs have some intermittent errors because of Google translate API ratelimit.
5.ConceptNet is an alternative to Google Translate which is a multilingual ontology.
5.Translated text printed has some weird words not relevant to the text subject because of encoding/decoding problems of the language fonts.
6.Normal english language summary of the text - from create_summary() - is also printed
7.Usual machine translations are rule based and recently transformers (sequence attention neural network) are gaining traction.Main motivation of NeuronRain is to implement an alternative, non-statistical, formal languages theory based framework for analyzing texts exploiting deep linguistic structure in them 
8.This formal languages focussed approach to measure merit of texts - NER, translation, extracting lambda expression from a text etc., is superior to inferring a neural network from text because text is approximated to a Turing machine indirectly by recursively grown lambda expressions which has strong cognitive psychology basis - Grounded Cognition - "phrasal structures are embedded recursively" 
9.As far as machine translation is concerned, instead of sequence transducers, text graph of one language is mapped to text graph of another language bijectively thus preserving deep structure and meaning irrespective of language - minimizes "lost in translation".

708. (FEATURE) Social Network Analysis - People Analytics - PIPL.com python API integration - Syllable based name clustering - 11 September 2019 and 14 September 2019
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.PIPL.com (people dot com) is a people search engine which tries to unqiuely identify a person based on name, email etc.,
2.PIPL.com python API have been imported in SocialNetworkAnalysis_PeopleAnalytics.py and invoked in a newly defined function pipldotcom_analytics() which has query parameters: first name, last name and email
3.pipldotcom_analytics() has been invoked on 3 example emails and names and JSON response is printed in logs at testlogs/SocialNetworkAnalysis_PeopleAnalytics.log.11September2019 which contains identities, photos, followers and relationships sourced from multiple social networks (linkedin, twitter, facebook, google, outlook etc.,)
4.Example email queries are: ka.shrinivaasan@gmail.com, shrinivas.kannan@gmail.com, kashrinivaasan@live.com for the name of the author - "Srinivasan Kannan"
5.Previous query is a perfect example of multiple english name spellings and online identities author has for the single Hindi/Tamizh/Sanskrit name of the author "Sri-Ni-Va-San": Shrinivas Kannan, Srinivasan Kannan, Shrinivaasan Kannan (Shrinivaasan Ka)
6.This multiple name spelling problem arises in English because of multiple alphabets per syllable (hyphenated previously) and could easily cause identity confusion while in Tamizh, Hindi and Sanskrit name syllables have single vowel+consonant compound alphabets
7.Finding and clustering similarly named people and proving their uniqueness is a challenge in BigData because of spelling conflicts in English for similarly pronounced names.
8.Syllable based (acoustic) linguistic clustering of names by hyphenation previously as opposed to edit distance based clustering is thus a good model to classify similar names of different spellings.
9.Apart from Syllables, the 3 name spellings in previous example have same meaning which requires a Name ontology (NameNet) for semantically relating names of same meaning.
10. Names are non-dictionary words and creating a NameNet could be exhaustive and daunting.

709. (FEATURE) Social Network Analysis - People Analytics - Contextual Name Parsing - 14 September 2019
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Name Parsing is an open problem and there are many tools already available (IBM Name Parser, Python Human Name Parser,...) 
2.In the context of People Analytics, it is often required to find the first name, second name, middle name, surname, last name etc., from full names in a BigData set and there are cultural barriers e.g some countries have convention of <second name> <first name> and others have <first name> <second name> and <second name> is initial,surname or name of the parent/spouse.
3.Because of cultural barriers across nations parsing first name or second name in the absence of some context (e.g. an ID card) is difficult and prone to error.
4.New function nameparser() has been defined in SocialNetworkAnalysis_PeopleAnalytics.py which accepts full name, a regular expression and an ID contextual text as arguments.
5.nameparser() searches for the regular expression pattern and the tokenized full name in the ID contextual text and tries to infer First Name and Second Name.
6.An example name parsing for the author and failure of Python Human Name Parser has been demonstrated - Some past forum mails of the author from https://marc.info/?a=104547613400001&r=1&w=2 and https://marc.info/?l=apache-modules&m=105610024116012 sent from official mail id: Kannan.Srinivasan@Sun.COM have wrong first (Kannan) and last (Srinivasan) names while final salutation in the emails contain the name per Indian convention as "K.Srinivasan" and Python Human Name parser fails to parse the names correctly in the absence of this context.
7.NeuronRain nameparser() defined in this commit is passed the email texts as contexts and the nameparser() searches for places in the emails containing the tokens of the full name by regular expression pattern. 
8.Following lines define two named regex patterns which are searched in the email ID contexts mentioned in (6) as per Indian Cultural Convention of Second Name or Initial followed by First Name:
hranal.nameparser("Kannan Srinivasan",r"(?P<second_name>\w+).(?P<first_name>\w+)",emailcontext_text)
hranal.nameparser("Kannan Srinivasan",r"(?P<second_name>\w+) (?P<first_name>\w+)",emailcontext_text)
9.nameparser() returns the regex groupdicts for the matched named-parentheses
10.nameparser() has been made generic to suit all kinds of regular expressions for names and ID contexts and can be invoked for any social or professional network names. ID Context could be text from any source (e.g emails, texts, ID card texts) and regex pattern argument must comply with the ID context - if Context argument is an ID card text having Name, Address and Parent Names, UniqueID etc., regex pattern must accordingly follow e.g "Parent Name:(?P<parent_name>\w+)"

710. (THEORY and FEATURE) Compressed Sensing for Texts - Syllable Vector Vowelless Text Compression - 18 September 2019 - Related to 2, 708
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Compressed Sensing which is mostly restricted to digital signal and image processing, reconstructs original signal from lossy signal with high probability.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed_sensing)
2.Vowelless Text Compression which compresses english texts by stripping vowels also creates a lossy compressed signal from which actual text has to be recovered with high probability and thus is a Text Compressed Sensing.
3.Existing Vowelless Text Compression implementation in neuronRain relies on Hidden Markov Model estimation to infer maximum likely missing vowels.
4.Syllables of a string in any language are phonetic divisions in the string.
5.Syllable boundary name clustering for clustering similar Names differing in spellings mentioned previously maps each string to a vector of syllables which is audio/linguistic representation of the string
6.Thus every n-syllable string irrespective of languages can be represented in an n-dimensional syllable space as a syllable vector and distance between two strings is the L2 norm in this syllable space - each syllable is phonetically represented than by a script. This is an alternative word2vec embedding model and is a better distance measure than levenshtein edit distance because of language script independence - 2 strings of different natural languages can be compared by phonetic syllable distance.
7.Syllable space embedding for similarity of names in NeuronRain is different from Phonetic Match Rating algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_rating_approach) which also removes vowels but does not consider syllable boundaries or hyphenations.
8.CompressedSensing Python implementation has been changed to include a new function syllable_boundary_text_compression() which invokes PyHyphen python hyphenator and gets syllable vector of a string and compressed syllable vector by removevowels() in TextCompression implementation.

1.Regex Pattern Matching in nameparser() has been changed to ignore case by flag re.IGNORECASE
2.Few more ID context texts are being regex matched in nameparser() which are parsed texts and OCRs (by pdftotext and gocr) from pdf and image IDs of the author uploaded in https://sourceforge.net/projects/acadpdrafts/files/?source=navbar - Public Distribution System ID card linked to Unique Aadhaar IDs and Permanent Account Number (PAN) which is Aadhaar linked - https://sourceforge.net/projects/acadpdrafts/files/NewRationCard2.pdf/download, https://sourceforge.net/projects/acadpdrafts/files/NewRationCard1.pdf/download and https://sourceforge.net/projects/acadpdrafts/files/PAN.jpg/download
3.These three ID cards are examples of Both Indian convention of Second name followed by First name and International standard of First name followed by Second name. https://sourceforge.net/projects/acadpdrafts/files/NewRationCard2.pdf/download, https://sourceforge.net/projects/acadpdrafts/files/NewRationCard1.pdf/download have Unique IDs linked to both formats but in different languages - Srinivasan Kannan கண்ணன சீனிவாசன
4.nameparser() is invoked on previous three ID contexts for full name "Kannan Srinivasan" and first and second names are printed
5.syllable_boundary_text_compression() from CompressedSensing implementation is invoked for 3 different spellings of same name "Shrinivaasan, Shrinivas, Srinivasan" and syllable vectors (and their vowelless versions) are printed:
==============================================================================
#####################################################################################################
Vowelless Syllable Vector Compression for text -  Shrinivaasan : ([u'Shrini', u'vaasan'], u'Shr_n_-v__s_n')
#####################################################################################################
Vowelless Syllable Vector Compression for text -  Shrinivas : ([u'Shrini', u'vas'], u'Shr_n_-v_s')
#####################################################################################################
Vowelless Syllable Vector Compression for text -  Srinivasan : ([u'Srini', u'vasan'], u'Sr_n_-v_s_n')
======================================================================
6.Distance between these syllable vectors has to be phonetic by finding syllable-wise audio similarity - every syllable is an audio waveform and two names are compared by syllable distances between vectors of waveforms e.g ["Shrini","vas"] and ["Srini","vasan"]. This has been omitted presently because syllable-to-audio tools are required.
7.Comparison to Match Rating Codex from JellyFish is also printed:

712. (THEORY) Computational Geometric Factorization - Gamma Approximation of Sum of Binary Search times - Summation for first sqrt(N) tiles and why non-average case sequential factorization is difficult - related to 668 - 19 September 2019
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For sane binary search length of the tile must be > 1 => N/(k^2 + k) > 1 (or) k^2 + k < N
=> k^2 + k - N < 0
=> solving the quadratic, k = -1 + sqrt(1 + 4N) / 2
=> k = -0.5 +/- 0.5*sqrt(1 + 4N)
For large N, k < 0.5*sqrt(4N) (or) k < sqrt(N)

Total time for binary searching k=sqrt(N) adjacent tile segment arithmetic progressions by gamma approximation = sqrt(N)log N - log (sqrt(N)+1) - (2sqrt(N) + 1)log(sqrt(N)) + 2(sqrt(N)+1) - log (2*pi)
= sqrt(N)logN + 2sqrt(N) + 2 - log(sqrt(N)+1) - 2sqrt(N)log(sqrt(N)) - log(sqrt(N)) - log(2*pi)
<= sqrt(N)logN + 2sqrt(N) + 2 - log(sqrt(N)) - 2sqrt(N)log(sqrt(N)) - log(sqrt(N)) -log(2*pi)
<= 2sqrt(N)log(sqrt(N)) + 2sqrt(N) + 2 - log(sqrt(N)) - 2sqrt(N)log(sqrt(N)) - log(sqrt(N)) - log(2*pi)
<= 2sqrt(N) + 2 - 2log(sqrt(N)) - log(2*pi)
<= 2*(sqrt(N) - log(sqrt(N)) + 1) - log(2*pi)
<= 2*(sqrt(N) - log(sqrt(N)))
which is exponential in logN still shaving off only a logarithm from squareroot of N. This necessitates finding approximate factors close to actual factors in average case sequential optimization previously implying factorization (finding atleast one factor) is in average-P which is an average lowerbound for all possible integers and different from P. Therefore deterministic factorization to find one factor or all factors requires NC (PRAM or BSP) parallelism - NeuronRain Spark Factorization which is both a PRAM (multicore) and BSP(cloud) model finds all factors. It has to be noted previous average case sequential time is for finding atleast one factor.

713. (THEORY and FEATURE) People Analytics - Set Partition based Electronic Voting Machine implementation and a NeuronRainApps Drone usecase - 24 September 2019 - related to 620,648
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Voter Received Encrypted Paper Audit Trail (VREPAT) Theoretical Voting Machine based on Set Partition Bucketing described previously is partially implemented as a futuristic drone usecase (Autonomous Delivery Usecases - https://syncedreview.com/2019/08/24/autonomous-delivery-moves-from-research-labs-to-the-streets/) in this commit - this is not a full-fledged implementation but conceptual:
	(*) Usual state-issued unique id(s) are singletons stored in centralized cloud and vulnerable to breaches/fakes creating identity disputes.
	(*) To redress this an alternative dual unique id (public id and private id) similar to public-key-infrastructure is assumed which is as strong as RSA and Diffie-Hellman protocols
	(*) Public unique id is a hash digest of a string which uniquely identifies a person e.g concatenation of <VoterID><Full Name><Parent/Spouse Name><Permanent Address> is always a unique public id. Private id is a password for a voter issued along with a Public unique id.
	(*) Polling Station is a Drone - it contains a set partition bucketing voting machine which based on addresses or public unique id(s) in the voter list automatically navigates to an address and lands on a voter doorstep. Voter casts h(is|er) vote on the drone booth by public unique id card and private password and receives encrypted receipt of vote.
	(*) This Dynamic Drone Polling Booth is inspired by Autonomous Online Shopping Delivery and Mobile ATMs available already (which work on smartcard and password authentication) and has many advantages over traditional static polling stations which satisfy constraints of John Hopkins Paper to some extent:
		(*) Voting need not be limited to a day and can sprawl multiple days.
		(*) Voter can do advanced booking for drone and it lands on demand making the voting behaviour difficult to predict.
		(*) All households are covered and thus maximizes polling percentage
		(*) Completely automated election - Minimizes or obviates polling stations, cost, queueing and personnel and thus human tamper-proof - requires one drone per polling precinct of few hundred voters
		(*) Ensures privacy
		(*) Reduces malpractices because of no crowding, each voter independently votes, polling happens at doorstep at time of choosing which is unpredictable and unique demographic/geographic identity is electronically verified by drone navigation to unique address minimizing bogus voting (no voter is denied voting because it could not have been already cast in h(is|er) name - GPS drone navigation is an additional geographic uniqueness). 
	(*) This commit defines a new minimal voting function electronic_voting_machine() in Streaming_SetPartitionAnalytics.py which accepts voted_for, example voter id card contexts of the author from testlogs/Streaming_SetPartitionAnalytics_EVM/ (no text parsing is done) and makes ripemd160 hash digests from them. EVM is a dictionary set partition object mapping candidate voted_for to list of voters' public uniqueid hash digests - does not use counters and private id authentication. 
	(*) Complexity theoretically, drone voting is reducible to Motion planning (A-Star algorithm) and travelling salesman problem (TSP) because drone has to efficiently navigate the voter vertices spread across geographically (e.g hamiltonian) and thus NP-complete.

714. (THEORY and FEATURE) Topological Handwriting Recognition - Product Homotopies - Related to 159,660 - 30 September 2019
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pattern grammars for shape description for handwriting recognition previously as homeomorphic deformations in R^2 preserving genus (also defined by knots - https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/Grafit/blob/master/course_material/NeuronRain/AdvancedComputerScienceAndMachineLearning/AdvancedComputerScienceAndMachineLearning.txt) have an alternative topological definition in terms of Product of Path Homotopy classes: Two paths f and f' are homotopic if they have same initial and final points x0 and x1 and there is a continuous map F:I * I ---> X for some topology space X such that F(s,0) = f(s) and F(s,1) = f'(s); F(0,t) = x0 and F(1,t) = x1. If f is a path in X from x0 to x1 of homotopy F and g is a path from x1 to x2 of homotopy G, product homotopy F*G by pasting lemma is the set of all continuous paths from x0 to x2 via x1. An example of product homotopy is handwritten digit '8' which has a pattern grammar:
	<8> := <o> pasted on <o>
Set of closed paths (all possible ways of writing 'o' - initial and end points are same) for <o> form a path homotopy F and product homotopy F*F defines all possible ways of writing '8' by pasting together endpoints of two handwriting homotopies F and F (also referred to as path composition). Similarly every handwritten alphabet can be defined as product of homotopies by pasting together path initial-end points. For example letter 'p' has pattern grammar: 
	<p> := <|> pasted to the left of <o>
In other words homotopy is a continous deformation of a path having end points fixed. It has to be noted that previous homotopy definition does not distinguish handwritings of two humans - it just recognizes any written alphanumeric as a product homotopy. Distinguishing two humans requires fine definition of homotopies within thresholds (e.g handwritings of same person hardly deviate from thresholds and some paths do not exist in handwriting homotopy of one person but do in other person's). This topological information of handwritings can complement traditional neural network based recognitions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Previous section defined Handwriting recognition topologically by Product Homotopies. Face Recognition and Handwriting recognition are crucial for unique identification of a human in people analytics. Extending Product Homotopies to Face Recognition is not straightforward because facial features are not continuous functions which can be unified by pasting lemma. Possible solution is to segment the image by either bounding boxes or watershed algorithm and find contours of facial features which are piecemeal discontinuous curves (approximable by Douglas-Peucker polynomial). Each bounding box or segment containing only continuous curves have to be unified by pasting lemma which define product homotopies of continuous deformations in 3-dimensions whereas handwriting homotopies are deformations in 2D. Example: set of images of all possible postures, expressions and facial distortions of a human face can be equated to union of product homotopies of continuous contour curves in bounding boxes or segments in the image - Contours of Eyes, Nose, Mouth and Ears of a face cannot be a single continuous curve and can be in separate segments or bounding boxes of an image each defined by a product homotopy of continuous contours. Union of product homotopies for Eyes, Nose, Mouth, Ears and any other feature recognizes a face including all possible facial deformations.

					  <Ear><Eye><Eye><Ear>

716. (THEORY and FEATURE) Economic Intrinsic Merit - Gravity Model of Volume of Trade and GDP as fitness measure - 2 October 2019
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Intrinsic Fitness or Intrinsic Merit has been traditionally applied to denote innate ability of a vertex in Social Networks. Fitness model is applicable in Economic Networks too e.g International Trading Network(ITN), Production Networks(https://economics.mit.edu/files/9790).
2.https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.6649.pdf discusses various measures of Economic fitness including GDP and quantifying volume of trade between nations - Quoted excerpts: 
	2.1 "...The standard model of non-zero trade flows, inferring the volume of bilateral trade between any two countries from the knowledge of their Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and mutual geographic distance (D), is the so-called ‘gravity model’ of trade [21–25]. In its simplest form, the gravity model predicts that the volume of trade between countries i and j is Fij = α GDP^βi · GDP^βj / Dij^k..."
	2.2 "...where zi ≡ e^−θi and pij ≡ zi*zj/(1+zi*zj). The latter represents the probability of forming a link between nodes i and j, which is also the expected value <aij>  = zi*zj/(1 + zi*zj)= pij . (4) ..."
	2.3 "...It should be noted that eq.(4) can be thought of as a particular case of the so-called Fitness Model [41], which is
a popular model of binary networks where the connection probability pij is assumed to be a function of the values of some ‘fitness’ characterizing each vertex. Indeed, the variables ~z∗ can be treated as fitness parameters [6, 37] which control the probability of forming a link. A very interesting correlation between a fitness parameter of a country (assigned by the model) and the GDP of the same country was found [37]. This relation is replicated here in Fig. 2, where the rescaled GDP of each country (gi ≡ GDPi/sum(GDPi)) is compared to the value of the fitness parameter z∗i obtained by solving eq.(5). The red line is a linear fit of the type zi = √a · gi...."
3. This commit defines a new function EconomicMerit() in LinearAndLogisticRegression.py which computes trade link probabilities and gravity model between countries based on GDP as intrinsic fitness measure and distances between countries. Reference 694.1 defines GDP fitness as a linear regression dependent on macroeconomic variables.

717. (THEORY) Cognitive Element in the context of Category theory, Factorization and Set Partitions - related to 160 - 4 October 2019
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notion of "Cognitive element" for the lack of better name was defined earlier as an element in an array, set partition, group, category or any algebraic structure which "knows" or has "information" about other peer elements - this is an experimental abstraction in Category theory which might have overlaps to existing algebraic concepts (left inverse of a morphism - retraction/section - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_(category_theory)). Information could be any equivalence relation or morphism - "member-of","factor-of","subset-of" etc., defined in a Category. Examples:
	717.1 117 = 13*9 is an element of ring of integers as category - 13,9 are "factors-of" 117 or 13 "knows" about 9 by factorization. Factorization is a morphism relation defined on category of integer objects - Inverse([13,9])=117
	717.2 Following set partition which maps timeout values to buckets of processes having that timeout value in an OS scheduler is a category(Hashing Dynamic Sets - https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/Grafit/blob/master/course_material/NeuronRain/AdvancedComputerScienceAndMachineLearning/AdvancedComputerScienceAndMachineLearning.txt):
		10 - 1,2,5
		20 - 12,15,11
		33 - 3,111
		41 - 16
		55 - 25,114
and every bucket defines a timeout morphism relation between objects in the processes category - Timeout Bucket 55 has processes 25, 114 which know each other.
	717.3 Every morphism equivalence relation on any Category defines equivalence classes elements of which have "information" about peers.
	717.4 Cognitive elements have useful applications in set partition equivalence relations - in previous set partition example, question of inverse - finding a bucket containing an element - is non-trivial e.g find the bucket having element 111. This requires an exhaustive search because set partition is not a bijective map and reverse lookup is not possible (but there are bidirectional dictionary implementations in Python which can retrieve a key from value - https://pypi.org/project/bidict/). Elements 3,111 are cognitive peers by inverse morphism relation "in the bucket of 33" - Inverse([111,3]) = 33. Implementing such an inverse requires knowledge of cognitive elements which are domains of the inverse morphism.

718. (THEORY and FEATURE) People Analytics - Set Partition Analytics based Drone Electronic Voting Machine - updated - 9 October 2019 - related to 713
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Streaming_SetPartitionAnalytics.py has been changed to update electronic_voting_machine() function - New semaphore mutual exclusion synchronized primitive block (BoundedSemaphore) has been added to guard the voting critical section. Maximum value of semaphore is set to 1 voter.
2.Voting code has been updated to check if voter has already voted by Voted list and skip voting if yes. Voter id(s) are appended to Voted array after voting within synchronized block.
3.Additional encryption has been introduced by invoking SHA256 Passlib encrypt on the ripemd160 publicuniqueid hex hash digest and append the encrypted voter id to EVM bucket.
4.This EVM assumes the function electronic_voting_machine() is invoked from a Drone python code which should have already navigated to the voter address and done the user/password authentication by smartcard.
5.Single Signon username/password authentication has already been implemented in NeuronRain GUI - python-src/webserver_rest_ui/NeuronRain_REST_WebServer.py - by passlib OAuth having MongoDB and Redis credential storage - which might as well be used as alternative caller for this EVM.
6.logs for preventing repetitive voting and SHA256 buckets are at testlogs/Streaming_SetPartitionAnalytics.EVM.log.9October2019
7.This Set Partition EVM is also a Dynamic Graph Partition (Similar Worst Case Execution Time - Survival Index - Dynamic Graph Partition OS Scheduler is described in https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/Grafit/blob/master/course_material/NeuronRain/AdvancedComputerScienceAndMachineLearning/AdvancedComputerScienceAndMachineLearning.txt - Hashing Dynamic Sets) because voting is dynamic and voters related among themselves might vote for different candidates which creates edges of dynamic people partition graph (voter vertices related by edges are partitioned into candidate buckets)
8.As mentioned in previous section, Left Inverse of Voter Bucket Objects is the Candidate voted for connecting peer voters by an equivalence relation.

719. (THEORY) Complement Diophantines over Integers (Z), Polynomial Interpolation, Polynomial Reconstruction Problem, Error Correcting Codes, MRDP theorem, Lagranges Four Square Theorem and Decidability of Complementation, Ramsey 2-coloring of sequences, Set Partitions to Tile Cover reduction, Factorization, Lagrangian tiling of 2-dimensional space, ZF and Axiom of Choice (AOC) and Complement Choice functions, Depth-2 majority voting social choice circuits - an alternative interpretation based on diagonalization - 13 October 2019 - related to 345, 471, 617, 646, 651, 657
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By MRDP theorem, every recursively enumerable (RE) set of Integers is diophantine representable and there are RE sets which are not recursive (R) = RE \ R (RE set difference R). RE \ R languages have diophantine representations but are not accepted/rejected by a halting turing machine (without looping) which includes a turing machine for finding the complement diophantine representation of a language in RE \ R. Such a halting turing machine (TM1) in RE \ R or an algorithmic equivalent for finding complement diophantine representation of other sets in RE \ R is a contradiction. This diagonalization proves undecidability of complement diophantine for RE \ R (diophantine representation exists but algorithm does not for RE \ R).

For Recursive sets (R), there are algorithms available or there exists a halting turing machine (TM2) in R for finding algorithmic equivalent of diophantine representation of other sets in R and diagonalization does not contradict e.g Polynomial Interpolation (exact), Polynomial Reconstruction Problem (error correcting polynomial agreeing on most points - reference 345.2), Lagrange four square theorem. Lagrange four squre theorem maps tuples in 4-dimensional space to points on recursive set (or) any integer can be written as sum of 4 squares. This 4-tuples to integer map from Lagrange four square theorem is infact an interpolation by a polynomial over 4 variables - f(x1,x2,x3,x4) = x1^2 + x2^2 + x3^2 + x4^2 = y. Lagrange Four Square interpolation indirectly solves factorization by solving an optimization problem - set partition is reduced to tile cover of a rectangular 2-dimensional space and factors are sides of the rectangle which have to be solved for by an integer program.(Both diophantine representation and algorithm exist for R). Chinese Remainder Theorem generalizes this as an isomorphic map in multiple dimensions - x mod N <=> (x mod n1, ..., x mod nk) for coprime n1,n2,...,nk and N=n1*n2*...*nk. 

This diagonal interpretation is more dichotomous than previous sections on complement diophantine undecidability which in a nutshell implies: Any set is a complementary set of some other set and thus any complementary set which is recursively enumerable but not recursive has a diophantine representation and not decidable by an algorithm, while any recursive complementary set is decidable by an algorithm and also has a diophantine representation.

As a special example complement of Axiom of Choice for depth-2 majoriy boolean circuits is phrased as: For set of electorate sets S={s1,s2,s3,...} there exists a choice function C'(si)=(x1,x2...) which flips a chosen majority (0 or 1) from every set si in S. Leaves are members of S (electorate sets or constituencies) while depth-1 are complemented/flipped bits from majority voting of leaves. This complements AOC democracy function as: "Who won" Vs "Who lost" (alternatively can be complemented as "Who voted in favour" versus "Who did not vote in favour" which has hardness amplification ramifications for proving P != NP). It is open if Complement AOC is decidable. Traditional democracy is depth-2 majority circuit and abides by AOC.

Complement Diophantines throughout this draft focus mainly on sets or sequences of Integers (Z) because MRDP theorem and Rayleigh-Beatty  sequences theorem are limited to Z while complementation over Rationals(Q) is open problem and complementation over Reals (R) is solvable by Tarski/Sturm decidability.

720. (THEORY and FEATURE) People Analytics - Handwriting Recognition - Contour Homotopies - Matplotlib Rasterization - 16 October 2019 - related to 714 and 715
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.This commit updates handwriting_recognition() in DeepLearning_ConvolutionNetwork_BackPropagation.py to additionally raster the contours extracted from the handwritten alphanumeric.
2.Rasterization presently invokes matplotlib plot() having parameter rasterized=True and presets dots-per-inch parameter to 100 in figure() for restricting number of pixels.
3.Contours from each recognized written alphanumeric are looped and plotted by matplotlib plot() setting rasterized=True.
4.There are better alternatives to this primitive rastering - rasterio (https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and wavelet-rasterization (https://github.com/ufoym/wavelet-rasterization/) and desired rasterization is similar to illustrations in https://github.com/ufoym/wavelet-rasterization which is a coarse rectification required for hyperbolic arc in Computational Geometric Factorization (But there is a windows DLL build dependency). Matplotlib dots-per-inch and rasterized=True creates fine grained rasterized curves.
5.Each contour is approximable by a Bezier-like curve (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve) which is an instance of homotopy because bezier curves have endpoints/control points unchanged and intermediate points on curve are puppet-animated (most applicable in Graphics). 
6.Handwriting can be simulated by a Bezier curve having unchanged endpoints or control points which is a homotopic continuous deformation.
7.Original handwriting is reconstructible by homotopy and pasting lemma - by pasting together polynomials for individual contours.

9.Every contour can be fit to a bezier polynomial and two alphanumerics have to be verified if they are homotopic (has a dependency on topology libraries). This is non-trivial because every homotopically "similar" contour in two alphanumerics have to be pairwise compared
and number of contours per alphanumeric could be in hundreds.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.In continuation of the previous commit for drawing rasterized contour curves, handwriting contours are interpolated by SciPy.interpolate splprep()
2.Points on contour curves are stack()-ed to 2 dimensional arrays and contours having more than 3 points are interpolated by spline polynomials of degree less than number of points per contour.
3.PdfPages "pdf damaged" error in DeepLearning_ConvolutionNetwork_BackPropagation.Raster.Homotopies.pdf has been resolved by PdfPages close() which flushes the buffer.
4.splprep (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-1.2.1/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.splprep.html) creates B-Spline curves which are exact but less smooth as opposed to Bezier curves which are smoother, depend on control points and are approximate fit (passes through most of the points).
5.Boolean flag TopologicalRecognition=True/False has been introduced in __main__ to choose topological handwriting recognition instead of Convolution Neural Network Pattern Recognition.
6.Logs and Pdf images for contour polynomials are at:
testlogs/DeepLearning_ConvolutionNetwork_BackPropagation.log.17October2019
testlogs/DeepLearning_ConvolutionNetwork_BackPropagation.Raster.Homotopies.pdf
7.By defining an inner product space of contour polynomials <f,g>=DefiniteIntegral(f(x)g(x)dx), distance function is obtained for verifying if 2 contours belonging to different handwritten alphanumerics are "similar" or "orthogonal" (polynomials f and g are orthogonal if <f,g>=0). This is an algebraic but less topological similarity.

724.1 electronic_voting_machine() function in Streaming_SetPartitionAnalytics.py has been updated to accept 3 arguments - voting machine set-partition obfuscated dictionary, unique id context and candidate voted for - for removing hardcoded voting dictionary and being generic across polling stations.
724.2 Voting machine dictionaries are iterated and mapped to histograms of Candidate to Votes Counter (size of bucket)
724.3 Voting machine dictionaries are JSON dumped to a file testlogs/Streaming_SetPartitionAnalytics.EVMs.json - this JSON persistence is only for analytics purposes and voting machine dictionary is still an in-memory object per drone EVM supposed to be passed on from an already navigated Drone python code which is lacking.
724.4 This JSON file can be read as a stream by Streaming Abstract Generator Dictionary datasource -Streaming_AbstractGenerator.StreamAbsGen("DictionaryHistogramPartition","testlogs/Streaming_SetPartitionAnalytics.EVMs.json") and any histogram analytics function can be invoked on the stream.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Drone Electronic Voting Machine partial implementation previously is only a majority voting simulation - Voted dictionary hardcoded at present which prevents duplicate voting in Streaming_SetPartitionAnalytics.py (if publicuniqueid not in Voted:) has to be either in a centralized NoSQL store or localized per drone for global uniqueness so that no voter casts vote in 2 drone EVMs (which is already guaranteed by geographic uniqueness - drone autonomously navigates to an address and authenticates voter smartcard by point-of-voting device - in some aspects this is similar to old tech postoffice protocol and a betterment of postal ballots: Sealed paper mails are delivered uniquely to a name and address which is a public unique id and there is no password. Tampering is easily verifiable if there is damage to courier seal) - Localized Voted dictionary requires voter lists per drone. Clustering of EVM Set partitions by either Earth Mover Distance or other aforementioned distance measures in OpenCV2 classifies EVMs of similar voting patterns in single cluster (non-invasive because histogram depends on per candidate counters alone). This clustering of EVMs corresponds to depth-1 of depth-2 non-boolean Majority Voting Circuit described schematically in 657 and reflects per segment trend. In boolean setting, empirically EVMs might be clustered into 2 disjoint partitions for candidates 0 and 1. It has to be noted that set partition of votes is available only post-poll while prepoll numbers are only total votes - inferring post-poll votes set partition from pre-poll total votes is reducible to function:
	f(n) = c1 + c2 + ... + ck (n votes partitioned to k candidates)
and has probability 1/p(n,k) where p(n,k) is restricted partition number of n for k parts - restricted partition and money changing problem/coin problem are equivalent. Probability of candidate of biggest part (c0) being always ahead in counting by Bertrand Ballot theorem is c0-c1/(c0+c1) if f(n) = c0 + c1 in boolean majority for candidates 0 and 1.

727. (THEORY) Fame-Merit Equilibrium and Converging Markov Random Walk on World Wide Web, Condorcet Jury Theorem, Bipartite Decomposition of World Wide Web, Margulis-Ruzzo Threshold - Conjecture - 12 November 2019 - related to 572 and all sections on Intrinsic Merit, Fame and Majority Voting
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
727.1 Page Rank is a converging markov random walk based Fame ranking for World Wide Web and is a peer-to-peer markov chain voting mechanism.
727.2 Fame-Merit Equilibrium mentioned theoretically earlier, is an alternative reputation ranking which tries to find an equilibrium approximation point between absolute intrinsic merit and perceived fame of an entity.
727.3 Both Fame-Merit Equilibrium and PageRank are based on directed graph having weighted edges between perceived and perceiver vertices and thus are two formats of Condorcet Jury Theorem and its derivatives([Black],[KKLadha]) or Margulis-Ruzzo Threshold for boolean majority CJT (Voters or Perceivers err in judging intrinsic merit of the perceived and error probability tilts the group decision either way beyond a threshold) - mistake-minimized infinite voters/jury implies Nash equilibrium is attainable in either variants of reputation rankings - PageRank and Fame-Merit equilibrium are two sides of Condorcet Jury Theorem Coin.
727.4 Fame-Merit equilibrium in the context of algorithmic economics finds Market Clearing Prices for commodities (which are between intrinsic and perceived prices) by Convex Programs and is schematically drawn as bipartite graph of edges between two sets of vertices - Perceivers(Buyers) and Perceived(Items). Every perceiver has a total disposable price merit which has to be apportioned amongst perceived items by the convex program (Eisenberg-Gale, Fischer, Nash Equilibria). Similar equilibria can be found for any Perception-Absolute (Fame-Merit) problem irrespective of entity being judged - Fame is an image possibly distorted while Merit is real.
727.5 PageRank finds ranking of an entity by a converging markov random walk on peer-to-peer world-wide-web weighted directed graph of Perceiver-Perceived (huge graph of few billion vertices)
727.6 Equating PageRank and Fame-Merit equilibrium is of theoretical importance because the two are different mathematical gadgets - convex program and converging markov chain random walk.
727.7 Fame-Merit equilibrium convex program for world wide web should also be a huge bipartite graph of few billion perceivers and perceived on the internet.
727.8 Solutions to Fame-Merit equilibrium convex program strike an approximate midpoint between absolute intrinsic merit and perceived fame.
727.9 Natural question begotten by equating rankings from fame-merit convex program and PageRank markov chain is: Are two rankings equivalent? Answer to this question is conjectured as yes in 727.3 supra. Proof/Disproof of this conjecture might involve equating a generic convex program for a huge bipartite graph of p perceivers and q perceived vertices and PageRank of the same graph of p+q vertices. Or Nash equilibria have to be found for both Fame-Merit and PageRank and checked for equality.
727.10 High Correlation coefficients between the two rankings prima facie might indicate coincidence. Challenge is to conceive the world-wide web as a whole to be a bipartite graph of perceivers-perceived though some components of the internet might be bipartite -  this might require algorithms for bipartite decomposition - world wide web directed graph is decomposed to bipartite subgraph components and fame-merit equilibrium is computed for each bipartisan component.

But actual scenario mostly is the inequality of demand and supply (Demand-Supply curves - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand) defined by equation Demand * Supply = constant (Demand is inversely proportional to Supply). Demand is also a perception and can be defined as perceived importance or utility of a commodity and thus a function of perception/utility: 
	utility = function_of(demand) or function_of(1/supply)
Glut of any entity diminishes perceived importance and dearth increases it. Demand-Supply equilibrium can be generalized to any entity - text,audio,video,people - merit of which has to be judged e.g rare texts are more valued, rare visuals are more sought after,rare earths are costly.

728. (THEORY and FEATURE) Set Partition to Tile Cover Reduction by Computational Geometric Factorization - Least Squares Approximate Solution
for the underdetermined linear equations, Exact Money Changing Problem(MCP) Solution, Quadratic Programs, Pell Equation, Shell Turing Machines(Category of Topological Spaces) - related to 577,624,651 - 19 November 2019, 20 November 2019,6 December 2019, 24 January 2020, 26 January 2020, 27 January 2020
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.A random set is partitioned by SymPy set partition API and a partition of the set is chosen at random. Random set partition is mapped to a
histogram by map(len,) and setpartition_to_tilecover() is invoked. New parameter for number to factorize has been added in setpartition_to_tilecover().
2.An integer is factorized by Spark Computational Geometric PRAM factorization by subprocess.call() invocation and factors of N=pq are read from JSON persistence.
3.Following underdetermined system of equations is solved approximately by LSMR least squares for finding arrangement of tiles on the periphery of the rectangle and the fractional solution vector is rounded off to 1 or 0 based on a threshold:
	#c1*x1 + c2*x2 + ... + ck*xk + ... + cn*xn = p
	#d1*x1 + d2*x2 + ... + dk*xk + ... + dn*xn = q
	#solve AX=B:
	#X = [c1 c2 ... cn] - unknowns (boolean include or exclude of a tile)
	#A = [[x1 x2 ... xn]  - knowns (sides of the square tiles)
	#     permutation_of[x1 x2 ... xn]]
	#B = [p q] - factors - pq=N
4.Solving underdetermined equations by most libraries including SciPy, NumPy, SymPy etc., yield only approximate solutions because of Rouche-Capelli theorem limitation. In the previous system of equations coefficient matrix A has two rows of square tile sides from Lagrange four square theorem and one of the rows is permuted for randomness (reverse() is invoked) and unknown tile choice vector (d1,d2,...,dn) should also be  some permutation of (c1,c2,...,cn).
5.This commit approximately solves the previous underdetermined linear equations by lsmr() function of scipy.sparse.linalg and rounds the real solution vector to binary vector. Mutual exclusion of tiles is by an if-else clause which chooses 1 tiles for side1 and 0 tiles for side2 of rectangle. But product of sum of sides won't be equalling N always because of error allowed in LSMR and rounding. Sophisticated PRAM GEPP implementations might do better at finding the tile arrangment vector (c1,c2,...,cn)
6.logs for this commit are at testlogs/Streaming_SetPartitionAnalytics.log.19November2019
7.An example Lagranges Four Square reduction for integer 18 and its random partition=[4,10,4]:
		18 <=> [4,10,4] <=> [1+1+1+1]+[1+4+4+1]+[1+1+1+1] 
		18 <=> 2*9 <=> Solutions for previous tile arrangement system of equations for the rectangle periphery: [1+1]*[2+2+1+1+1+1+1]
8.Each of the two linear equations can be interpreted as instance of Money Changing Problem(MCP) or Coin Problem. Sides of the square tiles are coins and following linear system:
	c1*x1 + c2*x2 + ... + ck*xk + ... + cn*xn = p 
	d1*x1 + d2*x2 + ... + dk*xk + ... + dn*xn = q
equates factors of N=(p,q) to Linear Sum of sides of lagrangian square tiles (1-dimensional) for the length and breadth of rectangular periphery. Both of the earlier MCP equations are NP-Hard (Strongly or Weakly depending on encoding) which involves finding the integer vector [c1,c2,c3,...,cn]. Equivalently, tile cover of the rectangle is the linear sum of lagrangian squares (coins are 2-dimensional lagrangian tiles themselves) and is a 2-dimensional Money Changing Problem which is again NP-Hard. Product of the equations is a Quadratic Program which is also NP-Hard. Solution vector [c1,c2,c3,...,cn] is the set of number of tiles for each lagrangian tile square.MCP solves the tile arrangement in exact non-deterministic polynomial time while LSMR least squares is a deterministic polynomial time approximation. An example greedy algorithm for minimum coins change problem is described in GRAFIT course material repository: https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/Grafit/blob/master/course_material/NeuronRain/AdvancedComputerScienceAndMachineLearning/AdvancedComputerScienceAndMachineLearning.txt
9. Lagrangian Four Square reduction of a set partition to sum of squares can be equated to Pell Equation written in terms of factors of N=pq:
	integer or set partition of N = pq = n1^2 + n2^2 + n3^2 + ... + nk^2 = x^2 - y^2 = for x=(p+q)/2 and y=(p-q/2)
which in effect shatters or demolishes an one-dimensional set to a set of k 2-dimensional square tiles and equates the sum of squares to difference of two squares.
10. Shell Turing Machines defined in this draft can be formalized by Category Theory: Category S has various topological spaces of arbitrary dimensions as objects and morphisms are Conduit Turing Machines amongst these object spaces which act as linear transformations between one space to the other. Lagrangian set partition to tile cover reduction is an instance of such a Category of Topological Spaces (TOP) - For objects S1 and S2 in S, set partition defined in an one dimensional space S1 is lifted to a 2 dimensional space of square tiles S2 by Lagrange Four Square Conduit Turing Machine Morphism between object spaces S1 and S2. Application of Shell Turing Machines to previous reduction is unusual (NeuronRain Documentation,FAQ and Licensing: http://neuronrain-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ mentions some references on TOP). Thus Shell Turing Machines (Category of Topological Spaces) perform a kind of kernel lifting - Lagrangian Tiling Conduit Turing Machines are the kernels
11. Nomenclature "Shell Turing Machines" is thus a universal mathematical abstraction which connects vector space embedding of alphabets and states transitions of Turing Machine and transformation of truth values of logical statements between spaces in many fields of STEM:
	11.1 Hilbert Space Quantum Computation Machines - States and Alphabets of Quantum Turing Machine are embedded in a Hilbert Space (Section 624)
	11.2 Linear Machines of Category theory - [Eilenberg-Maclane] - Categories (Objects,Morphisms,Functors) are embedded in a vector space (Conceptual graph of NeuronRain theory drafts - http://neuronrain-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
	11.3 Kernel Lifting in Support Vector Machines - dataset in smaller dimensional space S1 is lifted to a higher dimensional space S2 by a kernel (e.g Mercer polynomial kernel - https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/Grafit/blob/master/course_material/ComputerScienceMiscellaneous/ComputerScienceMiscellaneous_CourseNotes.txt) and decision hyperplane classifier is found in S2
	11.4 Set Partition to Lagrange Tile Cover reduction - lifts an one dimensional set partition to a 2 dimensional square tile cover of a rectangle by Lagrange Four Square Theorem (sides of rectangle are found by Computational Geometric Factorization)
	11.5 Word Embedding of datasets in Machine Learning
	11.6 Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) - functions (Turing machines) are embedded on a metric space and distance is defined between functions (Section 624).
	11.7 Category of Topological Spaces - TOP - abstracts all the previous embeddings and lifting by defining topological spaces (e.g datasets embedded on vector space) as objects of category and morphisms amongst them. Morphisms between topological spaces are Conduit Turing Machines formalized by any of the previous computation models which lift data and truth values of logical statements between spaces - Linear Machines, RKHS, linear transformations, kernels, Lagranges four squares theorem, Word embedding. Examples:
		11.7.1 TOP category T has two space objects S1 and S2. Conduit Turing Machine morphisms are defined between S1 and S2. Logical statement Biggest() which finds maximum of points in a toplogical space thus has two truth values in S1 and S2 - Biggest(S1) and Biggest(S2) - which might have to be teleported between spaces. 
		11.7.2 Another Good software engineering example of such lifting is the Unix Shell Category where object shells are arbitrarily created and environment variables are privy to a shell object unless otherwise communicated explicitly by EXPORT which acts as a Conduit Turing Machine Morphism between object shells. Outermost shell is the Root and a tree hierarchy of recursively created subshells forms a nested category of shell objects - S1 and S2 are two shell objects in this Shell Category theoretically embedded in some topological space, and EXPORT morphism EXPORT: S1 <=> S2 is a Conduit Turing Machine which exports environment variables of S1 embedded in space X and S2 embedded in space Y bijectively between S1 and S2 except Outermost shell which is unidirectional (because nothing needs to be lifted out of outermost Shell but only to subshells). Cutting across operating systems, such a Shell mechanism and EXPORT morphism has been universally implemented not just limited to Unix - any computation in STEM (Science-Technology-Engineering-Mathematics) is on some OS which has shell TOP category implementation.
		11.7.3 Shell Turing Machines Category of Topological Spaces can be formulated as a space filling problem - Category of hierarchically nested topological space shells are embedded in and cover the outermost n-dimensional Shell topological space (Outermost n-sphere) and EXPORT morphisms are defined amongst these shell spaces. For 3-dimensions, this is akin to filling an Outermost spherical bubble container shell by smaller nested spherical shell bubbles which is a 3-dimensional variant of Apollonian Gasket.
	11.8 Turing Degree is the equivalence class of Turing machines solving sets of similar difficulty. Turing Jump A' of A is the set of Turing machines which halt having oracle access to A or set of problems harder than A. Previous Conduit Turing Machine morphisms in TOP abstraction define a Turing Jump between topological spaces of different Turing degree difficulties e.g Conduit Turing Machine Morphism might have an oracle access to a Turing machine defined in a domain topological space of lower Turing Degree lifting to a range topological space of higher Turing Degree. Every computation in STEM can be abstracted as Category of Topological Spaces and Turing Degree Hieararchy can be defined on them e.g Computational Physics problems in Relativity, Quantum mechanics and String theory involving theoretical abstractions for microcosm and macrocosm.

1.This commit implements the Betrand Ballot Theorem - probability p-q/p+q that one of the candidate might win of two rival candidates getting p and q votes respectively during the process of counting - as a live election analytics measure within electronic_voting_machine() function of Streaming_SetPartitionAnalytics.py
2.It assumes live counting of voting - votes are immediately counted after they are cast - is allowed as against deferred counting convention usually followed in elections because secrecy might be compromised.
3.But this measure is also useful for post-poll analytics during the process of counting itself for extrapolating the result - before election is called.
4.Random Majority voting is simulated on 3 fictitious candidates and probabilistic trend is printed while voting is underway.
5.logs are at testlogs/Streaming_SetPartitionAnalytics.EVM.log.28November2019
6.This measure applies only to binary election of 2 candidates - EVM dictionary is sorted and votes of top 2 rivals are compared dynamically (after each vote is cast), to print the Bertrand probability.

732. (FEATURE and THEORY) Merit of Large Scale Visuals - Tensor Rank intrinsic merit of EventNet of a video - 7 December 2019 - related to 588
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.This commit upgrades ImageGraph_Keras_Theano.py to Python 3.6 from Python 2.7 and computes Tensor Rank of EventNet of a video by tensorly python library (tensorly requires Python 3) - autopep8 and 2to3 tools have been used for upgrade. Python 3.6 is many orders of magnitude faster than Python 2.7 and EventNet Tensor Product and Tensor Rank is computationally intensive which needs faster Python.
2.Following dependent files have been upgraded to Python 3.6 by two tools - autopep8 and 2to3 - which correct formatting issues to comply with PEP8 and convert a file written in python 2.7 to python 3.6 (Python 2.7 versions have been committed having .2.7 suffix):
	2.1 RecursiveGlossOverlap_Classifier.py 
	2.2 WordNetPath.py
	2.3 ImageGraph_Keras_Theano.py
3.Note: all python 2.7 source files in NeuronRain can be upgraded to Python 3.6 in two simple steps for better performance:
	3.1 Execute autopep8 on the file for PEP8
	3.2 Execute 2to3-2.7 on PEP8 formatted file
4.ImageGraph_Keras_Theano.py - videograph_eventnet_tensor_product() has been modified for preprocessing (slicing 100*100 square) the tensor product of video EventNet and tensorly non_negative_parafac() is invoked which decomposes the video EventNet tensor.
5.logs have been committed to testlogs/ImageGraph_Keras_Theano.log.TensorRank1Decomposition.7December2019
6.Video EventNet Tensor is printed for debug purposes
7.Rank-1 tensor factors from non_negative_parafac() of Video EventNet Tensor are also printed

733. (FEATURE and THEORY) Computational Geometric Factorization - Quadcore Python 3.6 Upgrade Benchmarks - 11 December 2019 - related to all
sections of Factorization
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.This commit upgrades Spark Python Computational Geometric Factorization implementation DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized.py from Python 2.7 to Python 3.6 for performance and availing the better range() utility in Python 3.x which breaches the maximum range barrier limitation in Python 2.7. Python 3.6 range() is a rewrite and supports huge integers (of hundreds of digits).
2.Following Spark Python environment variables have been set to Python 3.6m binary for PySpark upgrade to Python 3.6:
	SPARK_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3.6m
	SPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3.6m
3.Large Integer 999999999999999999 (60 bits) has been factorized which is by far the largest integer factorized in Spark BSP-NC-PRAM model. Larger integers throw a Spark Python error in PySpark context.py (File "spark-2.4.3-bin-hadoop2.7/python/lib/pyspark.zip/pyspark/context.py", line 501, in parallelize, OverflowError: Python int too large to convert to C ssize_t):
	if isinstance(c, xrange):
            size = len(c)
because of len() failure for larger integers
[
Error can also be produced from commandline:
>>> x=range(9999999999999999999)
>>> len(x)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
OverflowError: Python int too large to convert to C ssize_t
>>> x=range(999999999999999999)
>>> len(x)
999999999999999999
]
4.Previous error requires Spark rewrite of context.py parallelize() to:
	range().stop - range().start 
replacing len() specific to Python 3.x range()
5.Python 2.7 Spark Factorization implementation has been upgraded to Python 3.6 by autopep8 followed by 2to3-2.7 utilities. Python 2.7 version has been marked as DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized.py.2.7
6.Spark Python version is printed by sys.version:
	Spark Python version: 3.6.8 (default, Oct  7 2019, 12:59:55) 
	[GCC 8.3.0]
7.First few factors of 999999999999999999 are printed to testlogs/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized.Python3.6Upgrade.11December2019. Timestamp of each factor is printed.
8.Ray shooting queries excluding Hardy-Ramanujan and some imports have been commented.

734. (FEATURE) Merit of Large Scale Visuals - Video EventNet Tensor Decomposition to Rank-1 Tensors on Python 3.7.5 - slicing - 12 December 2019
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.ImageNet_Keras_Theano.py videograph_eventnet_tensor_product() has been changed to accept side of square slice per frame as an argument which is by default 100*100 pixels.
2.Square slicing per frame is necessary when elements of video tensor product matrix are of unequal rectangular dimensions and tensorly stipulates equal dimensions.
3.Usual videos have frames of equal dimensions but the example montage video footage in NeuronRain has unequal frame sizes and minimum frame sides have to be found which are then used to slice each frame. 
4.Since a video can have arbitrarily large number of frames in millions, finding the minimum sides of the frame rectangles could be daunting.
5.Instead of finding minimum frame sides, square slicing has been made default and configurable by user in function argument "squareslice" which is by default 100.
6.Python 3.6.8 for TensorLy has been upgraded to Python 3.7.5 which is the fastest python distribution.

735. (THEORY and FEATURE) Complement Diophantines - Least Squares Vandermonde Polynomial Fit Learning - related to all sections on 
Complement Diophantines - Python 3.7.5 upgrade - 14 December 2019
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. complement.py complement diophantine learner has been updated to learn a degree 5 interpolated polynomial for a complementary set (non-squares)
2. polyfit() from numeric python has been invoked on a complementary set of non-squares (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.polyfit.html) which is a least squares solution solver for Vandermonde coefficient matrix
3. polyfit() least square interpolation is an alternative to Lagrangian polynomial interpolation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_polynomial) mentioned in arXiv version (https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.4102v1, https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eLZY7CIAAAAJ&hl=en).
4. complement.py has been upgraded to Python 3.7.5 from Python 2.7 by autopep8 and 2to3 utilities. Python 2.7 version has been suffixed as .2.7
5. polyfit() least square interpolation is guaranteed to be unique - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_interpolation
6. logs for polyfit() are committed to testlogs/complement.PolyFitPython3.7.5.14December2019
7. Least Squares and Lagrangian interpolations are total functions while Lagrange Four Square Theorem complement map is a partial function (not all domain tuples are mapped to a point in complementary set)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
736. (THEORY and FEATURE) Computational Geometric PRAM-NC-BSP Factorization - Python 3.7.5 upgrade - Spark Quadcore benchmarks - 512 bit integer - related to 477,481 and all other sections on Factorization - 18 December 2019
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Computational Geometric Factorization Python-Spark implementation has been upgraded to Python 3.7.5 and following local tile search algorithm mentioned in 477 and 481 has been implemented which obviates parallel sorting and completely removes the maximum integer barrier altogether:

while(iterations <= O((logN)^k))
{
	*) Assign N/(logN)^k tiles to N/(logN)^k PRAMs in parallel (O(1) parallel time because each interval tile in a global shared memory array can be accessed by PRAM id as index)
	*) Binary Search tile in each PRAM for factors (O(logN) parallel time which can be reduced to O(logN/logp) by parallel binary search from Snir's Theorem)
}

2.Number of PRAMs (multicores) is 4 and constant k in (logN)^k has been set to 50 which, though not commensurate, is hardcoded for demonstrative reasons. Previous algorithm is work optimal NC because PRAM time * iterations = Sequential time
3.Spark context parallelize() has been refactored to following loop which circumvents the Spark context ssize_t exception in pyspark context.py parallelize() - maximum value of len() is limited to 64 bits per slice by suitable choice of exponent k:
        normal_order_n = int(math.pow(math.log(n, 2),50))
        tiles_start = 1
        tiles_end = int(n/normal_order_n)
        for x in range(normal_order_n):
            print("tiles_start:", tiles_start)
            print("tiles_end:", tiles_end)
            tiles = range(tiles_start, tiles_end)
            print(("len(tiles):", len(tiles)))
            spcon.parallelize(tiles).foreach(
                tilesearch_nonpersistent)
            tiles_start = tiles_end
            tiles_end += int(n/normal_order_n)
Previous loop of (logN)^k iterations slices the Python 3.7.5 range() into multiples of N/(logN)^k and individually parallelizes each slice to RDDs.
4.Because Python 3.7.5 range() is unlimited, maximum number factorizable is arbitrary for all practical purposes - previous benchmark for 60 bits has been bettered and a huge integer of 512 bits which is ecommerce-grade - 9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 - has been factorized to print all factors on single node cluster of 4 multicores. This is the largest integer factorized thus far. Smoothness of this integer (high omega and large number of small prime factors) causes easy factorization.
5.logs at testlogs/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized.Python3.7.5Upgrade.512bits.18December2019 print a truncated list of factors of 9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999  with in few seconds:

1.DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized.py has been changed to increase k to 100 which factorizes a difficult 1000 bits integer of mixed digits (low omega and less number of prime factors) which is by far the largest integer factorized in NeuronRain - 99320930203909302903909209302309029309029039203819821892891217288172871728718728172817287187281728718728178728173183617637939029309112882189434889893898293112982918998767676767565656545455343787878787876767566565645454534434333878738728738278372243439848343884384983984989483849839483984983984983984977 - in O((logN)^100) Parallel RAM time requiring O(N/(logN)^100) PRAM processors - first few factors are printed below within 20 seconds and 73 seconds respectively which includes Spark-Python-Py4j-Java 8 bidirectional marshalling and VM bytecode interpretation overhead (Cythonized C++ DLL version might be still faster):

2.Previous complexity bounds imply O(1000^100) parallel time units (polylog depth) and O(2^1000/1000^100) processors ~= O(2^1000/2^997) = O(8) PRAMS (multicores) which is a meagre NC parallelism required for factorizing such a huge number - seemingly prohibitive O(N/(logN)^k)) PRAMs in definition of NC might not be a roadblock after all.
3.Recursion limit has been increased to 3000 because of stack overflow in recursive binary search and ray shooting queries have been commented.

2.float() cast has been changed to Decimal() for highest precision and remove overflow errors for tile segments and interval midpoint computations
3.Recursion limit has been increased to 10000
4.Exponentiation by math.pow() for normal order computation in local search optimization has been replaced by faster ** exponentiation operator of Python.
5.Exponent k in local search loop - (logN)^k (iterations) * N/(logN)^k (PRAMs) - has been parametrized in SearchTiles_and_Factorize() function which simulates non-uniform NC circuit of (logN)^k depth and N/(logN)^k circuit elements.

Optimization:
-------------
Finding all factors by searching through every rasterized tile segment for hyperbola xy=N could be optimized by stopping after first factor p is found and re-rasterizing a new hyperbolic arc for xy=N/p. Following loop formalizes it (reduction in cost might depend on which is easier - parallel planar point location or rasterization - this optimization creates an array of hyperbolic arc bows equal to number of factors):
	for_all_factors_of_N
	{
		Rasterize hyperbola xy=N
		PRAM-BSP-NC Planar Point locate and Search the rasterized hyperbolic planar straight line graph till first factor p is found
		N=N/p
	}

Previous loop is of approximate total parallel RAM time (excluding parallel rasterization which is increasingly easier after each iteration churning out a factor):
	O((log p1)^k) + O((log N/p1)^k) + O((log N/[p1*p2])^k) + ... + O((log N/[p1*p2*...pn])^k) for first n factors of N={p1,p2,...,pn}

738.16 Zone Theorem and Ray shooting queries for approximate factors intersecting rasterized hyperbolic segment arrangement - http://homepages.math.uic.edu/~jan/mcs481/zonetheorem.pdf - Set of faces in an arrangement of lines intersecting a query ray is a Zone of ray query. Zone complexity is the sum of number of vertices,edges and faces in zone of a query ray. Zone theorem states that Zone complexity of an arrangement of m lines and a query ray is O(m). Hyperbolic rasterization produces an arrangement of O(N) lines. But yet because of being axis parallel, every ray shooting query from origin (0,0) intersects only 3 faces of the rasterized arrangement at most (above, pixel array rectangle, below) and thus zone complexity of ray shooting is a constant 3.
738.17 Approximate Factors and Local search for exact factor point location - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_search_(optimization) - Approximate factors found by number theoretic results are in close proximity to exact factors. Local search optimization finds exact solution to an optimization problem from candidate solutions and iteratively refines. Finding exact factors from approximate factors could be formulated as local search problem e.g Approximate factor ax for an integer N could be refined by incrementing (decrementing) along x-axis - a kind of hill-climbing on hyperbolic arc. Local search algorithms could have arbitrary, user-defined runtimes.

(*) Drone Electronic Voting Machine on GPS navigation to a voter's residence optionally can have an one time password multifactor authentication before voting. Traditional OTPs are electronic prone to sabotage. Alternatively a non-digital OTP authentication is envisaged e.g serial number of a currency bill (only one voter in nation at any point in time can possess a note having a unique serial number if there are negligible counterfeits).Drone EVM reads the unique serial number in note by OCR before voting. Encrypted vote to a candidate salted with 
 encrypted OCR-ed serial number of the currency is appended to voted candidate's bucket. Voter can have multiple non-digital currencies (multiple serial number unique ids) which are chosen at random by voter for OCR. Currencies are anonymous and unpredictably flow in economic networks which further randomizes the non-digital OTPs (high entropy randomness extractor source). 
(*) QR codes are unique id(s) - two dimensional quick response bar codes
(*) NeuronRain KingCobra implements a protocol buffer cryptocurrency which is serial numbered by Boost Universally Unique Identifier(based on Perfect Forward copyless move idiom of C++ - has parallels to Cloud Object move in Google Clouds - more on this in http://neuronrain-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Exchequer in some countries is RFID tagged for tracking money trail and similar reasoning might apply for voter uniqueness - RFID tagged currency authentication at drone EVM.
(*) Genetic Haplogroups of populace have specific cluster of traits across ethnic groups which might be occasionally necessary to establish uniqueness (e.g India has prominence of R1a1a... haplogroup - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1380230/). 
(*) Vandermonde interpolation polynomial is guaranteed to be unique for set of points to be interpolated. This set of points could be strings sourced from multiple identification traits of a person which can be Rabin fingerprinted by a polynomial over GF(2) modulo an irreducible polynomial over GF(2). This set of fingerprinted data points are then interpolated by a Vandermonde unique polynomial to ID a voter.
(*) Sports Analytics and Intrinsic Performance Rankings have been mentioned in GRAFIT course material as a BigData usecase (https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/Grafit/blob/master/course_material/NeuronRain/LinuxKernelAndCloud/BigdataAnalyticsCloud_CourseNotes.txt) - e.g ATP,WTA,NBA,ICC. Academic Rankings (rankings of researchers and universities - USA today,Times Higher Education) could leverage from Sports Rankings e.g Number of experimentally verified papers of an author in relativity and quantum mechanics with no dependency on number of citations is a measure of intrinsic research quality
(*) Evidence usecase for BKS conjecture: Everyone agrees on denomination of a currency bill or coin - $100 is universally accepted consensually as equal to $100 discounting devaluation and other economic phenomena. If this fact is formulated as an LTF or PTF - value(x) = x - could evidence the truth of BKS conjecture implying consensus is stabler than majority function.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(*) Drone Electronic Voting Machine implementation in Streaming_SetPartitionAnalytics.py - electronic_voting_machine() - has been updated to simulate random shuffle of paper ballots in boxes to ensure disorder - votes appended to bucket per candidate are shuffled after each vote - every new vote is randomly inserted into obfuscated encrypted bucket of votes per candidate which simulates a shuffle (shuffle is essentially a permutation group Sn) while an exact shuffle has to enumerate the permutation group (O(n!)) and choose one element - every shuffle of a candidate bucket is also a reduction from space filling and random closed packing
(*) Drone EVM implementation has been upgraded to Python 3.7.5 by autopep8 and 2to3 utilities and 2.7 version has been separately committed with eponymous suffix - random.randint() has been invoked to get an index to insert a new vote somewhere in the candidate bucket 
(*) Traditional incremental counters coalesce votes of multiple voters into one integer which prohibits forensic examination of individual votes if there is a dispute. Votes per candidate bucket thus isolates each anonymous encrypted vote but subverts chronological ordering.
(*) Serial number unique id(s) of paper currencies were envisaged earlier as non-digital one time passwords for authenticating a voter. Rationale for choice of currencies is the unpredictable pseudorandom flow of paper currency unique id(s) in economy which creates a huge EventNet Money Trail Graph (edges are labelled by flow of uniquely ID-ed currencies between buyers and sellers) which is non-digital and thus insulated from electronic sabotage. Money Trail EventNet Graph is a high entropy randomness source and could serve as a psueodrandomness generator and extractor e.g topological sort or random walk of a subgraph of money trail EventNet is a random concatenation of unique id(s)
(*) If Money Trail EventNet Graph is an edge expander, it could be a gadget for Pseudorandom Number Generator. Edge expander graphs are defined with Cheeger's constant for minimum high edge boundary per vertex subset:
	minimum(|boundary(S)|/|S|), 1 < |S| < n/2
where boundary(S) of a subset S of vertices of G (V(G)) is:
	boundary(S) = { (u,v) | u in S, v in V(G) \ S}
Random walks on an expander graph are conventionally applied to Pseudorandom Generators e.g. Margulis [Mar88] and Lubotzky, Phillips and Sarnak [LPS88]
(*) Locating an encrypted vote in a candidate bucket of votes (if bucket is a linked list) could be done in sublinear time by Parallel RAM Breadth First Search and Depth First Search of the linked list line graph - GRAFIT course material in  https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/Grafit/blob/master/course_material/NeuronRain/AdvancedComputerScienceAndMachineLearning/AdvancedComputerScienceAndMachineLearning.txt mention usefulness of parallel RAM sublinear linked list search in the context of Survival Index Timeout OS Scheduler version of Process IDs Set Partition in OS Kernels
(*) Limitations of unique identification are best explained by birthday paradox - GRAFIT course material in https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/Grafit/blob/master/course_material/ComputerScienceMiscellaneous/ComputerScienceMiscellaneous_CourseNotes.txt have a Q and A on birthday paradox probability of collision of unique IDs in a population.
(*) An expander graph simulation of Economic Network by Neuro Cryptocurrency in NeuronRain which is Boost UUID, Protocol Buffer, Perfect-Forward and Object Move based, theoretically could source pseudorandom bits.

Paper ballots and Drone EVM - comparison and contrast:
-----------------------------------------------------
Previous concept implementation of Drone EVM in NeuronRain has separate buckets for candidates which are independently shuffled to simulate paper ballots whereas real world paper ballot votes are sealed and cast in single ballot box bucket without candidate delineation. Instead if Drone EVM is implemented such that all encrypted votes are in a single shuffled list (or) linked list bucket (which is how paper ballots work), reduction is necessary which shatters/classifies the shuffled list/linked list of votes to a set partition of buckets of per-candidate lists/linked lists of votes. Example: 
	every node of the list/linked list of anonymous votes has the fields <candidate_id>:<encrypted_vote>. 
Usually this reduction happens post-poll in paper ballot counts. This sort of exact pseudorandom shuffle simulation of paper ballot box of assorted votes democratizes further and is a non-trivial monochromatic balls-bins problem in Drone EVM - every anonymous vote is colored by candidate index - single list (or) linked list line graph of votes of previous format has to be set/graph-partitioned to candidate buckets of multiple lists/line graphs (or) a multichromatic set has to be partitioned to monochromatic candidate bucket subsets - an O(N) labelled classifier. Sequence of N votes for k candidates is thus Ramsey k-colored and order emerges inevitably by Van Der Waerden Theorem - there exist numbers N,k,r such that if shuffled sequence of N votes are colored by k candidates, there is a monchromatic arithmetic progression of length atleast r (in other words, r voters who had voted for same candidate are equally spaced out which presents an insight into voting pattern).

Conflict between pseudorandomness and arithmetic progressions in Ramsey coloring of votes - Orderly Disorder:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Previous simulation of pseudorandom paper ballot shuffle in Drone EVM gives rise to a multichromatic sequence of votes colored by candidate indices. But yet monochromatic arithmetic progression order emerges from pseudorandom disorder irrespective of number of colors (candidates) and voting chronology which is a contradiction. This "orderly disorder" oxymoron paradox should apply universally to any pseudorandomly shuffled multichromatic set not just limited to shuffled voting sequences. This limitation implies a prerequisite for indistinguishability of pseudorandom generators (PRG) from true randomness - PRGs should create pseudorandomly shuffled multicolored sequences of Ramsey number R(N,k,r) of high N,k and low r - Sequence of N elements, k-colored having an arithmetic progression of length atleast r - which lessens the probability of emergence of arithmetic progression periodicities. On a related note, Period Three Theorem of Chaos theory (www.its.caltech.edu/~matilde/LiYorke.pdf) implies sequences of periodicity 3 can have larger periodicities.

742. (THEORY and FEATURE) Computational Geometric Factorization - Quadcore Python 3.7.5 + Spark 2.4.3 benchmarks - 1024 bits integers - 11 January 2020 - related to all sections on Factorization
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(*) Few 1024 bits hard random integers of mixed digits have been factorized and logs have been captured in testlogs/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized.Python3.7.5Upgrade.1024bits.11January2020 - all the integers are factorized from 28 seconds onwards - logs have been truncated and only first few factors are printed.

(*) DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized.py has been changed to print debug statements for verifying correctness of factorization - or clause "if factorcandidate == number_to_factorize or xl*yl == number_to_factorize:" is true if point located in pixel arithmetic progression array polygon of the rasterized hyperbola equals the number to factorize N in two cases:
	(*) ordinate product xl*yl equals number to factorize N 
		(and/or)
	(*) ordinate product (xl + intervalmidpoint)*yl equals number to factorize N
(*) Truth values of both the above scenarios are printed and verified factor ordered pairs are printed accordingly. Decimal division has been reverted because of misleading mantissa-exponent notation

743. (THEORY and FEATURE) Chaos Pseudorandom Generators - implementation update - Logistic and Lehmer-Palmore PRGs - 21 January 2020 - related to 318, 740 and all sections on Intrinsic Merit, Majority Voting, Ramsey coloring, Hardness Amplification, One-Way Functions, Chaos, Pseudorandomness and draft Randomized NC Chaos PRG defined in https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/ChaoticPRG.pdf
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(*) Logistic Equation Chaos PRG implementation in ChaosAttractor.py has been updated to also compute Lehmer-Palmore PRG by a function argument. An if clause has been introduced to choose between parabola attractor rx(1-x) and Lehmer-Palmore PRG (Bx mod M)
(*) ChaosAttractor.py Lorenz Attractor code has been refactored and made a function of parameters: ChaosPRG(algorithm="Logistic",seqlen=100,radix=10,initialcondition=0.7,prime=104729) which respectively choose the algorithm ("Logistic" equation or "Lehmer-Palmore" prime modulus PRGs), length of pseudorandom sequence, radix (k for "Logistic" and B for "Lehmer-Palmore"), initial condition for sensitive dependence and a Large prime modulus
(*) R cor() correlation function has been invoked by R+rpy2 to print a correlation between pseudorandom sequence and a sample DJIA stock  quotes dataset.
(*) ChaosPRG() function can be optionally invoked in NeuronRain wherever pseudorandomness is necessary - e.g Pseudorandom shuffle simulation of paper ballot in Drone Electronic Voting Machine, Pseudorandom Shuffle of 2-colored (0 and 1) leaves in a boolean majority voting circuit which gives rise to monochromatic arithmetic progression order from pseudorandom chaotic shuffled votes disorder by Ramsey theory (Van Der Waerden numbers), Economic merit - Models for Econometric Datasets
(*) Section 318 states a Majority version of XOR Hardness Amplification Lemma and points 318.15 to 318.19 define hardness of inverting boolean majority + voter SAT composition which might imply existence of an one way function (a #P-complete counting problem). Emergence of arithmetic progression order from binary colored voter leaves of Boolean Majority Circuit stipulates a prima facie indistinguishability condition between a good PRG and true randomness - Good pseudorandom shuffle must minimize probability of emergence of monochromatic arithmetic progressions in the leaves of boolean majority circuit.
(*) Probability of monochromatic arithmetic progressions in any pseudorandom bichromatic sequence of length N (including shuffled 2-colored voter leaves of boolean majority circuit) is inversely proportional to Van Der Waerden number VDW(N,2,r) - N elements in sequence(voters), 2 colors (candidates 0 and 1), arithmetic progression of length >= r (voters who chose same candidate are equally spread out in the shuffled bichromatic votes string).
(*) Chaos implies disorder from order (Period Three Theorem implies any sequence of period 3 can have larger periods while Feigenbaum sequences define self-referential recursive universality order in Chaos) and monochromatic arithmetic progressions in Pseudorandom multichromatic sequences imply order from disorder - these are two mutually conflicting trends in diametrically opposite directions.
(*) logs testlogs/ChaosAttractor.LehmerPalmorePRG.log.21January2020 and testlogs/ChaosAttractor.LogisticEquationPRG.log.21January2020 print a correlation between DJIA data and two chaotic PRGs - Logistic and Lehmer-Palmore. Opposing correlation signs between Logistic and Lehmer-Palmore PRGs and DJIA sample is an indicator of extent of chaos and pattern in economic data:
	Logistic: correlation coefficient of pseudorandom and DJIA sequences is: -0.00173395205970038
	Lehmer-Palmore: correlation coefficient of pseudorandom and DJIA sequences is: 0.00648048041159691
(*) Equilibrium point where the aforementioned Orderly Disorder (Ramsey) and Disorderly Order (Chaos) coincide might be of independent area of research.

744. (THEORY and FEATURE) Chaotic Pseudorandom Generator - Python 3.7.5 upgrade, Computational Geometric Factorization - 30 January 2020 -
related to all sections on Pseudorandom Generators, Chaos and Factorization
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.This commit upgrades Chaos Pseudorandom Generator implementation to Python 3.7.5 by autopep8 followed by 2to3, which is the defacto NeuronRain recommended python version for performance reasons.
2.Both Logistic and Lehmer-Palmore PRGs have been tested on Python 3.7.5 + R-py2 combine and logs are committed to testlogs/ChaosAttractor.Python3.7.5Upgrade.30January2020
3.GRAFIT course material on Geometric search of BigData in https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/Grafit/blob/master/course_material/NeuronRain/LinuxKernelAndCloud/BigdataAnalyticsCloud_CourseNotes.txt describe a Randomized NC factorization algorithm based on Parallel Chaotic Pseudorandom Generator and Central Limit Theorem based Space filling Linear Program mentioned in drafts - https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/ChaoticPRG.pdf and https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/Analysis%20of%20a%20Randomized%20Space%20Filling%20Algorithm%20and%20its%20Linear%20Program%20Formulation.pdf . 
4.Exact PRAM-NC-BSP computational geometric factorization algorithm implemented on Spark in NeuronRain AstroInfer is the derandomized version of Randomized NC Bernoulli trials factorization algorithm in https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/Grafit/blob/master/course_material/NeuronRain/LinuxKernelAndCloud/BigdataAnalyticsCloud_CourseNotes.txt which has the success probability of finding atleast one prime factor pr(m) = (1 - sqrt(2N)/(N*sqrt(2) - sqrt(2) - sqrt(N)))^(m-1)*(sqrt(2N)/(N*sqrt(2) - sqrt(2) - sqrt(N)) after m trials for square embedded hyperbolic arc. Expected number of trials E(m) before atleast one factor is found = sum_x=1-to-N(x*pr(x))
5.Thus NeuronRain Theory drafts define 3 different Nick's class Computational Geometric Integer factorization algorithms - Randomized NC, Quantum NC, Exact NC - which transition from a randomized, cohered quantum state to classical exact decohered state.

744.5 Game theoretic model of epidemics - https://www.elsevier.com/connect/using-game-theory-to-predict-peoples-behavior-in-an-epidemic - "...When there’s no epidemic, everyone behaves normally. In the event of an outbreak, changing behavior will be costly in some way – perhaps people stay home from work or avoid crowded environments, change their commute or buy preventative medication. But there’s also a payoff: people  who change behavior are less likely to be infected. At a certain point in the epidemic, those people have an advantage in the population, and others begin to copy their behavior...We applied game theory to these dynamics and produced a mathematical model that shows how people’s responses can affect the spread of a disease during an epidemic. We found that reducing the number of people an individual is in contact with, even by a small amount, can make a difference to the  spread of disease..." - NeuronRain USBmd analyzer for malwares game theoretically (game between saboteur and sabotaged) is motivated on creating information or mining patterns in software viri and cybercrimes to counteract the spread, isolate infected systems, shutting down broadband networks and any instrument emitting RF(radio-frequency) and zero-in on origin - a PredPol. Translating this to epidemiology is obvious - information on prevention minimizes infection. But an apparent contradiction arises - Per 744.2 Verhulst model, if a > 3.57 when epidemic becomes chaotic to predict, rate of infection could outpace and be out of sync with information.

745. (THEORY and FEATURE) Compressed Sensing - Alphabet-Syllable vectorspace embedding - Python 3.7.5 upgrade - update - 4 February 2020
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Function syllable_boundary_text_compression(self, text, vectorspace_embedding=True) in CompressedSensing python implementation has been updated to parametrically choose alphabet vectorspace embedding of words in text described in GRAFIT course material on Geometric Search - https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/Grafit/blob/master/course_material/NeuronRain/LinuxKernelAndCloud/BigdataAnalyticsCloud_CourseNotes.txt - words of text are embedded in |A|^m vectorspace (|A| is the size of natural language alphabet and m is the longest word in text). For English, this is a space of 26^m.
2.Words are python tokenized to vectors and concatenated to an array creating a vectorspace embedding words in the text document.
3.Return value is a tuple which includes or excludes the word embedding of text depending on vectorspace_embedding boolean flag
4.CompressedSensing.py has been upgraded to Python 3.7.5 by autopep8 and 2to3 utilities. Python 2.7 version is separately committed.
5.An Example sentence is syllable hyphenated (PyHyphen), vowel stripped-compressed and embedded as:
#####################################################################################################
Vowelless Syllable Vector Compression for text -  This sentence is alphabet-syllable vector space embedded  : (['This', 'sen', 'tence', 'al', 'pha', 'bet', '-', 'syl', 'la', 'ble', 'vec', 'tor', 'space', 'em', 'bed', 'ded'], 'Th_s-s_n-t_nc_-_l-ph_-b_t---syl-l_-bl_-v_c-t_r-sp_c_-_m-b_d-d_d')
Alphabet vectorspace embedding of text: [['T', 'h', 'i', 's'], ['s', 'e', 'n', 't', 'e', 'n', 'c', 'e'], ['i', 's'], ['a', 'l', 'p', 'h', 'a', 'b', 'e', 't', '-', 's', 'y', 'l', 'l', 'a', 'b', 'l', 'e'], ['v', 'e', 'c', 't', 'o', 'r'], ['s', 'p', 'a', 'c', 'e'], ['e', 'm', 'b', 'e', 'd', 'd', 'e', 'd'], []]
6.This kind of embedding is unconventional because it lifts an one dimensional text to an m-dimensional vectorspace nullifying the meaning of the word whereas traditional word embeddings reduce dimensionality and map words in higher dimensional space to real vectorspace of lower dimensions. Following the linguistic philosophy of "word is characterized by company it keeps" by [Firth] (Studies in Linguistic Analysis - http://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci2952d/readings/lecture1-firth.pdf), alphabet embedding above could be a framework for assessing colocated words by euclidean distance e.g "vector" and "space" are colocated in previous example and are closer in meaning (e.g WordNet distance) but have high euclidean distance. This kind of alphabet embedding is quite relevant to similar name clustering where same name is spelt differently ("What is in a name" is a non-trivial question to answer).

746. (THEORY and FEATURE) Social Network Analysis - People Analytics - Alphabet-Syllable vectorspace embedding - Python 3.7.5 upgrade - Name clustering - 4 February 2020
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.SocialNetworkAnalysis_PeopleAnalytics.py and its dependencies have been upgraded to Python 3.7.5 (CompressedSensing.py,TextCompression.py,WordSubstringProbabilities.py) by autopep8 and 2to3 utilities. Python 2.7 versions have been separately committed.
2.Example Professional Profile (of the author) has been updated in testlogs/CV.pdf and testlogs/CV.tex which is parsed for text and previously updated syllable_boundary_text_compression() function of CompressedSensing.py is invoked on profile text for alphabet vectorspace embedding of words.
3.Logs for this commit are in testlogs/SocialNetworkAnalysis_PeopleAnalytics.log.Python3.7.5UpgradeWordEmbedding.4February2020 which demonstrate 3 alphabet vectorspace embeddings of same first name of the author spelt differently having low mutual euclidean distance.
4.Syllable embedding instead of alphabet embedding of words causes linguistic boundaries to vanish which has been mentioned in an earlier code commit - transliterating text of one script lacking compound alphabets to another script bestowed with compound alphabets helps in natural language text compression.
5.Match Rating algorithm NYSIIS (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Identification_and_Intelligence_System) which is better than Soundex codes is an example of efficient Similar Name Search. Linguistically similar names are intersections of heterographs (different spellings and meanings) and synonyms (different spellings and same meaning) - Homophones - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophone

(first few factors are 7,9,11,21,27,... found from 204 seconds onwards - unusually high duration compared to previous 2000+ bits integers implies hardness)
3. Previous 2000plus bits integers are the largest factorized by NeuronRain AstroInfer Spark NC-PRAM-BSP implementation.
4. Depth of the non-uniform circuits are 182,184 and 184 respectively for 2014 bits, 2037 bits and 2050 bits integers. PRAM time O(logN)^k) for 2050 bits factorization circuit of depth 184 therefore is O(2050^184) and number of PRAMs required are O(2^2050/2050^184) = O(2^2050/2^2025) = O(2^25) = 33554432 which is high number of multicores but plausible in a geographically distributed BSP cloud.
5. Increasing depth slows down the PRAM time but reduces the parallel RAMs. Notwithstanding this theoretically prohibitive parallelism factors of 2050 bits hard integer were found in quadcore in few minutes.

748. (THEORY and FEATURE) Leaky Bucket Timeseries Analyzer Implementation - Python 3.7.5 - 12 February 2020
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.This commit implements Leaky Bucket Timeseries Analyzer Algorithm mentioned in GRAFIT course material https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/Grafit/blob/master/course_material/NeuronRain/AdvancedComputerScienceAndMachineLearning/AdvancedComputerScienceAndMachineLearning.txt for generic timeseries analytics. 
2.Streaming_LeakyBucket.py instantiates Streaming Abstract Generator buffer incoming stream (example Dictionary.txt file data source is analyzed as timeseries) for generic data source and data storage of specified buffer size.
3.leaky_bucket_timeseries_analyzer() iterates through buffer incoming stream and in a loop populates a deque object till it reaches maximum size . Elements exceeding max size are overflown and printed. Deque simulates a leaky bucket - incoming elements fill the bucket from front end (insert() at index 0) and outgoing elements leak through other end.
4.Separate thread outgoing_stream_thread() independently scans the leaky bucket buffer and pops the elements from the deque. It busy waits if the leaky bucket deque is empty and continues to pop after buffer is refilled.
5.Synchronization is by a binary semaphore guarding the deque in main thread and outgoing stream thread.
6.Theoretical overtone of leaky bucket is its ability to flag outliers by overflows and peaks in timeseries are often the abnormalities in stream causing overflow. For example excessive network traffic corresponds to peaks in timeseries data and frequent overflows in leaky bucket as buffer fills faster than leakage.
7.Leaky Bucket Analyzer thus is a universal tool for mining any stream of text,audio,video,people data and most apt for wireless network stream, stream of celestial bodies configurations, climate change datastream (e.g http://climate.nasa.gov data stream on surface temperature, melting polar ice sheets, carbon emission, ocean currents and acidity), economic datasets having lot of outlier spikes. 
8.Streaming_LeakyBucket.py has been implemented on Python 3.7.5 and Streaming_AbstractGenerator.py has been upgraded to Python 3.7.5
9.Logs for dictionary time series example are at testlogs/Streaming_LeakyBucket.log.12February2020

749. (THEORY and FEATURE) PAC Learning - Python 3.7.5 upgrade, Riemann Hypothesis, Patterns in Primes, class HNc and Algebraic Circuits - 21 February 2020, 22 February 2020 - related to 24,629 and all sections on Complement diophantines, Complementary Sets and Equations, Prime-Composite complementation and Patterns in Primes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. PACLearning.py PAC learning implementation has been refactored and upgraded to Python 3.7.5. Binary encoded and bits mapped UTM Primes dataset has been PAC Learnt again for per-prime-bit-position boolean disjunctions of first 10000 primes (16 disjunctions for each bit of 16-bits prime integer). New refactored PACLearning() function accepts a generic datasource and a hypothesis dictionary as arguments.
2. Example logs for this PAC learning are at testlogs/PACLearning.PrimeBitsMappingConjunctions.Python3.7.5.21February2020 which are different from Python 2.7 approximate learning.
3. Prime pattern References in Section 24 (24.31, 24.32, 24.33) mention a prima facie pattern in juxtaposed primes especially their avoidance of same digit ending. PAC learnt hypothesis in testlogs/PACLearning.PrimeBitsMappingConjunctions.Python3.7.5.21February2020 show an intriguing avoidance pattern in 14th,15th and 16th bits for first 10000 primes though approximate.
4. Prime counting function (number of primes <= N) can be written in terms of non-trivial zeros of Riemann Zeta Function. Riemann Hypothesis (RH) conjectures all non-trivial zeros of Riemann Zeta Function are along critical line Re(z)=0.5. Riemann Zeta Function is just a rephrased version of Sieve of Eratosthenes and is expanded by Euler product.
5. From Section 629, Riemann Zeta Function has an algebraic computation tree circuit in HNc:
	"... Riemann Zeta Function can be represented as a disjunctive clauses or non-uniform Hilbert Nullstellensatz algebraic circuit in 
	0-1-HNc (0 if s is a non-trivial zero else 1) of product polynomials having complex roots (non-trivial zeros): 
	RZF=product_of(1/[1-prime(k)^(-s)]) for all primes 2,3,5,7,..."
6.Approximate binary digit hypothesis disjunctions for primes dataset learnt by PAC and exact learning by Euler-Fourier polynomial imply pattern in spacings between consecutive primes and thus are indirect boolean prime counting functions. Both Euler-Fourier polynomial and PAC learnt disjunctive clauses are mapping functions between integer n and i-th bit of n-th prime - f(n,i): n <=> i-th bit of n-th prime
7.Riemann Zeta Function has diophantine equation representation and thus in RE by MRDP theorem. Recent result of MIP*=RE implies a quantum multiparty interactive prover-classical verifier algorithm for diophantine and algebraic circuit versions of Riemann Zeta Function. It is notable and coincidental that distribution of Gaussian Unitary Ensemble eigenvalues in quantum world are identical to spacings of non-trivial zeros of RZF.

Diophantine representation of RZF is in Adleman-Manders class D and is in RE by MRDP theorem. MIP*=RE implies Riemann Zeta Function (RZF) and Riemann Hypothesis has a quantum verification algorithm which halts despite infinite number of non-trivial zeros of RZF. Similar to computerized proof of Four color theorem this could be a machine generated proof or disproof of Riemann Hypothesis - An example quantum algorithm for proving or disproving Riemann hypothesis in MIP*=RE:
	- Multiparty interactive quantum prover finds all non-trivial zeros of RZF
	- classical verifier checks real part of all non-trivial zeroes for Re(z)=0.5 and finds a counter-example for disproof or a lack of it for proof of Riemann Hypothesis.

782. (THEORY and FEATURE) Text Compression, Compressed Sensing, Syllable boundaries decompression implementation - Python 3.7.5 upgrade and refactoring - 28 February 2020, 29 February 2020
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.TextCompression.py vowelless text compression-decompression implementation has been upgraded to Python 3.7.5 by autopep8 and 2to3 utilities
2.Syllable boundaries text compression function from CompressedSensing.py has been imported to optionally choose between syllable boundary compression of text and earlier vowelless compression (which strips vowels across the board) by a boolean flag syllable_boundary
3.Earlier commented code for PyEnchant spelling suggestions has been uncommented to choose between PyEnchant maximum likelihood (prob() function) and Hidden Markov Model maximum likelihood (HiddenMarkovModel_MLE() function) estimators based on if suggestions is not-None and None respectively.
4.Both PyEnchant and HMM computed maximum likelihood words are printed to logs.
5.Logs at testlogs/TextCompression.log.28February2020 contain PyEnchant and Hidden Markov Model maximum likelihood estimations per decompressed string for both vowel compressed and syllable boundary compressed words
6.decompressedtext.txt contains the newly introduced approximate syllable boundary decompressed text:

ghts fer over  with lus tins    der ly2 on dead ster nal     ve tting  pro mer dial   placed be form byss paw er ful  ry mev ing  grant  ybody wn ters ician milk  shy ser pant ged form ing cotch shed  sh mania

for exact text:
Rama gets forever pleased with him who listens to or reads Ramayana daily. He is indeed the eternal Vishnu, the Lord of preservation. Rama is the primordial Lord, clearly placed before the eyes the powerful Lord removing the sins and the great-armed, who has abode on waters of the ocean of milk Sesha the serpent-god forming his couch is said to be Lakshmana.

7. It is worth observing how the words "primordial", "removing","serpent" and "powerful" have been syllable decompressed - "pro mer dial", "ry mev ing", "ser pant", "paw er ful" - to homophones (phonetically equivalent but linguistically different)
8.Advantage of syllable boundaries is their language and script independence, dependence on phonetics alone, fine-graining of words to syllables for better accuracy in phonetic decompression.
9.Embedding a text on syllable vector space as opposed to traditional flat one-dimension thus blurs linguistic boundaries and useful for similar name clustering.

783. (THEORY) Phonetic Syllable Boundaries Compression and Approximate Decompression - error bounds and success amplification - 1 March 2020
- related to all sections on Text Compression, Compressed Sensing and People Analytics - Similar name match
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Approximate Syllable Boundaries Decompression in earlier example can be phonetically matched for further error correction and accuracy. Example decompression of "powerful" to "paw er ful" demonstrates approximate phonetic match which requires lookup of per word audio dictionary to spell out a matching word (e.g Interactive Voice Response). By finding the best phonetic match of "paw er ful" in a syllable audio dictionary (which is a map of collated-syllable-audio-of-words to words), "paw er ful" is further decoded to "powerful" thus amplifying success. Phonetic match therefore involves an audio waveform distance function of two words different from string edit distance text similarity (e.g waveforms of "paw er ful" and "powerful" are in proximity). This audio-to-words dictionary is static containing as many words in language and requires initialization only once. Another prerequisite is a syllables-to-audio dictionary for lookup of every syllable in approximately decompressed word and splice their audio waveforms (e.g waveforms of syllables "paw","er","ful" are lookedup and collated to obtain "paw er ful") which is then lookedup in audio-to-words dictionary (e.g waveform for "paw"+"er"+"ful" is lookedup to retrieve "powerful").

Number of vowels per english word (approximate) = length_of_the_word / 3 (because on the average every third letter of a word is a vowel)
Number of vowels per english word syllable (approximate) = 1
Number of syllables per english word = length_of_the_word / 3

Probability of erroneous decompression per english word syllable = 4/5 = choice of wrong vowel in a,e,i,o,u
Probability of wrong decompression of a word  = (0.8)^(l/3) (l = length_of_the_word)
Probability of successful phonetic decompression increases therefore with increasing length of the word.

792. (FEATURE) Social Network Analytics - LinkedIn Connections Analysis, Name filter and Python 3.7.5 upgrades - 4 March 2020
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.SocialNetworkAnalysis_PeopleAnalytics.py - Connections in a Professional Network Profile have been analyzed by Recursive Lambda Function Growth (RLFG) after applying name filters to strip off Human names of connections and only extract their professional roles.
2.Name filter works by looking up words in profile connections text in a dictionary and filters Proper nouns (Human Names) - rationale is 
a language dictionary should not contain human names or contain least human names and is a short-cut stop-gap algorithm to recognize proper nouns while an artificial intelligence culture-neutral name parsing alternative might involve extensive training data and deep learning.
3.Dictionary.txt file already committed for CompressedSensing has been preferred to nondictionaryword() in RecursiveGlossOverlap_Classifier.py which repetitively invokes slower REST lookup - first word in each line of Dictionary.txt (Concise Oxford Dictionary) has been parsed to create an array of words 
4.Quite a few dependent python source files have been upgraded to Python 3.7.5 including the very necessary RecursiveLambaFunctionGrowth.py implementation for performance by autopep8 and 2to3 utilities.
5.Dense subgraph extracted from definition graph of professional descriptions of connections is an indication of prominent designations/skills pattern.
6.Machine Translation has been commented because of slow REST calls to Google Translate.
7.Unfeasible Exception has been handled in korner_entropy() - maximal independent set computation.
8.Only a fraction of connections profile contents is analyzed because of intensive computation. 
9.logs at testlogs/SocialNetworkAnalysis_PeopleAnalytics.log.ConnectionsRLFGAnalysis.4March2020.gz contain exhaustive graph theoretic analysis of LinkedIn Connections of the author (K.Srinivasan - https://www.linkedin.com/in/srinivasan-kannan-608a671/) and to large extent core numbers reflect the designations/skills profile. 
10.Of all the graph complexity measures, closeness centrality is more accurate than others - top ranked vertices which directly relate to designations are (and still there are Human names because dictionary attack is just an approximation):

793. (THEORY and FEATURE) GIS and Urban Sprawl Analytics - Image Segmentation and Face components statistics,Dual Graph,Four color theorem 
- 12 March 2020
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.ImageNet Keras-Theano + OpenCV + Python 3.7.5 implementation - ImageGraph_Keras_Theano.py - has been changed for computing statistics of image segmentation by watershed algorithm.
2.image_segmentation() function has been augmented to invoke cv2.connectedComponentsWithStatsWithAlgorithm(sure_fg,connectivity=8,ltype=2,ccltype=cv2.CCL_GRANA) which computes the connected face components of foreground image accompanied by statistics and algorithm parameters. 8-way connectivity of an image by GRANA connected components algorithm is computed. cv2.connectedComponents() is limited to markers only.
3.Labels,Centroids and Statistics of each connected component of a segmented image are printed. Every component of segmented image is also a face in graph theoretic terms and a dual graph of adjacent faces can be drawn connecting centroids of faces. 
4.By Four color theorem (a kind of Multiple Agent Resource Allocation), centroids of adjacent faces could be made color-repulsive - every face and thus its centroid can be colored by one of the four categories (Manufacturing-IT-ITES,Residential,Commercial,Greenery) and adjacent faces avoid same color. Dense subgraphs of Colored Weighted Dual graph (vertices are colored by one of the 4 categories and edges are labelled by distance between centroids of the faces) of segmented urban sprawl GIS offer insight into urbanization, expansion and density. 
5.An example montage MP4 video (Example Video 1 - Erstwhile Research Scholar profile - 1995-2011 - academics and industry - of the author) has been benchmarked again along with a segmentation of Chennai Urban Sprawl GIS JPEG (SEDAC - http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/mapping/popest/gpw-v4/).
6.Logs at testlogs/ImageGraph_Keras_Theano.log.12March2020 show two prominent segments of Chennai Urban Sprawl and their centroids.

810. (THEORY and FEATURE) GIS and Urban Sprawl Analytics - Delaunay Triangulation and Voronoi diagram of Segmented Image, Intrinsic Merit of
Large Scale Visuals, Computational Geometry - Planar Point Location, Computational Geometric Factorization - 16 March 2020, 17 March 2020, 
18 March 2020
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
1.ImageGraph_Keras_Theano.py image_segmentation() has been updated to approximately compute face graph of a segmented image by Voronoi diagram for segment centroids.
2.Centroids from connected components statistics are construed to be the points of a Voronoi diagram planar subdivision.
3.A planar rectangle of the size of image is instantiated by Subdiv2D() and centroids of image segment components are populated in planar
subdivision.
4.Delaunay triangles and Voronoi faces tesselation of the planar subdivision are obtained by OpenCV API - getTriangleList() and getVoronoiFacetsList().
5.Voronoi diagram draws boundaries optimally in a way such that centroids are equidistant from them and thus approximates the face graph for the connected segment components of the image which is essentially necessary to simulate envy-free allocation of four categories/colors of an urban sprawl and a fair division MARA. An alternative to Voronoi diagram could be to minimize a linear program of average weighted distance between centroids of segment faces - optimal weights of edges between face centroids decide the dimensions of every segment category:
		Minimize Sum(distance(Cx - Cy)) / |C| for set of centroids C={C1,C2,...,Ck}
6.For every facet in the Voronoi diagram which corresponds to a segment, a NetworkX vertex object is created by stringified concatentation of pixel ordinates delimited by "#".This uniquely identifies a vertex in facegraph. Edges are added for each face boundary in NetworkX Undirected graph. This NetworkX facegraph of an image is sufficient for graph theoretic analysis of any image.
7.Polygon is drawn for each face and NetworkX facegraph of an image in its entirety is written to a DOT file.
8.Two GIS images of Chennai Urban Sprawl have been segmented by watershed and their facegraphs have been plotted as PNG images. (There are graph theoretic alternatives to watershed viz., GRABCUT graph based image segmentation algorithm which is on similar line)
9.New video montage - Google Search of NeuronRain repositories and Google Scholar profile of author https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eLZY7CIAAAAJ&hl=en - has been recorded as MP4 and analyzed for EventNet Tensor Product Merit which is a good mix of visuals and text. Incidentally every frame of a video can also be segmented graph theoretically as FaceGraph as against ImageGraph analysis from ImageNet predictions. 
10. Segment centroid Voronoi diagrams are as well irregular bounding boxes implementations for an image as opposed to rectangles.
11. Voronoi Diagrams of frames in video dynamically morph and create a stream of FaceGraph(s) - for a movie or YouTube video example, actors per scene/event (set of consecutive frames) could be located by segmentation and Voronoi tesselation of segment centroids. Every segmented frame has a Voronoi FaceGraph whose faces contain actor centroids. For consecutive frames per scene, actor centroids arbitrarily float (Centroid Tracking) resulting in a stream of Dynamic Voronoi FaceGraph(s). Intuitively, set of FaceGraphs per scene or event are isomorphic. Merit of Visuals has two facets - style and substance. Substance of visual is measurable by Tensor Rank connectedness of information while Style often is a visual genre stereotype and narrative USP of a creator e.g laidback, offbeat, actionpacked, VFX. Patterns in narrative graph theoretically reduces to frequent subgraph mining problem - multiple movies or videos (stream of Voronoi facegraphs of frames) of a creator are mined for frequent subgraphs in facegraphs. 
12. Streaming Voronoi Tesselation of Videos is a Computational Geometric solution which involves all pervasive Planar Point Location - Voronoi Diagram FaceGraph is a Planar Subdivision of each Frame and Points to be located/tracked are Centroids of Faces/Segments(actors).
13. Rasterized Point Location in Computational Geometric Factorization could be expressed in terms of Voronoi Diagrams:
	13.1 Factors of an Integer (already found) are centroids of segments located on hyperbolic arc
	13.2 Voronoi diagrams subdivide 2D plane and find faces comprising every factor centroid
	13.3 Planar Point Location on Voronoi 2D planar subdivision locates the polygon face containing a factor point. Advantage of Rasterized hyperbolic arc: every polygon face is an axis-parallel arithmetic progression enabling binary search within faces.
14.Urban Sprawls are real counterparts of Social networks in virtual world - WWW, dynamic and undergo rapid expansion by preferential attachment - Good example of such an expansion is Chennai Urban Sprawl which is 8848 sqkm an eightfold expansion in 50 years from 1189 sqkms in 1970s. It is imperative that resource allocation is in tandem and keeps pace with urbanization and none of the four categories are found wanting. Graph theoretically, Subgraphs of FaceGraph of an Urban Sprawl by Voronoi Diagrams of segment centroids could be fairly allocated to categories by Multi Agent Graph Coloring. Expanding Urban sprawl grows the FaceGraph dynamically and new segments of various categories (and faces) are added in the periphery of the city. Multi Agent Four coloring of Urban sprawl FaceGraph therefore cannot be static and must be recomputed to catch up with this expanding dynamic facegraph. High Edge Expander facegraph of an urban sprawl has least Cheeger constant (low bottlenecks, high regularity and low eigenvalues) and high connectivity.

In this multiagent graph color- ing scenario, we seek a minimum legal coloring of the global graph’s vertices such that the coloring is also Pareto efficient, socially fair, and individual rational ... Every node corresponds to an agent, and each agent tries to determine its color so that neighbors do not have the same color." - Socially Fair Coloring of FaceGraphs of Urban Sprawls could involve Four colors (categories or agents) - Manufacturing-IT-ITES,Residential,Commercial,Greenery - which compete to grab their pie (subgraph) of Urban sprawl. Pareto optimal 4-coloring of Urban sprawl FaceGraph finds an efficient resource allocation.

811. (THEORY and FEATURE) Interview Algorithm - Spark Recursive Gloss Overlap Implementation - Python 3.7.5 upgrade and Quadcore Benchmarks
- 20 March 2020
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Spark Recursive Gloss Overlap MapReduce implementation in python-src/InterviewAlgorithm has been upgraded to Python 3.7.5 and benchmarked
on Quadcore. 
2.Earlier implementation on Python 2.7 and Dual core was slower because of local[2] which has been upgraded to local[4] for quadcores.
3.Memcache python client has been changed to pymemcache for Python 3.7.5 and pymemcache API changes have been incorporated.
4.Spark Python Recursive Gloss Overlap sources have been compiled to C by Cython3 (upgraded from Cython2) - following are commandline alternatives to setup.py and .so(s):
	cython3 <Python3.7.5_file.py> -o <Cython3_file.c>
	gcc -I<include_Python3.7_headers> <Cython3_file.c> -o <Cython3_executable> -lpython3.7m
5.Unicode encode() for Python 3 strings has been invoked wherever necessary
6.Pickle file is opened in 'a' and not 'ab' because of Python 3 bytes type conflict
7.Python 2.7 versions still depend on memcache python client, have .2.7 extension and Cython 2 .so(s) remain intact.
8.Replacement of Flat file pickle in MapReduce by memcache get/set was tried but the code for it has been left commented because of huge number of connection reset errors within memcache. This is despite lockdown of pages in memcache.conf and parallel connections set to 1024. In-memoy cache of Synsets in Spark mapreduce could reduce latency further and might be uncommented later.
9.2 sentences in small one liner file have been mapped to 2 textgraphs and timestamped textgraph plot images and logs are at InterviewAlgorithm/testlogs/

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
812.1.Recursive Lamda Function Growth Intrinsic Merit of a profile text has been benchmarked again on Python 3.7.5 upgraded implementation because of some misleading graph cores created in Python 2.7 by proper nouns (cities,organization names,institution names). Exceptions for word hyphenator maximum word length have been handled. Logs are at python-src/testlogs/SocialNetworkAnalysis_PeopleAnalytics.log.25March2020 
812.2.An example profile text (testlogs/CV.tex) of the author has been analyzed and dense subgraph analysis of its textgraph has been executed. Most of the proper nouns have been filtered from profile text but for few ambiguities (e.g "Sun","Global" are in dictionary but they were old first names of organizations author worked for and "Green" is name of NeuronRain repositories, "Gold medalist" is mistook for "Golf medalist") 
812.3.By and large top percentile core numbers of the profile textgraph reasonably reflect the stature of the profile and name filtering increases relevance of the dense subgraphs. Though anything can be written on a CV, an id verified profile content is a trustworthy measure of merit (Trusted Social Network Connections of professional profile in organizations worked vouch for authenticity despite being fame based citations) and facilitates autonomous recruitment if Merit Lowerbounds Fame:

812.4.Predictability of Tenure transitions of a profile can be effectively expressed as Chaotic Hidden Markov Model which is a combination of Verhulst Logistic and Hidden Markov Model. Verhulst-Pearl-Reed Logistic defines present observation X(n+1) in terms of previous X(n): X(n+1) = Lambda*X(n)*(1-X(n)). Hidden Markov Model on similar lines defines state transition probabilities and observations in each state. For this example profile, state transitions are organizations (including academic tenures and opensource initiative of the author) - in a gist left-to-right in chronological order (spanning 25 years - 1995-2020):
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
States: PSG - BaaN/SSA - Sun/Oracle - Krishna-iResearch - Verizon - webMethods/SoftwareAG - CMI/IIT/IMSc - GlobalAnalytics/GAIN - ClockWork - CloudEnablers - Unaffiliated private research
Observations: Could be any parameter - academic or work, opensource contribution, tenure duration, city, remuneration, designation in each organization, proven research, domain
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

812.5.Both Verhulst Law and Hidden Markov Model assume observation on present state depends only on observation on previous state and not cumulatively conditioned on all previous states or tenure switch is decided only by present independent of history (which would have otherwise been a Martingale sequence - E(Xi/X0,X1,X2,...,X(i-1)) = X(i-1) - expected observation in a state conditioned on all past states is the previous state observation - if each random variable Xi signifies one of the aforementioned observed parameters in an academic/work tenure state i). Chaotic Hidden Markov Model which is a merger based on this common fact underlying Chaos and HMM adds one more dimension to predictability of a profile or lack of it depending on value of Lambda.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.RecursiveLambdaFunctionGrowth.py implementation has been changed to uncomment machine_translation(). But yet because of REST ratelimit
English-Telegu translation is marred by "too many requests" exceptions. Exception handling and error checks have been added in machine_translation() for NoneType and ratelimit exceptions. Alternative could be local lookup of English-Telegu dictionary from flat file.
2.Self loop edges have been removed because of exceptions in rich club coefficient computation for the textgraph.
3.A news article on Chennai Urban Sprawl expansion has been mapped to textgraph and merit measures are printed to logs testlogs/RecursiveLambdaFunctionGrowth.log.MachineTranslation.25March2020. Telegu font decoding errors have created a Roman script graph. Proper noun filtering could further fine tune the objective meaning of the news article textgraph.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized.py has been changed to handle exceptions in Factor Spark Accumulator
object by stripping off zero-es in zero() function.
2.Streaming_SetPartitionAnalytics.py has been changed for subprocess invocation commandline of factorization. Error handling for size of
arrays has been done.
3.Hardcoded set has been removed and Set to be partitioned is instantiated by range() and maximum size of the set is sent by commandline sys.argv. Size of the set to partition is randomly chosen between 1 and maxsize and factorized to get the sides of the rectangle. Lagrangian Four Square Theorem Square Tile Cover reduction for the tile cover of factorized random set rectangle is printed. 
4.This reduction has following phases:
	4.1 Partition a set of random size in SymPy - random histogram

27 March 2020,30 April 2020 - related to 783 and all sections on People Analytics, Compressed Sensing, Intrinsic Merit, Syllable embedding of strings, Hyphenation and Music Pattern Mining
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.NeuronRain AstroInfer already has a Music Recommender Systems implementation based on EMD similarities of Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients but not based on waveforms.
2.Usual Levenshtein Edit Distance is an alphabet based similarity measure while some problems in Name similarity require sophisticated acoustic matching algorithms (e.g NYSIIS, Soundex, Phonetic Match Rating)
3.This commit implements audio_distance() function for 2 audios (whether music or speech waveforms) which extracts waveform arrays of two audio(s) and compares them by Hausdorff distance and Earth Mover Distance which are more quantitative distance measures than edit distance.
4.Such a generic waveform phonetic distance between audios of two text strings is an alternative to Levenshtein Edit Distance. But it requires two human voice audio recordings which spells out the text of two strings (as in IVRs)
5.Syllables are language and script independent phonemes and previous audio_distance() by waveform match theoretically captures syllable phonetics better than edit distance and suits name similarity. Audio waveform match might perform better by spelling out Syllable hyphenated texts than plain texts. Syllable boundary word hyphenation has been implemented earlier for People Analytics and requires syllable to human voice audio transforms.
6.AudioToBitMatrix.py has been upgraded to Python 3.7.5. Logs for the change are at python-src/music_pattern_mining/testlogs/AudioToBitMatrix.log.AudioDistance.27March2020 which compare two similar and different pairs of audio clips of same duration.
7.Intrinsic merit in music is usually associated with creativity/originality of the composer where originality is defined as dissimilarity with works of other composers and similarity between works of self - waveform distance for music approximately captures how dissimilar a music work is from others and common pattern in compositions by self.

816. (THEORY and FEATURE) People Analytics - Human Resource Analytics - Chaotic Hidden Markov Model of Tenures/Attrition - implementation - 
related to 812 - 31 March 2020
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
1.Chaotic Hidden Markov Model of Tenures/Attritions based on Verhulst actuarial logistic has been implemented in a new source file SocialNetworkAnalysis_PeopleAnalytics_ChaoticHMM.py (Python 3.7.5) and SocialNetworkAnalysis_PeopleAnalytics_ChaoticHMM.py.2.7 (Python 2.7)
2.Similar to other Hidden Markov Models for CRF and TextCompression, this implementation is a Python class accepting states(institutions and organizations),observations(including but not limited to domain-designations-remunerations-cities),emission probabilities(probability of an observation in a state),state transition probabilities(probability of switchovers between orgs) and Lambda (constant for Verhulst Logistic)
3.chaotic_HMM_viterbi() function computes the HMM Viterbi algorithm as usual but with a difference in following line of code:
(probability, state) = max((Viterbi[x-1][t]*self.Lambda*self.transition_probabilities[t][y]*(1-self.transition_probabilities[t][y])*self.emission_probabilities[y][self.observations[x]], t) for t in self.states)
which computes the argmax of transition to a state and observation in transitioned state by Verhulst logistic format Lambda*x*(1-x)
4.Probabilities dictionaries have been hardcoded presently in __main__ for invoking Chaotic HMM Viterbi (Lambda=3.7).
5.Example profile of author (overall history of 25 years including academics and work) has been mapped to state transition and observation probabilities (in chronological order - ["Graduation", "AssociateSoftwareEngineer", "MemberTechStaff", "Founder-Architect", "SystemAnalyst", "Specialist", "PostGraduation-ResearchScholar", "Consultant-Architect", "Consultant", "Architect"]) and Viterbi computed is as below which accurately captures the career switches. Still this model considers parallel Tenures as sequential - FOSS initiative of author (Krishna iResearch) from 2003-present has duration of 17 years thus far. Non-major (below 18 years age) graduation in Hindi and schooling have been excluded which increase number of states and observations to 12 from 10 and history to 38 years:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.SocialNetworkAnalysis_PeopleAnalytics_ChaoticHMM.py has been updated to remove hardcoded state transition and emission probabilities (from linkedin profile of author) and to read them from a JSON persistence SocialNetworkAnalysis_PeopleAnalytics_ChaoticHMM.json by json.loads()
2.SocialNetworkAnalysis_PeopleAnalytics_ChaoticHMM.json has been made comprehensive to merge and serialize parallel academic and work tenures - there are multiple parallel academic and work tenures in the example profile making it increasingly difficult to fathom tenure durations because time is parallelized amongst multiple tenures. Parallel tenures are metrics for ability of a profile to multitask. Tensor decomposition of EventNet Causality Logical clock is worth mentioning here which componentizes time - each linear component of time tensor could correspond to a parallel tenure empirically.
3.Parallel tenures are presently simulated by probability distributions - earlier sequential viterbi has been recomputed for parallel tenures  which has multiple non-zero probability states per chronological layer of viterbi trellis and largest probability per layer points to the most prominent state at a time point. Optimal choice of probabilities in JSON are reflected in viterbi and following is an example for parallel tenure traversal from logs testlogs/SocialNetworkAnalysis_PeopleAnalytics_ChaoticHMM.log.8April2020 simulating parallelism:

4. Tenure transitions could also be formalized by weighted automata which has been already implemented in NeuronRain AstroInfer to measure complexity of music notes:
	(tenure1, a, tenure2) - transition from state tenure1 to state tenure2 on symbol a of weight 1
	(tenure2, 2b, tenure3) - transition from state tenure2 to state tenure3 on symbol b of weight 2
Symbols inducing tenure transitions could be any observation (remuneration,designation,location,...) augmented by weight which simulates importance of observation.
5. Complexity of Chaotic HMM and Weighted Automata for tenure transitions of a profile measures unpredictability and merit which is any of the following - parallel tenures, cyclical tenures, academic-work transitions, individual contributions - (corporate and personal initiatives(FOSS)),....

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.ChaosAttractor.py has been changed to create Mandelbrot set sequence by recursively iterating complex logistic map in a separate clause and function arg - "Mandelbrot" - to ChaosPRG(): 
	Z <- Z^2 + C (for seed C)
2.From 629.6 earlier, Mandelbrot set is undecidable due to differing Hausdorff dimensions(1 and 2) which is crucial because Mandelbrot sets are universally found amongst most natural processes (biological, economic-markets, weather, geographic massive datasets) - Undecidability implies there is no halting Turing machine which recognizes language of Bigdata Mandelbrot sets dealing a lethal blow to BigData learnability. 
3.Pseudorandom Mandelbrot sequence generated by previous map Z: Z^2 + C thus is undecidable and a distinguisher Turing machine A (Pr[A(x)=1]-Pr[A(ChaosPRG(seed))=1] >> epsilon where x is a perfect random string in {0,1}^n) which recognizes such a chaotic sequence does not exist too.
4.Example Mandelbrot sequences can be found in testlogs/ChaosAttractor.Mandelbrot.log.13April2020
5.Psuedorandom paper ballot shuffle simulation of Drone Electronic Voting Machine ballots by Chaotic Mandelbrot PRG thus nullifies distinguishability - but yet aforementioned Ramsey theoretic anomaly - "inevitable emergence of order from chaos" - arises: monochromatic arithmetic progressions are still possible in chaotically shuffled multichromatic sequence of votes(if votes are explicitly colored by candidate indices).

1.New function grow_cellular_automaton() has been defined in ChaosAttractor.py which grows an one dimensional binary cellular automaton.
2.ChaosPRG() function accepts four algorithm options - "Logistic","Lehmer-Palmore","Mandelbrot" and "Cellular Automaton".
3.grow_cellular_automaton() function accepts a binary string of 0s and 1s as initialization vector and a random Lambda fraction. 
4.Following simple growth rule has been implemented:
	4.1 Automaton is grown by scanning the two binary digit neighbours of a bit location for four possibilities - 00,10,01,11
	4.2 For each possible neighbourhood, bit location in next generation is updated depending on random value of lambda to 0 or 1

	4.5 Each generation row of 1D binary Cellular Automaton is a Pseudorandom bit sequence
5.States (colors) of the squares in this implementation are binary - 1 or 0 which could be generalized to arbitrary coloring alphabet by defining/reading new growth rules within grow_cellular_automaton() making it a multichromatic space filling. An example rule for 2-dimensional multicolored cellular automata could be Four color theorem - cell and its 8 neighbours are 4-colorable facets; neighbouring faces avoid same color and for successive generations coloring violations might have to be readjusted - Example:

tenure statistics for each linkedin text profile for being compliant to Kaggle linkedin CSV dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/killbot/linkedin) 
which has these fields. Ethnic and physical feature fields have been excluded:
            self.avg_n_pos_per_prev_tenure = 1 
            self.avg_pos_len = float(sum(self.timedeltas))/float(len(self.timedeltas))

3.Each of these tenure variables could be either analyzed as moving average timeseries (kind of martingale because it captures past history) or observations read from JSON in Weighted Automata - Chaotic Hidden Markov Model of Tenures (SocialNetworkAnalysis_PeopleAnalytics_ChaoticHMM.py) - JSON file based on these variables could be dynamically written per linkedin profile and Viterbi is computed.

3. In this commit only first four variables for navigation are being read from socket stream while rest are assumed to have default values. 
4. Code changes for MissionPlan specific to MAVSDK mission-upload, start-mission and arm-takeoff-take_photo have been committed. To simulate a hamiltonian cycle, drone.mission.set_return_to_launch_after_mission(True) has been invoked.
5. awaits for mission progress and observe_is_in_air have been commented.
6. GIS navigation analytics variables read over socket stream are filtered for convex-hull boundaries and mission items are appended accordingly to Mission plan. Every mission item is a delivery point.
7. JMAVSIM and PX4 SITL Logs, Netcat logs for streaming analytics variables and MP4 video of the simulated flight of a drone have been committed as hereunder:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.This code change implements a new function image_segmentation_contours() in ImageGraph_Keras_Theano.py which is exactly similar to contouring code in handwriting_recognition() (DeepLearning_ConvolutionNetwork_BackPropagation.py) for topological handwriting recognition (Product Homotopy) but without distance computation for two imagefiles and finds contour interpolation polynomials for single image. 
2.image_segmentation_contours() has been implemented as a subroutine which is invoked by image_segmentation() and could be used by any other NeuronRain computer vision and Large Scale Visual Recognition analytics code.
3.image_segmentation() earlier had only a computational geometric segmentation of an image for finding component segments and their centroids (GRANA), Delaunay Triangulation and Facegraphs.
4.A-Star motion planning implementation in NeuronRain (Section 866 of NeuronRain Theory Drafts) assumes a graph adjacency matrix and heuristic array signifying estimated cost of obstacle per vertex.
5.Contour detection for GIS imagery is a tool for obstacle avoidance in drone navigation and motion planning. For example, extracting contour  points and its interpolated polynomials from a Road network GIS imagery of a terrain is useful for drawing a Contour graph vertices of which are contour points connected by contour polynomials. Adjacency matrix of such a contour graph could be used in A-Star implementation for Drone navigation. 
6. It is worth observing that 3D-navigation of drones on the edges of road (rail or other transport) network graphs (assuming sufficient vehicle clearance heights greater than grade separators and interchanges for drone altitude) is always obstacle-free because of zero collision (on the contrary driverless vehicles on 2D road networks have non-trivial obstacle avoidance challenge - an optional obstacle avoidance could be to do a VerticalTakeOffLanding (VTOL) for circumventing every obstacle adding a third dimension to surface transport vehicle).
7. An example Road network map from Google Maps has been contour-recognized and following logs and image files illustrate the contour polynomials inferred from road network - by both image_segmentation() and image_segmentation_contours() :

1.Functional MRI datasets (OpenNeuro - https://openneuro.org/public/datasets - earlier OpenFMRI) contain huge volumes of experimental functional MRI data for analyzing connectomes in brain and impact of music on humans (e.g https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000171/versions/00001)
2.Machine Learning has been extensively applied to analyze fMRI data - [Frontiers in Psychology - https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51563375_Functional_Data_Analysis_in_Brain_Imaging_Studies] - by means of which merit of music waveforms could be quantitatively compared for music clustering. NeuronRain already implements automata theoretic and mel-frequency merit measures for music.
3.This code change adds a clause for MRI in medical_imageing() in ImageGraph_Keras_Theano.py and invokes medical_segmentation_contours() to find contours of an example MRI image of brain for different activities.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
1. 3D Navigation of Drones along road network graph airspace (which is theoretically free of natural obstacles) mentioned in 867 requires a webservice which churns out array of GPS ordinates of a road geometry from origin to destination.
2. Google Roads webservice - https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/roads/overview - returns array of snapped GPS ordinate points best fit to a road geometric course between origin and destination.
3. Previous array of GPS ordinates could be looped to create mission items which can be populated to a mission plan and uploaded which is theoretically an obstacle free mission sticking to airspace strip along the road geometry.
4. Obstacle avoidance in 3D (4D including time reckoning relativity for Drone Swarms) thus reduces to finding optimal altitude along the airspace on road geometry
5. Road geometry airspace poses mostly man-made obstacles (flyovers etc.,) and drone altitude must be recomputed for each obstacle (requires interchange/grade-separators structure recognition and their height inference by OpenCV contouring and sensors) or a maximum altitude for drone mission items is set which is greater than all possible man-made structures on a road strip.
6. Groups of Drones (Drone Swarms) and Obstacle avoidance amongst them has increasing applications in combat and tactical ops.

872. (THEORY and FEATURE) Fibonaccian Search - alternative to binary search - related to all sections on Computational Geometric Planar
Point Location Factorization, Geometric Search of BigData, Arithmetic Progressions and Ramsey coloring - 31 October 2020
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Binary Search could be costly in some architectures because of division by 2. Fibonaccian search based on Fibonacci series avoids 
division and depends only on addition and subtraction. Note: Fibonaccian search is different from Fibonacci search to locate maximum of
a unimodal function.
2. Binary search is central to Computational Geometric Factorization to locate a factor point within a segment/interval/pixel-array-polygon which is a sorted arithmetic progression of ordinate products.
3. Fibonaccian search optimization to replace Binary search in planar point location could significantly reduce constant involved in O(logN)
search. 
4. Both Binary search and Fibonaccian search are O(logN) while the search tree of the latter makes the difference - Left subtree of Fibonacci search is 1.618 (Golden ratio) times more skewed than Right subtree.
5. In terms of runtime efficiency Fibonaccian search lies between Binary Search and Interpolation search (which is O(loglogN) and assumes elements are within a known range)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
1.python-src/SocialNetworkAnalysis_PeopleAnalytics.py has been changed to optionally choose between REST API calls to PIPL.com and reading
a json file of people profile from any datasource including PIPL.com by boolean parameter loadfromjson in function pipldotcom_analytics() which reads People data in JSON from testlogs/SocialNetworkAnalysis_PeopleAnalytics.json 
2.JSON objects are multidimensional which could be construed as points on a vectorspace. TensorFlow supports reading JSON format of Tensors as Protobufs (Read JSON string and return a Protobuf Tensor - https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/io/decode_json_example).
3.Mapping people profiles onto Tensor points on vectorspace opens up possibility of whole gamut of Computational geometric People analytics - for example closest pair and clusters of people could be found and profiles could be iteratively ranked to get similarities. 
4.Clustering of people profiles is crucial in analyzing voting patterns. 
5.On a related note, NeuronRain implements a Set partition Electronic Voting Machine and every candidate bucket is a cluster of voters - Distance similarity (or Swing between consecutive polls) between any two Set Partition EVMs is measurable by Earth mover distance (Wasserstein distance).

Embedding in vectorspace, Compressed Sensing, Social Network Analytics, Meaning Representation, Intrinsic Merit of People Profiles/HR Analytics - 15 November 2020
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. CompressedSensing.py has been changed to implement a new function alphabet_vectorspace_embedding_distance(self, embedding1, embedding2) which finds the euclidean distance between two string vector points (1-dimensional Tensor) embedded in alphabet space.
2. It uses the ord() builtin to compute ordinal values of the ascii or unicode strings. 
3. alphabet_vectorspace_embedding_distance() is invoked from python-src/SocialNetworkAnalysis_PeopleAnalytics.py to compare two different name spellings in English of a Sanskrit name. 
4. Strings of different lengths are left justified and padded by "#" fill before distance computation.
5. Distance computed is normalized - divided by length of the strings compared. 
6. Logs python-src/testlogs/SocialNetworkAnalysis_PeopleAnalytics.log.15November2020 show distance similarities amongst different name spellings in English of Sanskrit name which can be contrasted against Phonetic match rating and NYSIS Flight manifest name similarity algorithms as below:
embedding1: ['S', 'h', 'r', 'i', 'n', 'i', 'v', 'a', 's', '#', '#', '#']
embedding2: ['S', 'h', 'r', 'i', 'n', 'i', 'v', 'a', 'a', 's', 'a', 'n']
Alphabet Vectorspace Embedding Distance between  ['S', 'h', 'r', 'i', 'n', 'i', 'v', 'a', 's', '#', '#', '#']  and  ['S', 'h', 'r', 'i', 'n', 'i', 'v', 'a', 'a', 's', 'a', 'n'] : 127.251719045363

7.Invocation of Recursive Lambda Function Growth Meaning Representation of a Professional Profile and Email context name parsing have been uncommented. Because of unfiltered proper nouns of organizations, few lambda functions are misleading.
8.Two phonetically different name spellings "Rasa" and "Raja" of same name (in Tamizh and Sanskrit respectively) are compared for euclidean distance similarity.
9.Syllable Hyphenation of name strings adds one more dimension and would create a 2-dimensional tensor embedding and distance between two 2D tensors could be more accurate e.g:
	"Srinivasan" - [[S,r,i,n,i],[v,a,s,a,n]]
	"Shrinivas" - [[S,h,r,i,n,i],[v,a,s]]
	"Shrinivaasan" - [[S,h,r,i,n,i],[v,a,a,s,a,n]]
10.For arbitrary dimensional people data as JSON tensors which include name,work experience,connections,academics etc., distance computation between Person1 and Person2 requires expanding dimensions of smaller tensor and computing the norm of Person1 - Person2 (Stackoverflow question - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55196194/how-to-calculate-the-euclidean-distance-between-a-2-d-tensor-and-a-3-d-tensor)

876. (THEORY and FEATURE) People Analytics - People profiles as Tensors - Chaotic Hidden Markov Model of Tenure Transitions - TensorFlow

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.This commit invokes TensorFlow convert_to_tensor() function for converting any People profile data encoded as any Python object including JSON to a Tensor.
2.python-src/SocialNetworkAnalysis_PeopleAnalytics_ChaoticHMM.py which models tenure transitions of People profiles by Chaotic Hidden Markov Model Viterbi Trellis,now imports TensorFlow and TensorFlow I/O.
3.SocialNetworkAnalysis_PeopleAnalytics_ChaoticHMM.json Tenure Transition is read and the fields are converted to Tensors by convert_to_json() TensorFlow API e.g tenure organizations - academic and work - are encoded as TF tensor below:
	piplprofiletensor - states: tf.Tensor(
	[b'Schooling' b'DBHPS' b'PSGTech' b'BaaN-SSAGlobal'
	 b'SunMicrosystems-Oracle' b'Krishna-iResearch' b'Verizon'
  	 b'webMethods-SoftwareAG' b'CMI-IIT-IMSc' b'GlobalAnalytics'
	 b'Clockwork-PiQube' b'CloudEnablers'], shape=(12,), dtype=string)
4.TensorFlow function decode_as_json() might also be invoked but there are occassional JSON parsing errors.
5.Objective of NeuronRain People Analytics is to automate, do away with or minimize human errors in talent recruitment through machine learning models. Stability and Noise Sensitivity criterion of an interview TQBF/LTF/PTF derived earlier theoretically stipulates when a talent recruitment system by Question-Answering is better than majority voting and thus has enormous HR analytics ramifications. Goodness of majority voting - when group decision converges to good outcome for p-biased voters - is limited by Margulis-Ruzzo Threshold/Condorcet-Black-Ladha Jury Theorems for p-biased boolean functions. Combining the two, Stability criterion for interview TQBF (which is in IP=PSPACE) outclassing majority decision and Margulis-Ruzzo/CJT threshold for majority decision converging to 100% are thus inversely related - if Questions-Answers are improperly weighted (a <= 1.2056205488/n) for every possible LTF, Interview process is subverted and becomes unstable making BKS Conjecture False.

This commit refactors EventNet/EventNet.py to define EventNet_Tensor_Parser() function which parses the EventNet Vertices and Edges text files and instantiates TensorFlow Tensor objects for each intraevent conversations (edges amongst actors in an event) and a holistic EventNet TensorFlow Tensor for interevent causality. EventNet abstraction helps analyzing Videos - each Frame is an Event, actor objects within a Frame event category interact by morphisms (intraevent) and Causality between Frames (interevent) is defined by edges or Functors between two Frame Event categories. More than anything else, EventNet conceptualizes a multidimensional logical time Tensor and postulates that time tensor could be decomposed to components. EventNet example has been redrawn by GraphViz and testlogs/EventNet.Tensor.log.20November2020 capture the EventNet Tensor instantiated as TensorFlow tf.Tensor() objects.

1.This commit augments CompressedSensing.py - alphabet_vectospace_embedding_distance() function to optionally compute syllable vector earth mover distance between two phonetic syllable hyphenated string 2D tensors (encoded by ordinal integers) by syllable_tensor_distance boolean flag
2.Lot of options were tried for computing distance norm between two 2D tensors having arbitrary number of rows and columns of unequal lengths - TensorFlow, sklearn, SciPy directed_hausdorff, wasserstein_distance and cdist, OpenCV2 EMD - and OpenCV2 EMD has been chosen because of its implicit dimension expansion, support for unequal rows and columns between two 2D tensors (which is very much necessary for comparing two strings of unequal number of syllables of arbitray length) and ability to measure syllables as histograms - syllables partition a string to histogram buckets and distance between two strings is the amount of work necessary to move one string syllable histogram to another (2D analogue of Edit Distance) which is captured by Earth Mover Distance of OpenCV. 
3.Function tosig() translates a syllable hyphenation of string to OpenCV.EMD() format.
4.Logs at python-src/testlogs/SocialNetworkAnalysis_PeopleAnalytics.log.27November2020  compute EMD between following string syllable hyphenations:
 csensing.alphabet_vectorspace_embedding_distance([['n','o'], ['m','i'],['n','a','l']], [['s','e'], ['m','i'],['n','a','l']],True)

1.GraphMining_GSpan Python implementation has been upgraded to Python 3.7 by autopep8 and 2to3-3.7 utilities.
2.New function GraphEditDistance() has been defined in GSpan class which takes two NetworkX Graph objects as arguments and computes
 exact Graph Edit Distance (NP-Hard) by graph_edit_distance() and approximations by optimize_edit_paths() and optimize_graph_edit_distance()
NetworkX APIs.
3.Logs in python-src/testlogs/GraphMining_GSpan.GraphEditDistance.log.9December2020 capture the GSpan Graph mining for some example TextGraphs (Recursive Gloss Overlap algorithm) and Graph Edit Distance for two example numeric labelled graphs.
4.GraphEditDistance() could be invoked from any Graph analytics implementation in NeuronRain for Similar Graph clustering viz., Social network graphs, FaceGraphs (Delaunay triangles and Voronoi facets) of Segmented images(Pattern recognition, GIS, Urban Sprawls), TextGraphs, Economic networks, Program Slice Graphs, FTrace kernel callgraphs, Userspace Valgrind/KCacheGrind/Callgrind callgraphs, Control Flow Graphs et al.
5.Graph Edit Distance for Audios (Speech) assumes a hypothetical AudioNet similar to ImageNet dataset or Speech-to-Text engine for eliciting graph structure in speech though Music as a graph is vague to define, but NeuronRain music pattern mining learns a weighted automata from musical clips which are directed graphs of state transitions labelled by heptatonic western classical notes (CDEFGABC).
6.Classical Indian music has 72 fundamental notes patterns and many derivatives from them.

1. Recursive Lambda Function Growth Meaning Representation was inferring some misleading lambda functions related to the proper noun
dictionary-filtered profile contents - Word "Architect" was incorrectly disambiguated to civil engineering and produced lemmas - "slab",
"home_plate", "base_ball" et al.
2. This was perhaps because of deficiencies of NLTK lesk implementation. Changing to PyWSD significantly slows down and there are WordNet
errors within PyWSD. This has necessitated reverting to NeuronRain Lesk Word Sense Disambiguation function best_matching_synset() and 
both NLTK and PyWSD disambiguation have been disabled. 
3. NeuronRain WSD best_matching_synset() has extracted quite accurate synset lemmas which have been used to create TextGraph and Graph Tensor Neural Network Lambda functions are grown from Random walks and Cycles on this new TextGraph - TextGraph for best_matching_synset() is much different from those of NLTK/PyWSD Lesk functions.

1.NeuronRain People Analytics is mainly about automating the process of recruiting talent by minimizing or obviating human error and intervention.
2.Theoretically if intrinsic merit lowerbounds fame, automatic recruitment is feasible which has been analyzed in earlier relevant sections. In this commit, profile parser function has been updated to include a domain specific dictionary argument which contains fields specific to a work domain - IT, Manufacturing, Academics etc.,
3.For Information Technology domain, example dictionary has two fields (values) - "name" (Information Technology) and "opensource_sloc" (Number of Source Lines of Code contributed to OpenSource products). Domain of IT is quite different from other industries in the sense work experience and technical wherewithal is quantifiable by lines of code and arbitrary number of clones can be derived from digital content which is impossible in other disciplines.
4.Technical Talent in Information Technology domain is measurable quantitatively by number of lines of code written which is used in various opensource codebase analyzers (e.g OpenHub COCOMO analyzer) and software complexity metrics (e.g Function Point Analysis).
5.Total experience of a profile is weighted by opensource_sloc value (which is at present just a linear addition function but could be any other) for least energy intrinsic merit of a profile which is the single largest crucial parameter more important than mere tenure duration for automatic recruitment in Information Technology domain and more intrinsic than Majority Voting (which suffers from limitations of Condorcet Jury Theorem) and manual processes of Interview (which is subject to BKS Conjecture and human error).
6.If Novelty Detection measures (e.g Patents) and SLOC measures per proprietary and opensource products of organizations are accumulated and weighted it could further augment the previous merit statistic.
7.Spark Version has been upgraded to 3.0.1 (based on Hadoop 3.2) for LinkedIn Dataset Analytics.

1128. (THEORY and FEATURE) People Analytics - HR and Talent Analytics - Chaotic Hidden Markov Model - Career Transition Score of a Profile -
Weighted Automaton of Career Transition - related to 753, 1127 and all sections on People Analytics, Intrinsic Merit Versus Fame Equilibrium, BKS Conjecture, Stability of Interview LTF/PTF - 23 December 2020
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. This commit implements an important and most fundamental merit measure for People profiles - Career Transition Score - which quantifies and grades the career tenure switchovers of a Professional profile by traversing designations/paygrades in a Career Transition Weighted Automaton State Machine.
2. Section 753 attributes following qualities to career transition ranked by incentivizing choices made:
	" ...
	(*) transition from industry to academics is considered nobler than industry-to-industry.
	(*) transition from academics to industry is majority choice 
	(*) transition from low remuneration to high is a majority choice 
	(*) transition from high remuneration to low is rare
	(*) transition from employment to entrepreneur is rare and considered less risk-averse
	(*) transition from low designation to high is majority choice
	... "
3.SocialNetworkAnalysis_PeopleAnalytics_ChaoticHMM.py defines a new function career_transition_analytics() which traverses the Observations
of the Chaotic Hidden Markov Model,classifies them into states and looksup the state transitions in a predefined Weighted Automaton defined by a dictionary:
	self.career_statemachine={'academic-academic':2,'work-work':1,'startup-startup':2,'academic-work':1,'work-academic':2,'academic-start
up':3,'startup-academic':3,'work-startup':3,'startup-work':1,'academic-business':5,'business-business':6} 
4.Previous career state machine presently has 4 classes of designations for states - academic, work, startup (which includes own initiatives of a profile) and business (corporate designations) - and transitions among them are weighted by integers in ascending order of importance and risk aversion. E.g Transition work-work is weighted as 1 which is considered secure while business-business is weighted as 6 because of high risk. 
5.Designations (Observations in HMM) are classified into 4 classes above - academic,startup,business,work - and weighted by increased paygrades/power/independence/authority/experience/totempole:
	self.designations["academic"]={"Schooling":1,"Graduation":2,"PostGraduation":3,"PostGraduation-ResearchScholar":4}
        self.designations["startup"]={"Founder-Architect":7}
        self.designations["business"]={'CEO':10,'CTO':9,'CFO':8}
        self.designations["work"]={"AssociateSoftwareEngineer":1, "MemberTechStaff":2, "SystemAnalyst":3, "Specialist":4, "Consultant-Archite
ct":6, "Consultant":5, "Architect":6}
6.More predefined designations, classes of designations and state transitions could be added to previous dictionaries which might be optionally read from a persisted NoSQL datastore.
7.Observations of Career Chaotic Hidden Markov Model are traversed and weights per state transition and corresponding observation are summed to get a Career Transition Score of a profile which intrinsically rates merit of a profile based on predefined weights. 
8.Industry has been divided into startup (for MSMEs, private initiatives) and business (for management profiles of Corporates, Bellwether, Blue Chips, Big Fishes) for weighting the risk.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.This commit implements 3 new functions in python-src/SocialNetworkAnalysis_PeopleAnalytics_ChaoticHMM.py - career_polynomial_inner_product_distance(),normalize(),second() - and polynomial fit of weighted HMM observations (designations) in career_transition_analytics()
2.career_polynomial_inner_product_distance() takes two arrays of points on a polynomial (of same size sampled on similar time points which could be numeric values for designations,remunerations or durations), polyfit()-s the points to two polynomials and computes inner product of the two polynomials which is the clustering similarity measure for two people profiles.
3.second() is a  utility function for getting the second element in an array of ordered tuples. Usual cast of array of ordered tuple to dict() and invoking values() on them returns unique values and not a multiset of repetitive values which is redressed by second(). 
4.Utility Function normalize() divides a numeric array by maximum element which might be necessary for comparing trends in remunerations,designations and durations of two talent profiles.
5.Apart from these, weighted observations (designations) within Chaotic HMM are as well fitted to a polynomial in career_transition_analytics()
6.All polynomials are of degree 5 and logs testlogs/SocialNetworkAnalysis_PeopleAnalytics_ChaoticHMM.log.30December2020 demonstrate the inner product distance measures and fitted career polynomials through few example inputs.

1. SocialNetworkAnalysis_PeopleAnalytics.py implementation has been updated to compare Earth Mover Distance and Wagner-Fischer Edit distance.
2. Few debug print()s have been added to print EMD and Edit distance measures for 2 strings. EMD computes the Earth Mover Distance between
 histograms of 2 strings.
3. Each string histogram has single alphabet buckets which reduces Edit Distance to Earth Mover Distance and subquadratic Earth Mover Distance
computation (e.g LC-ACT linear complexity approximation of EMD has high accuracy close to 100% depending on iterations) implies SETH is False.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Transformers attention model implementation in NeuronRain could be used for Named Entity Recognition and Machine Translation.
2.Attention of a word vertex wi to word vertex wj in text graph from Recursive Gloss Overlap and Recursive Lambda Function Growth algorithms is heuristically inverse-proportional to degree of the vertex wj - extent to which meaning of the word vertex wj depends on wi.
3.Transformer attention model learns Query weights (Q), Key weights (K), Value weights (V) for embedding xi for word i defined by:
	Qi = xi * qi
	Ki = xi * ki
	Vi = xi * vi
	Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(Q * K^T/sqrt(d^k))*V, d^k = dimension of Keys vector
	a(i,j) = attention of word i to word j = qi * kj
	softmax(xi) = e^xi/Sigma(e^xj) which normalizes sum to 1
4.Every word vertex of the text graph could be embedded in a vectorspace by word2vec and from previous transformer attention model:
	attention of word vertex wi to word vertex wj in text graph = a(wi,wj) = proportional to (1/degree(wj)) = qi * kj
5.New function rlfg_transformers_attention_model() has been implemented in RecursiveLambdaFunctionGrowth.py which computes degree of every word vertex in a text definition graph, derives degree attention matrix from them and learns Query weights, Key weights and Value weights from degree based attentions of the word vertices of text graph by Gradient Descent.
6.Product of learnt query and key weights yields the exact attention values between word vertices wi and wj.
7.Transformer Gradient Descent implementation in NeuronRain GRAFIT has been imported and invoked.

1135.1.LC-ACT (Algorithm 3) in IBM Research paper on LC-RWMD has 2 nested loops (for and argmin) for variables p (size of histogram1) and q (size of histogram2) as quoted below:
	Algorithm 3 Approximate Computation of ICT
	1: function ACT(p, q, C, k)
	2: t = 0 ⊲ initialize transportation cost t
	3: for i = 1 . . . , hp do ⊲ iterate the indices of p
	4: 	s = argmink (Ci,[1...hq]) ⊲ find top-k smallest
	5: 	l = 1 ⊲ initialize l
	6: 	while l < k do
	7: 		r = min(pi , qs[l]) ⊲ size of max. transfer
	8: 		pi = pi − r ⊲ move r units of pi to qs[l]
	9: 		t = t + r · Ci,j ⊲ update cost
	10: 		l = l + 1 ⊲ increment l
	11: 	end while
	12: 	if pi != 0 then ⊲ if pi still has some mass
	13: 		t = t + pi · Ci,s[k] ⊲ move the rest to qs[k]
	14: 	end if
	15: end for
	16: return t ⊲ return transportation cost t
	17: end function
1135.2.Bottom left constant size quadrant rectangle of Edit distance memoization table hence computes edit distances of constant size substring histograms of 1-alphabet buckets. Example edit distance table from https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs124/lec/med.pdf is quoted below:
	N 9 8 9 10 11 12 11 10 9 8
	O 8 7 8 9 10 11 10 9 8 9
	I 7 6 7 8 9 10 9 8 9 10
	T 6 5 6 7 8 9 8 9 10 11
	N 5 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 10
	E 4 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 9
	T 3 4 5 6 7 8 7 8 9 8
	N 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 7 8 7
	I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 6 7 8
	# 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
	  # E X E C U T I O N
1135.3 In previous example, constant quadrant could be the bottom left 4*4 square fragment of the table computed by LC-ACT in linear time while the rest of the table adheres to conventional quadratic recurrence:
	T 3 4 5 6 
        N 2 3 4 5
        I 1 2 3 4
        # 0 1 2 3
          # E X E	 
1135.4.Algorithm 3 for LC-ACT has histogram sizes p,q and iterations k as arguments. Therefore Algorithm 3 runs in predefined constant linear time for constant size quadrant of edit distance table - Iterations variable k could be appropriately predetermined for constants p and q of histogram sizes - For 100% accuracy iterations depend on string histogram sizes p and q. Each pi and qs have sizes <= 1 because string histograms have buckets of 1 alphabet.
1135.5.Thus a fraction of edit distance dynamic programming is performed in linear time. This reduces the exponent of quadratic time edit distance computation from 2 to 1.99999... or less asymptotically depending on constant size quadrant which implies edit distance is subquadratic and SETH is false.
1135.6.Constant size quadrant fraction of edit distance dynamic programming table of sides x and y has maximum distance computation d(x,y) in top right corner of the constant quadrant for 2 string histograms of lengths x and y equivalent to edit distance between 2 strings of lengths x and y - this assumes LC-ACT distances for string histograms are directly proportional to integral edit distances between strings of those histograms. In previous example fragment d(#INT,#EXE) = 6 for x=4 and y=4.
1135.7.Thus x and y are the maximum constant values for 2 nested loops of string histograms of size p and q (x=p, y=q).
1135.8.Constant number of iterations k in LC-ACT could be found once in initialization phase for constant values p=x and q=y and used as constant upperbound for all computations of distances within the constant sized quadrant rectangle.
1135.9.LC-ACT depends only on lengths p,q of string histograms and iterations k.
1135.10.Edit distance table grows from bottom left to top right. Therefore LC-ACT optimization works only for a constant sized rectangle in bottom left of the table, where constant length substring distances are computed.
1135.11 For string histograms, each bucket has only one alphabet and number of iterations (k) required is only 1 from LC-ACT algorithm 3 earlier (lines 7 to 10) because r <= 1 which is a major runtime reduction - at most one alphabet could be moved from bin of p to bin of q.
1135.12 Complexity of data parallel LC-ACT implementation (Table 3 of 1135.14) is O(vhm + nhk) where v = size of vocabulary, h = average size of the string histograms, m = dimension of the coordinates, n = number of string histograms, k = iterations.
1135.13 For Edit distance - Earth mover distance reduction, n = 1 (for distance between pair of string histograms), m = 1 (because each bin has only one alphabet) and k = 1 (because only one alphabet is moved) which implies the Complexity of LC-ACT edit distance computation is O(vh + h) which is linear in average size of the string histograms (or) linear in average length of the strings if size of the vocabulary v is constant (ASCII or Unicode) and thus subquadratic implying SETH is false and previous constant quadrant optimization could be unnecessary on the average.

1136. (THEORY and FEATURE) SETH is 100% False - Draft Proof - alternative Edit distance-Earth mover distance reduction - related to 752,1135 and all sections on Earth Mover Distance, Edit Distance, BigData and String analytics, String complexity measures, Histogram analytics, Merit of Large Scale Visuals, Embedding of Strings in Syllable vector space - 24 March 2021, 11 April 2021
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1136.1 As alternative to 1 alphabets per bin, every String histogram has buckets containing ASCII or Unicode numeric values of alphabet as numeric weights. This makes string histograms more similar to traditional histograms having bins of numeric weights e.g. Image Pixel Histograms of Large Scale Visuals.
1136.2 LC-ACT is thus readily applicable to string histograms of numeric weights. Direct proportionality assumption between edit distance values and earth mover distance values stated earlier in 1135 has to be proved.
1136.3 For same strings both edit distance and earth mover distance are zero. For dissimilar strings edit distance inserts alphabets, deletes alphabets and updates alphabets while previous numeric weights string histogram for earth mover distance depends on r and C(i,j) - r and C(i,j) increase with widening numeric weights (differing alphabets) - Edit distance counts only insertions, deletions and substitutions while EMD generalizes edit distance.
1136.4 Because there is not much literature on relation between edit distance and earth mover distance (except L1-embeddings which exist for all classes of distance metrics) following equation in 1136.5 has been contrived for proving proportionality between former and latter inspired by edit distance dynamic programming recurrence:
	Edit distance =	minimum(d(i-1,j-1),d(i-1,j) + delete(ai),d(i,j-1) + insert(bj),d(i-1,j-1) + substitute(ai,bj))
1136.5 Earth Mover Distance = w1*Sum(unicode values of inserted alphabets) - w2*Sum(unicode values of deleted alphabets) + w3*Sum(difference between unicode values of substituted alphabets)
1136.6 Previous linear program sums unicode values of inserted alphabets in string histogram bins, subtracts unicode values of deleted alphabets in string histogram bins, sums the difference between unicode values of substituted alphabets in string histogram bins by assigning appropriate weights which is same as lines 7-10 of LC-ACT data parallel algorithm earlier.
1136.7 Instead of 1s for counting insertions, deletions and substitutions, unicode value weights of the string histogram bins are used which maps edit distance to earth mover distance - iterated summation of r (=difference between weights of bins in 2 histograms) * C(i,j) (=cost).
1136.8 Replacing unicode weights by 1s reverts EMD to Edit distance. Number of iterations of LC-ACT is upperbounded by total number of alphabet encodings e.g. 256 for ASCII, 512 for Unicode - for numeric string histograms which is again constant and thus linear time and accuracy is 100%.
1136.9 An example computation of LC-ACT algorithm - lines 7-10:
For pi = 3 (unicode weight) and qs = 1 (unicode weight), r = min(3,1) = 1. If C(i,j) is 1 uniformly throughout:
pi - r = 3 - 1 = 2 (iteration 1), t = 1
pi - r = 2 - 1 = 1 (iteration 2), t = 2
1136.10 Edit distance to Earth mover distance reduction could be useful as well for (*) computing distance between syllable hyphenated natural language strings in which each string is a histogram of bins containing syllables  (*) and stream of Survival Index WCET OS Scheduler Histograms in which timeslice bins are process id strings.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Condorcet Jury Theorem and its later refinements  formalize goodness of majority voting function allowing voter error. Bounded probabilistic
polynomial time Turing Machine (BPP) accepts YES instances (x in L) with probability > 2/3 and rejects NO instances with probability < 1/3
(x not in L). Bounded error majority voting Turing machine with p-bias < 1/2 (voter has bounded rationality and errs < 50% while choosing a candidate) converges to 1 for infinite electorate by CJT and its variants implying P=BPP for infinite majority voting - BPP majority voting Turing machine elects a good candidate xi from input vector x of candidates by gathering votes vector v from infinite number of voters with probability ~1 if xi in L (Good) or rejects with probability ~0 otherwise by Condorcet Jury Theorem. In the context of intrinsic merit of an entity, infinite voters having p-bias < 1/2 (low error) increasingly reach consensus on perceived merit - intrinsic merit and perceived merit coincide. Previous BPP majority voting Turing machine is depth-1 majority and does not compose boolean functions. Depth-2 majority function composes majority and individual voter SATs (boolean for binary or non-boolean for multipartisan) of arbitrary complexity class. For example, Majority * BPP denotes a composition of boolean majority with Voter functions of BPP where every voter function is a BPP machine which decides correctly with > 2/3 probability (p-bias < 1/2) implying outcome of voting tends to 100% correctness for infinite number of voters (but polynomial e.g number of voters x^1000000000000 is polynomial though huge). BPP is low for itself => BPP^BPP = BPP and if Majority * BPP could be alternatively formalized as oracle machine BPP^BPP then depth-2 majority is in BPP and by CJT, voting tends to 100% goodness for infinite number of voters and BPP is derandomized to P. Previous Majority * BPP boolean composition is in KRW conjecture - Communication complexity regime. P=BPP does not imply P=NP and thus hardness amplification (and separation of P from NP) is not contradicted though converse P=NP implies P=BPP. As an aside, Edit distance to Earth mover distance reduction earlier applies to theoretical set partition voting machine histograms defined and implemented in NeuronRain if votes in histogram bins are encoded as strings. Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem implies no voting system for more than 2 candidates is manipulation free thus implying non-boolean majority functions (boolean majority is restricted to 2 candidates) are always in Probabilistic complexity classes. There is a curious Ramsey theoretic aside to plurality (multipartisan) democracy (Refer: Plurality CJT - 740.5) - Incumbent change after every 4 or 5 years by periodic electoral processes (or less under extraordinary circumstances) could be written as integer sequence colored by incumbents - illustration:
	Infinite sequence of Dispensations of durations 4-5 years are numbered d1,d2,d3,d4,... which are colored by Finite sequence of incumbents i1,i2,i3,...,in. 
	For 3 parties, i1,i2,i3 - d1(i1),d2(i1),d3(i1),d4(i2),d5(i3),d6(i1),d7(i2),d8(i2),d9(i1),d10(i3),... is a 3-coloring of first 10 dispensations of infinite sequence by 3 incumbents.
	Number of monochromatic subsequences of length > m is a measure of voter displeasure. Higher the number of longer monochromatic subsequences, Less dissatisfied are the voters.
	d1(i1),d2(i1),d3(i1),d4(i1),d5(i2),d6(i2),d7(i2),d8(i2),.... is a stabler incumbency (voters stick to their choice longer) than
	d1(i1),d2(i2),d3(i1),d4(i2),d5(i1),d6(i2),d7(i1),d8(i2),.... implying mercurial voting pattern in the latter (importunate voters who switch their preferences often) - typical anti-incumbency syndrome
	From Infinite Pigeonhole Principle, every infinite sequence which is finitely colored has an infinite monochromatic subsequence implying there is a possibility of single party rule for indefinite period of time in plural democracy (perhaps an evidence of Gibbard-Satterthwaite impossibility no-go theorem for plural democracies).
	There is a correspondence between Voter loyalty in democracy and Brand loyalty (marketing) - Brand loyalties could be considered as votes by consumers to brands - Double jeopardy is a phenomenon in which low market share brands have few takers and high loyalty attrition. On similar lines low vote share parties are less coveted by populi.

1138. (THEORY and FEATURE) Recursive Lambda Function Growth Textgraph as EventNet Causality Graphical Event Model - implementation -
12 April 2021 - related to 762 and all sections on Intrinsic Merit of Text and Videos, EventNet, Graphical Event Models 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.New python source file RecursiveLambdaFunctionGrowth_EventNetGEM.py derived from  RecursiveLambdaFunctionGrowth.py implements
function rlfg_eventnet_graphical_event_model() which takes a Recursive Lambda Function Growth WordNet textgraph as argument and computes all pairs shortest paths between word vertices from textgraph.
2.All pairs shortest paths in the textgraph are filtered for words of verb part-of-speech and top core number words of dense subgraph unsupervised classifier - rationale being paths between word vertices containing lot of verb vertices are approximate chronology and causality indicators of actors and actions while words of top core numbers are keywords of the text - "who does what to whom".
3.This EventNet causality model for texts (mostly news articles) is inspired by EventNet Tensor product algorithm implementation for Merit of Large Scale Visuals which determines causality between frames of video by ImageNet.
4.Textgraph of an example news article is filtered for verb paths - some exceprts from testlogs/RecursiveLambdaFunctionGrowth_EventNetGEM.log.12April2021:
['government', 'unit', 'density', 'size', 'add', 'make', 'propose', 'proposal', 'intention', 'usually', 'area', 'urban', 'city', 'Chennai', 'Tamil', 'Dravidian']
['government', 'unit', 'density', 'size', 'add', 'make', 'propose', 'proposal', 'intention', 'usually', 'area', 'urban', 'city', 'Chennai', 'Tamil', 'language']
['influence', 'extend', 'expand']
5.Existing Graphical Event Models viz, PGEM extract graph dependency from timeseries of events by probabilistic maximum likelihood parent search while previous algorithm is graph theoretic. Start and/or end vertices of paths are (actors) nouns while most intermediary nodes are (actions) verbs.

(Is the 2019 novel coronavirus related to a spike of cosmic rays? - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7529058/) and a 
textgraph created by it is analyzed for random walk causality (having noun-verb-noun patterns fitting actor-action-actor cause-effect

[As an astronomical aside 2 peak waves of COVID19 tantalizingly coincided with 2 notable celestial conjunctions of planets in December 2019 and February 2021 apart from Solar eclipses in 2019 and 2020 (which are known for malevolent radiations) and an abnormal comet passing tangential to earth (Borisov 2019)]

...
3.Nested loop for verb filtering has been optimized.
4.Recursive Lambda Function Growth EventNet GEM textgraph is particularly useful when two different seemingly unrelated research articles are collated (their texts are merged) and textgraph from merged text is analyzed for actor-action-actor causality random walks. This could prove hidden connections between hitherto unrelated fields of research.

1142. (THEORY and FEATURE) SETH is 100% False - Draft Proof - Edit distance-Earth mover distance reduction and order preservation - illustration - related to 752,1135,1136 and all sections on Earth Mover Distance, Edit Distance, BigData and String analytics, String complexity measures, Histogram analytics and Set partitions, Merit of Large Scale Visuals, Embedding of Strings in Syllable vector space - 26 May 2021, 11 July 2021
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1142.1 Earth mover distance - Edit distance reduction preserves order of bins in histograms because histograms are usually set partitions of
a numeric range on x-axis (or y-axis) and thus order of alphabets in a string and order of single alphabet buckets in string histograms are same.
1142.2 Single alphabet buckets of string histogram therefore are order preserving and Earth Mover distance and Edit distance are equivalent and directly proportional (Insertion of an alphabet = Insertion of new single alphabet bucket, Deletion of an alphabet = Removal of single alphabet bucket, Update of an alphabet = Update of single alphabet bucket)
1142.3 For string histograms of numeric ASCII or Unicode values for each 1-alphabet bucket, the order preservation is obvious - each bucket has size equal to ASCII or Unicode value of the alphabet.
1142.4 Following illustration depicts Earth mover distance to Edit distance reduction between two string histograms for strings "acdfp" and "qdpfg" (each bin has size equal to ASCII or Unicode values of the alphabet):
	
			String histogram1 ("acdfp")   ===== morphed to =====>	String histogram2 ("qdpfg")

			a ##############					q #################	
			c ######						d ########
			d ########						p #####
			f ##########						f #######
			p ####							g #########

1142.5 Earth Mover Distance (EMD) - Edit Distance (ED) reduction is immediate for numeric string histograms because transportation of bin weights in LC-ACT - Algorithm 3, lines 7-10 - (which are differences in ASCII or Unicode values of the bins) changes ASCII or Unicode values between strings morphing one string to another (Example iterations in 1136.9) - direct proportionality is by linear program earlier.
1142.6 Previous illustration envisions an alternative spectacle to view a string - every string is a numeric set partition of sum of ASCII or Unicde values of constituent alphabets and thus edit distance between strings is equivalent to distance between numeric ASCII or Unicode set partitions which unusually relates String complexity and Theory of partitions. Two way reduction between Edit Distance and Earth Mover Distance for previous numeric string histogram illustration in essence is as follows:
1142.7 Edit distance to Earth mover distance direction: Replace the 1s in dynamic program for edit distance by unicode or ASCII value of the alphabet inserted,deleted and difference of the unicode or ASCII values for substituted alphabets (#ins-del-sub)
1142.8 Earth mover distance to Edit distance direction: In LC-ACT transportation algorithm, replace addition and subtraction of r by fraction of unicode or ASCII value moved between histograms of strings e.g if ASCII or unicode value of a string histogram bin is 100 and r=25, replace steps 7,8,9 of LC-ACT algorithm involving r by 25/100 = 0.25. After 4 iterations when bin is emptied, whole alphabet is moved and fraction is 4 * 0.25=1.0 which simulates increment by 1 in dynamic programming recursion (#ins-del-sub) for edit distance.
1142.9 Rubik's cube version of edit distance: Diameter of Rubik's Cube group Cayley graph has been shown to be 20 or less (or) a solution could be reached on Rubik's cube from any permutation in 20 or less half turn moves - https://tomas.rokicki.com/rubik20.pdf. By replacing colors of Rubik's cube faces with ASCII or Unicode values of a string, every half turn move on Rubik's Cube maps to a colored configuration vertex on Cayley graph of Rubik's Cube group - every half turn move on Rubik's cube leads to a permuted shuffle of a string (of length 9 if every square on a face is a letter) . Rubik's Cube bound has huge implications for Edit distance and Earth Mover Distance of Strings: Coloring faces of Rubik's cube by natural language letters implies any string of length 9 (concatenation of letters on a face of Rubik's cube) can be reached from any other string of length 9 in 20 or less delete-update-insert operations (half-turn moves) and Edit distance (from Earth Mover Distance to Edit distance histogram reduction illustration earlier) is subquadratic (either linear time or constant) for strings of length 9 (quadratic time is 81 moves). From https://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.5736.pdf (God's Algorithm for arbitrary Rubik's cube), diameter of Cayley graph for arbitrary size Rubik's Cube (n*n*n) is theta(n^2/logn) - God's Number - implying any length n string is editable to any other length n string (by half turn moves) in subquadratic time of theta(n^2/logn) which is Rubik's cube version of Edit distance (For length 9 strings, number of moves is 9*9/log9 ~= 81/3.16 ~= 26) and subquadratic edit distance computation implies SETH is False if every half turn move is of constant time. Length of a string N on face of a n*n*n Rubik's cube is N=n^2 (concatenation of n^2 Unicode values) and God's algorithm for arbitrary Rubik's cube requires O(N/log(sqrt(N)) time to edit any string of length N to another string of length N through sequence of halfturn moves which is sublinear bettering LC-ACT. Usual natural language vocabulary has size less than million while number of all possible string permutations on a 3*3*3 Rubik's cube is 43 quintillion and permutations on n*n*n Rubik's cube could be astronomically high.

1139 and all sections of Intrinsic Merit, EventNet Causal and Graphical Event Models - 8 June 2021
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.RecursiveLambdaFunctionGrowth_EventNetGEM.py has been executed on merged abstracts of 2 different research articles on Collatz conjecture and Pseudorandom number generators (but both are indirectly related to Chaotic maps and Fractals) - https://www.math.auckland.ac.nz/~king/745/collatz.pdf and https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332583614_Pseudo-random_number_generators_based_on_the_Collatz_conjecture - which reasonably extracts the crux of the two articles and finds random walks connecting the abstracts.
2.There are some irrelevant word vertices which could be because of deficient word sense ambiguation (Primitive Lesk and PyWSD) and non-scientific nature of WordNet which is more linguistic and might therefore necessitate a Concept Ontology specific to Theoretical and Experimental Science.
3.Cause-effect random walks extracted from the previous 2 articles on Collatz conjecture and Pseudorandom number generators have prominent word vertices "simulation", "graph", "mathematics" which convey the common thread connecting the two articles. Full text merge of the 2 articles might increase the accuracy but cause slowdown.

1150. (THEORY and FEATURE) NeuronRain CoronaVirus 2019 analyzer (R and Python - GEM,R Logit,Chaotic ERSIR Cellular Automaton Graph) - related
to all sections on Space Filling,Chaos,Cellular Automata,Social Network Analysis,Central Limit Theorem,Cybercrime analytics,Ramsey Theory - 5 July 2021, 6 July 2021, 8 July 2021
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1150.1 .NeuronRain implements CoronaVirus 2019 analyzer in R and Python for COVID19 Social Network BigData set which could be easily adapted to model quite a few chaotic processes - spread of memes,fads,cybercrimes,opinions and pandemics in a society. NeuronRain COVID19 analyzer models
COVID19 as a 2-dimensional space filling chaotic dataset by Verhulste-Pearl-Reed actuarial logistic, 2-D Cellular Automaton Graph, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression among other tools.
1150.2 .COVID19 ERSIR dataplot from December 2019 to June 2021 shows an intriguing order despite being chaotic - it is a symmetric bimodal (for 2 peaks) bell curve which tapers nicely around tails when it could have been of any other shape. Furthermore shape of the curve is independent of easing or tightening of curbs. This normal distribution could be explained by Central Limit Theorem(CLT). While some of the nations are already past the 3rd peak, dataplot for India is peaking and in 2-to-3 transition.
1150.3 2-D Cellular Automaton Graph for COVID19 SIR is 3-colored - edges between each of the vertices and its 8 neighbours in a social network or electronic network could be colored as Susceptible,Infected and Recovered. By Ramsey Theorem for Graphs and [Motzkin - Complete disorder is impossible] - 701.12 - "...Theorem 1 (Ramsey’s theorem). For any s, t ≥ 1, there is R(s, t) < ∞ such that any graph on R(s, t) vertices contains either an independent set of size s or a clique of size t. In particular, R(s, t) ≤ (s + t − 2,s − 1) ..." - order emerges (clique or independent set) inevitably in CAGraph for COVID19 SIR.
1150.4 CAGraph is a dynamic random graph in which values of point vertices are incremented-decremented (S-susceptible),incremented (I-infected) and decremented (R-recovered) and each point vertex of the CA Grid is a random variable.
1150.5 By Central Limit Theorem sum of values of point vertices on CAGraph tends to a normal distribution which fits the COVID19 dataplot. 
1150.6 An example space filling by 3-colored (SIR) Social network CAGraph vertices of 2-dimensional cellular automaton for COVID19 might look like (at some timepoint and labels of vertices might change dynamically):
			S I S R S I
			I R R S I R
			S S S R S S
			S R R I I R
			R I S S I S
			S R I R S I
and each of the vertices are labelled as S,I and R. Sum of the values of random variables for these vertices therefore tends to a bell curve by CLT (value(S) > values(I) > value(R)):
			S + I + S + R + S + I + I + R + R + S + I + R + ... = Normal Distribution
1150.7 8 neighbours per vertex in CAGraph is only a geometric heuristic implying actual degree could be multiple of 8 arborescent from a centroid vertex. Estimating the modals (peaks) of the normal distribution thus reduces to previous summation of random variables. Empirical data suggests R-number of COVID19 was 406 (a function of density of urban sprawls) for 30 days which is an approximate multiple of 8 and values of S,I and R were approximately in the range of 51 plus or minus. Being a high degree expander, mixing time of CA Random graph determines the time required to reach stationary distribution where transmission is modelled as a random walk in CAGraph. Thus estimating further peaks involves assigning heuristic values to S,I and R (51-100 based on vehemence). For example S,I,R = average_density_per_squarekm / area_of_2-yard_radius_circle which yields population within allowed social distance perimeter.
1150.8 Hypothetical estimate of COVID19 excess mortality in India based on 3-colored CAGraph model earlier where each social profile vertex is a random variable and colored by S(usceptible),I(nfected) or R(ecovered) - based on serosurvey 1150.12 which is a different kind of zero-knowledge projection of COVID19 outreach:
	1150.8.1 Percentage of population having antibodies (unvaccinated + vaccinated) in July 2021 serosurvey (possibly Infected) =  67.6% = 0.676 = Pr(Infected)
	1150.8.2 Percentage of unvaccinated population in July 2021 serosurvey = 62.2%
	1150.8.3 For 1.2% official mortality rate of COVID19 in India (1150.14), projected deathtoll for 1370 million population without serosurvey = 1370 million * 0.012 * 0.676 = 11.11344 million 
	1150.8.4 Assuming vaccines were 100% effective, percentage of Susceptible unvaccinated population (which had antibodies) from July 2021 serosurvey = 62.2% (unvaccinated) of 67.6% (population having antibodies) = 42.0472% = 0.420472 = Pr(Susceptible) 
	1150.8.5 For 1370 million population of India and 1.2% mortality rate of Susceptible, projected deathtoll from serosurvey = 1370 million * 0.420472 * 0.012 = 6.91255968 million atleast which coincides with Lancet,WHO,BMJ,Economist model trends of excess deaths.
	1150.8.6 From earlier CAGrid, Expected Sum of random variables of vertices valued 'S' (which tends to Gaussian by Central Limit Theorem) = Estimated COVID19 deathtoll

Cybercrimes where infected systems are mobile networks and not static could be modelled by SIR PDEs and mobility data for BF7 which has high Rt number of 3.42 - mobility data is a factor in determining infection of mobile networks as most technologies are proximity based and mobile devices depend on towers and Open WiFi access points. Address book attacks which spread en masse by recursively looking up contacts have high Rt number. CAGraph SIR model of pandemics-cybercrimes could be substituted for average number of neighbours from contacts model - CAGraph has constant degree of 8 contacts per node which could be a variable by contacts model (which is based on digital proxies-number of mobility card swipes in metro lines) and the graph ceases to be a cellular automaton any longer. Contacts model is also a good fit for mobile networks as cellular coverage depends on number of devices within the ambit of a tower (cell) or public wifi access point. Quarantine in mobile networks reduces to shutdown of suspicious towers even before infected signal reaches the devices. Mobile networks are another instances of clustering with a difference - points (devices) move dynamically between clusters (cell towers) and signal travels from centroid of one cluster (tower) to the other creating a graph of clusters. This kind of dynamic clustering wherein points are not static but move dynamically between clusters is less studied.

1154.1 Shor's BQP Integer factorization as VoterSAT in Majority-VoterSAT boolean composition or Oracle Turing Machine BQP^BQP derandomizes 100% to P (implying a sequential factorization) for infinite majority by CJT variants. But Parallel RAM factorization in NC which is finer than P implies more than one quantum state in BQP are chosen for certainty which is a contradiction unless NC=P (all PTIME problems are parallelizable) or BQP is derandomizable to NC by majority-VoterSAT boolean composition (plausible as majority is in non-uniform NC).
1154.2 If Shor factorization is in BQNC a subset of BQP, then there is no contradiction since CJT infinite majority-VoterSAT boolean composition amplifies success of BQNC to exact NC.
1154.3 NeuronRain theory drafts (Section 562) already contain a Quantum NC (QNC) computational geometric factorization in which pixelated or rasterized hyperbolic arc bow is treated as superposition of quantum states defined by amplitudes corresponding to classical probability of being a factor point.
1154.4 Derandomization of BQP factorization to P implies sequential exact factorization is possible in polynomial time.
1154.5 Gamma approximation of average case sequential polynomial time computational geometric factorization algorithm in NeuronRain perhaps is an evidence hinting at possibility of worst case sequential polynomial time factorization.

1155.4 Theoretical number of multicores required for NC-PRAM-BSP O((logN)^k) time planar point location factorization circuit is O(N/(logN)k). PRAM time O((logN)^k) for 2061 bits factorization circuit of depth 186 therefore is O(2061^186) and number of PRAMs required are O(2^2061/2061^186) = O(2^2061/2^2048) = O(2^13) = multiples of 8192 which is quite usual on clouds.

1156. (THEORY and FEATURE) Majority Voting by NC^BQP Oracle Turing Machine, Derandomization of BQP, Integer Factorization in BQP,QNC and PRAM-NC-BSP, Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm and secure voting - 4 August 2021,5 August 2021,6 August 2021,14 August 2021,15 August 2021 - related to 1152,1154 and all sections on Majority Voting, Communication complexity, KRW Conjecture, Boolean Function Composition and Integer Factorization
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1156.1 Majority Voting can be formulated by NC^BQP oracle Turing machine (which simulates composition of non-uniform Majority boolean function and BQPVoterSAT boolean function) as an alternative to broader BQP^BQP formalism of Majority Voting Oracle Turing Machine earlier - non-uniform majority NC circuit has infinite number of voter leaves which query BQP VoterSAT oracles.
1156.2 NC^BQP is a tighter version of BQP^BQP which if in BQNC (or BQNC=QNC because quantum circuit always has implicit bounded error by superposition and bounded prefix is redundant) derandomizes asymptotically to 100% NC by CJT-Margulis-Russo-Black-Ladha sharp thresholds for majority because p-bias < 1/3. 
1156.3 NC^BQP if in BQNC resolves the conflict between derandomization of Shor BQP factorization and PRAM-NC-BSP computational geometric factorization as BQP voter SATs are directly derandomized to NC instead of P. NC non-uniform majority function has oracle access to BQP Shor Factorization - all voters factorize same integer N and vote 1 if factors are right and 0 if wrong and 2/3 of the infinite population succeed by definition of BQP. It needs to be proved that NC^BQP is contained in BQNC (or QNC).
1156.4 NC^BQP is in QNC - Draft proof: NC^BQP oracle machine has infinite BQP Shor Factorization VoterSAT oracles who feed to the leaves of majority NC circuit - 67% of infinite BQP oracles factorize correctly and input 1 to majority NC circuit - This hypothetical NC^BQP voting machine for infinite population always returns 1 by majority. On the other hand, QNC or BQNC majority voting circuit (logdepth) has leaves as quantum voters by considering each vote as superposition of classical states a1<0| + a2<1| where <0| implies wrong factorization by Shor BQP algorithm and <1| implies correct factorization by BQP. Thus language L accepted by NC^BQP is also accepted by QNC or BQNC implying NC^BQP is in QNC=BQNC.
1156.5 Classical probabilites of amplitudes in each voter superposition are known - |a1|^2 = 1/3 and |a2|^2 = 2/3 by definition of BQP (Born Rule: classical probability = squares of modulus of complex amplitude). Infinite number voter superpositions whose classical probabilities are known apriori are input to QNC circuit. How the voter superposition a1<0| + a2<1| are handled internally within QNC majority circuit is matter of choice - for example QNC majority voting circuit might simulate (*) conventional NC nonuniform majority since NC is in QNC (*) QNC version of computational geometric factorization (*) Rabi oscillation and decohere to classical state <1| of high amplitude et al.
1156.6 In BQNC majority voting circuit earlier, each voter leaf exists in a state "0" (wrong factors) and "1" (right factors) specified by qubits a1<0| + a2<1| without actually simulating BQP factorization oracle within BQNC (which might not be BQNC any longer and "NC^BQP in BQNC" containment may not work) by apriori hardcoding of classical probabilties 1/3 and 2/3 to complex amplitudes a1 and a2 respectively. Embedding BQP oracle within BQNC is not necessary because by definition of BQP, factorization by each voter is both 67% right and 33% wrong and amplitudes for voter qubit superpositions can be predetermined without factorization. 
1156.7 Quantum Circuits ([Deustch] model) can be converted to Parallel RAMs in Nick's Class by Memory Peripheral model mentioned in https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/103.pdf - [Samuel Jaques and John M. Schanck - Waterloo] - Figure 1 - every quantum state evolves over time by Schrodinger equation Hamiltonian operator - d/dt|ψ(t)> = −iH|ψ(t)> and Voter qubits earlier have to abide by it. Quoted excerpt: "Time-evolution for a duration δ yields |ψ(t0 + δ)> = Uδ |ψ(t0)> where Uδ = exp (−iHδ)". This conversion from quantum gates to classical NC Parallel RAMs is another indicator of derandomization of BQP to NC.NC^BQP class could be alternatively construed as NC circuits having oracle access to PRAMs by converting Deustch model quantum circuits of BQP to Parallel RAMs in memory peripheral model which could be either NC^BPNC (if voter error is non-zero) and thus effectively in BPNC derandomizable to NC or NC^NC = NC (if voter error is zero) if number of PRAMs in oracle are O(N/(logN)^k) and depth added by PRAMs in oracle is O((logN)^k). Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm proposes a quantum solution to find the secret string s for a boolean function f(x) = x.s defined as dot product of bit positions in x and s, by Hadamard transform 1/2^n *Sigma((-1)^[f(x) + x.y] * |y>) for x,y in {0,1}^n which is non-zero only if y = s (others cancel out). VoterSAT of the form f(x) = x.s where every voter decides discreetly by dot product on a secret is susceptible to quantum reverse engineering.

1158.4 Every rectangular region could be thought of as histogram union of equal sized buckets which makes Factorization (or multiplicative partition) a special case of set partitions. 
1158.5 Example Schematic equivalence between a histogram H1 of unequal sized buckets and factorization histogram H2 of equal sized buckets - both of total size N:
		Histogram H1							Histogram H2
		------------							------------
		h1b1 ##################						h2b ###########
		h1b2 #######							h2b ###########
		h1b3 ##########							h2b ###########
		h1b4 #############						h2b ###########
		h1b5 ####							h2b ###########
=>  h1b1 + h1b2 + ... + h1b5 = N = h2b + h2b + ... + h2b
1158.6 Finding the exact Earth Mover Distance between H1 and H2 solves integer factorization indirectly. LC-ACT Earth Mover Distance between arbitrary unequal size bucket histogram H1 and equal size bucket histogram H2 could be written as optimization program:
=>  h1b1 + h1b2 + ... + h1b5 = N = h2b + h2b + ... + h2b = (h1b1 +/- a1c1) + (h1b2 +/- a2c2) + ... + (h1bn +/- ancn) for any integral value of ai and ci. a1c1 + a2c2 + ... + ancn = function_of(EMD) and solving for ai and ci finds factors of N. 
1158.6 Linguistically, every string made of one alphabet and arbitrary length is equivalent to factorization (ASCII or Unicode integer value replaces the alphabet) - Example: "aaaaa" is a string of length 5 which maps to a string histogram of 5 equal sized buckets (size of each bucket equals the ASCII or Unicode value v('a') of the alphabet 'a') => N = length_of_the_string * v(alphabet) 
1158.7 Recursion limit has been increased in DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized.py for stack overrun issues while recursing binary search point location for large integers.
1158.8 Disclaimer: All benchmarks for NeuronRain computational geometric factorization so far have been performed as Nick's Class proof-of-concept only on single node Python-Spark cluster quadcore for randomly chosen non-RSA moduli or semiprime integers (high omega, easy, smooth and hard). Factorizing RSA moduli and semiprimes could be significantly harder and expensive practically and requires enterprise cloud. An optimal PRAM implementation of Planar Point Location by Sorting/WaveletTrees/SegmentTrees/IntervalTrees might have to be plugged-in for accurate Parallel RAM results (e.g https://github.com/jlabeit/wavelet-suffix-fm-index). Previous Benchmark numbers might scale exponentially on a production-grade BSP cloud of huge multicores if communication complexity is negligible (e.g 1 second on single node quadcore might scale to nanosecond on BSP cloud of 10^9 multicores subject to Amdahl and Brent speedup theorems). 
1158.9 Integer Factorization benchmarks for RSA-250 semiprime moduli - 829 bits - was performed by CADO-NFS opensource software - https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=NMBRTHRY;dc42ccd1.2002 - Year 2020 - consumes runtime of ~2700 Core years (Intel Xeon 2.1 GHz - Sieving + Matrix - 1 year for 2700 CPU-multicores) for Number Field Sieve algorithm which is exponential in input size. Computational Geometric Factorization on the other hand which is polylogarithmic ((logN)^k) in input size would theoretically require:
	log 2700 ~= 11.3987 Core years for k=1 
or approximately 1 year on 12 CPU-multicore PRAM hardware to factorize RSA-250 829 bits semiprime moduli (stated as estimate without benchmarks).

1159.2 Equal bucket size histograms (or Factorization histograms mentioned in 1158) have been widely studied in BigData analytics by the name of V-Optimal histograms, Equidepth histograms and Equiheight histograms which strive to maintain depth and width of buckets to be equal.
1159.3 There are some recent results in computing Partition distance (which generalizes histogram and set partition distance measures such as Earth mover distance, Adjusted rand index etc.,) in linear time (linear in total size of histogram H1 which is moved to another histogram H2 which could be equidepth or equiheight) for closely resembling partitions - In following Example arbitrary histogram H1 of unequal bin size is moved to a equidepth or equiheight histogram H2 of equal bin size which factorizes 15 as 3 buckets of size 5 each:
	H1 (size 15 = 5 + 8 + 2)		H2 (size 15 = 5 + 5 + 5)

1159.4 Linear time partition distance of histograms if reducible to edit distance of string histograms implies SETH is false. Partition distance or histogram distance has been traditionally used to compare images for similarity by treating every image as histogram of pixels. Closely resembling partitions are crucial for image analytics, face recognition in specific because pixel histograms of visuals of humans might have only small variations as facial features differ slightly though facegraph segmentation of human faces abide by similar Topological Product Homotopy shape grammar (Section 715 - Contour deformations by Product Homotopy for facial feature grammar). Linear time partition distance for closely resembling histograms of human face visuals imply linear time face recognition. 
1159.5 Histogram Partition distance between two images could be a CoronaVirus 2019 analytics tool: 
	1159.5.1 Digital watermarking Overlay of COVID19 hotspot GIS geospatial imagery (JHU, ARCGIS, ESRI) on 6-colored SEDAC urban sprawl population estimator (GPW-4 - http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/mapping/popest/gpw-v4/) which color encodes urban sprawls by increasing population density estimated by convex hull polygons drawn around colored segments, and percentage of overlay is the similarity.
	1159.5.2 Instead of convex hull polygons, overlay the Voronoi facegraphs of the Urban sprawl SEDAC imagery and COVID19 hotspot GIS imagery and find similarity by graph edit distance (GED) between the facegraphs of two GIS images.
	1159.5.3 Compute Histogram Partition Distance between COVID19 hotspot GIS imagery and SEDAC urban sprawl density GIS imagery - low distance implies high overlay and high correlation between population density (average degree) and transmission of COVID19.  
1159.6 New file DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized.largestintegerfactorized has been created which contains the largest integer factorized by NeuronRain so far.

1165. (THEORY and FEATURE) Drone Online Shopping Delivery - NeuronRainApps - Refactoring for ConvexHull and GIS analytics variables read over
socket stream - related to all sections on Async IO, Drone Electronic Voting Machines, GIS and Urban Sprawl Analytics, Merit of Large Scale
Visuals, Drone Obstacle Avoidance, Computational Geometry - 12 October 2021, 21 October 2021, 23 October 2021
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1165.1 OnlineShoppingDelivery.py has been refactored for analytics variables read over socket stream (port 64001). Instead of inferring 
convex hull of the destination only from aerial GIS image by OpenCV2, optional clauses have been introduced to read longitude-latitude list 
of convex hull waypoints and mission way points over socket stream (nc -l 64001) port.
1165.2 GIS analytics variables have been enhanced by uncommenting earlier commented variables. Convex Hull from OpenCV is a list of integers
 and not in format of longitude-latitude of vertices of convex hull polygon which necessitates writing convex hull longlat(s) over socket stream or reading from file. OnlineShoppingDelivery.GISvars.txt has been updated for a reference list of variables.
1165.3 Convex Hull mission longitude-latitude list and GIS analytics key-value pair list written over socket stream have to be now demarcated by "end_longlat" and "end_gis" delimiter strings.
1165.4 start_mission() throws error "start_mission(): coro=run() done" errors if the waypoints are too faraway and PX4 console prints "waypoints are too far away" error messages. Because of this list of longitude-latitudes read over socket stream have been separated by decimals (reference: list of longitude-latitude(s) of mission.py example in MAVSDK Python source code)
1165.5 Earlier "start_mission(): coro=run() done" error has been documented also to be related to QGroundControl (QGC) in MAVSDK issues. But QGC installation is fraught with GLIBC and GLIBCXX version number errors which might require upgrade to gcc-9 and g++-9 and correct packages containing matching libstdc++.so.6 and libc.so have to be found by "strings". Some other MAVSDK documentation mention QGC is not necessary for mission.
1165.6 Earlier "coro=run() done" errors are resolved if start_mission() is populated with longlat(s) which are not faraway.
1165.7 OnlineShoppingDelivery.py is a versatile implementation which can be adapted to Drone Postal Delivery, Drone EVM, Drone Human Transport (if payload allowed is ~100kg and range of flight > 35 kms assuming solar panel powered drones,but mostly available drones have flight time of ~20 to 25 minutes requiring either a midair recharge or relayed drone delivery. Relayed drone delivery splits mission into equal distances for 20 minutes flight time and Drone(N) after its flight time lands and delivers payload to Drone(N+1) which continues mission to Drone(N+2). Without Relay same drone has to land at multiple intermediate points and has to be recharged every 20-25 minutes for continued mission. Relay drones are already recharged and ready for takeoff), Drone Autonomous Combat (Several military drones used for precision aerial bombings have high payload), GIS Mapping Drones among others. 
1165.8 Drone Human Transport (single seater) though a solution for surface traffic congestion, could cause air traffic congestion and special Drone Air Traffic Control (ATC) is necessary - ATC for drones is fully programmable (allocating non-colliding mission trajectories to drones) as drones are autopiloted and mission plans are controlled by ATC.
1165.9 Drone transport is 3-dimensional (longitude,latitude,altitude) as against 2-dimensional surface transport (longitude,latitude) and aerial transportation graph is non-planar, while surface transportation graph is planar - Open Source NASA Perseverance Mars Rover is both surface and aerial transportation (helicopter) drone - https://github.com/nasa-jpl/open-source-rover and https://opensourcerover.jpl.nasa.gov/ .
1165.10. Safe transport of items insulated from natural obstacles (e.g turbulent weather) is paramount for online shopping delivery - Drones being lightweight may not withstand ferocious onslaught of rain and winds. GIS analytics variables read over socket stream by OnlineShoppingDelivery.py Python implementation could be sourced from image and video analytics of GIS imagery by OpenCV2 - e.g list of mission longitude-latitude(s) dynamically changes based on weather vicissitudes learnt from remote sensing weather satellite photo of sky (clear,overcast,storms) which is an obstacle avoidance algorithm.
1165.11 Image analytics might require functionality to analyze any GIS imagery - SEDAC-GPW4-PopEst, Weather, Rural-Urban clusters,... - and segment those images to find facets of importance and least obstacles whose vertices have to be mapped to longitude-latitude and written over socket stream for live reading by drones (instead of nc -l). 
1165.12 MAVSDK does not seem to support dynamic mission plans to add/delete/update longitude-latitude(s) during flight after upload_mission()-start_mission() and all longlat(s) must be known apriori.
1165.13 Dynamic Mission Obstacle Avoidance Algorithm by GIS imagery analytics:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	1165.13.1 Drone executes TAKE_PHOTO command and transmits terrestrial image back to PX4-MAVSDK ground control and satellite weather GIS photo at that instant is used for obstacle overlay - the two images have to be overlaid to filter the obstacle vertices-edges.
	1165.13.2 MAVSDK Client invokes (*) transportation graph extraction algorithm on terrestrial image transmitted by drone and (*) image analytics segmentation on aerial GIS image to find segments containing obstacles - clouds, storms, dust, ... - obstacle segments are bounded by convex hulls 
	1165.13.3 MAVSDK client overlays the transportation graph imagery on segmented (convex hull) weather GIS imagery and masks the vertices and edges (roads and junctions) from transportation graph which coincide with obstacle segment convex hulls (e.g road-junctions vertices-edges on earth directly below and with in cloud convex hull segments in sky are masked and removed from transportation graph - in other words, holes are punctured in transportation graph fabric by convex hull obstacles) 
	1165.13.4 Shortest distance (Geodesic) is computed between source and destination on the obstacle masked punctured transportation graph and Geodesic longlat(s) (from Geocoding Geodesic functionality - https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html?highlight=geodesic#module-geopy.distance) are populated dynamically before upload_mission() and start_mission() which bypasses obstacles.
1165.14 Graph masking earlier to remove terrestrial transportation subgraphs coinciding with aerial GIS imagery obstacle segments could be non-trivial computational geometric problem.
1165.15 Obstacle segments in GIS imagery are usually convex hulls (e.g polygon ensconcing clouds) and planar intersection algorithms are required to find transportation graph edges-vertices which intersect and are with in obstacle convex hull edges-vertices of aerial GIS imagery.
1165.16 Previous algorithm could be an implementation separate from MAVSDK client which computes Graph Obstacle Masking earlier and writes thegeodesic longlat(s) over socket stream as GIS analytics variables to MAVSDK client.

1165.19 Another important manmade obstacle for civilian drones are sabotage (mistakenly shotdown, antidrone systems) causing payload destruction. Most countries mandate licensing for drones which to some extent can minimize human errors - Drones are discoverable by UUID which can be verified for security checks. Modern drones are fitted with onchip radar SAA - Sense and Avoid - https://www.droneassemble.com/obstacle-avoidance-radar-in-drones/
1165.20 Artificial obstacle by sabotage for Drones is as risky as any surface verhicle - Both are equally prone to attacks. There are some recent efforts (Project Interceptor - https://www.codemotion.com/magazine/dev-hub/security-manager/project-interceptor-avoiding-counter-drone-systems-with-nanodrones/) which evade antidrone systems by nanodrones.

1167.1 Because of importance of GIS geospatial imagery for Urban Sprawl Analytics, new source file GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.py has been added
to NeuronRain repositories which defines function urban_sprawl_from_segments() for reading an urban sprawl GIS image and segment it by
contours and compute convex hulls around contour polynomial points. 
1167.2 NASA VIIRS 2016 imagery for India NightLights python-src/image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/testlogs/NightLights_13nasa-india-2016.jpg is contour segmented by ImageGraph_Keras_Theano.py image_segmentation() and contours of 1825 urban areas in the subcontinent are read by previous function.
1167.3 Convex Hulls of 1825 urban areas are found by OpenCV2 convexHull(). Circumference of 1825 urban sprawls is computed from cv.arcLength() of the urban area segment contour polynomials and approximate urban sprawl area is derived from circumference as a circular region:
	Area = 3.1428 * (Circumference/2*3.1428)^2
1167.4 Segmented Contours of 1825 urban sprawls are written as JPEG image file python-src/image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/testlogs/RemoteSensingGIS/NightLights_13nasa-india-2016_segmented.jpg which are fairly accurate in demarcating urban areas and new insights of urban areas emerge - formation of megalopolises in TN,MH,Gangetic Plain and lopsided growth in certain pockets.

1168.1 GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.py has been updated to compute area of every Urban Area in contour segmented NASA VIIRS NightLights 2016 imagery by cv2.contourArea() in addition to circular area approximation, draw bounding box rectangle around each of 1825 Urban area sprawls by cv2.boundingRect(), write an id string for every urban area bounding box by cv2.putText() and sort the list of tuples of contour areas of cities which is printed as rankings of Urban areas.

1169.6 Urbanization percentage which is the ratio of sum of contour areas of urban sprawls in VIIRS imagery to total area of nation might have a heuristic limit of 67% going by Greenery standards of 33%. Sparse Polynomial packing of urban sprawl contour closed polynomials could hence be written as a linear program:
	a(c1) + a(c2) + a(c3) + ... + a(cn) <= 0.67*A
for areas of urban sprawl contours a(c1),a(c2),a(c3),...,a(cn) and total area of nation A. Sum of urban sprawl contour areas combines 3 of the 4 colors of urban sprawl facegraph (Residential,Commercial,Manufacturing-IT-ITES) excluding Greenery.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1170.1 In continuation of Urban sprawl contour analytics of NASA VIIRS NightLights 2012 and 2016 imagery earlier, latest NASA VIIRS imagery
of India dated 6 November 2021 from https://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/cli061nrt-Daily-Nighttime-lights has been analyzed by GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.py for EMD similarity and Growth of Urbanization in India between 2016 and 2021.
1170.2 Previous image of India NightLights has been manually captured in file NightLights_13nasa-india-2021.jpg from resourcewatch.org and is not a NASA released composited and filtered image. It contains some cloud formations and lighting could be slightly exaggerated because of Deepavali fireworks on 04 November 2021 and later. Mismatch in image sizes, additional graphics could have contributed to exaggeration. 
1170.3 Following are some excerpts of logs on Indian Urban area statistics in 2021 in comparison to 2016:
	2021:	('Number of segments - Number of Urban areas:', 7335)
	2016 to 2021:	('EMD Histogram distance similarity between images - testlogs/NightLights_13nasa-india-2016.jpg and testlogs/NightLights_13nasa-india-2021.jpg :', (0.031924109905958176, None, array([[36.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.],
1170.4 Number of Urban area circles have roughly quadrupled from 2016 to 2021 and multiplied 8 times from 2012 - 835 to 1914 (2012-2016),1914 to 7335 (2016-2021) - Exaggeration by Deepavali lights could be minimal because only luminosity might have been boosted per urban area and festival may not have created so many new contours. 
1170.5 EMD similarity between 2012 and 2016 is 5% while EMD similarity between 2016 and 2021 is 3% perhaps pointing at 95% and 97% dissimilarity respectively (approximate doubling(s) in urbanization between 2012-2016 and 2016-2021).
1170.6 Previous analytics measures prima facie might hint at spectacular annual urban growth and increase in electricity consumption of 20-25% out of sync with GDP growth (which was negative in some quarters and grew on the average by 5-8% during 2012-2021 - agriculture contributes 70% to GDP of India and glaring Urban-Rural divide could be pulling down the numbers)

1171. (THEORY and FEATURE) GDP estimation from GIS Urban Sprawl Analytics - related to 694,1170 and all sections on GIS and Urban Sprawl Analytics, Merit of Large Scale Visuals, EventNet and Graphical Event Models-Causal Event Models, Computational Economics, Economic Merit, Four Color Theorem, Multiple Agent Resource Allocation, Linear and Logistic Regression, Intrinsic Merit Rankings, R Ricker and SEDAC GPW4 Population Estimations, Social Network Analytics, Space filling by Curves, Unequal Circle and Polynomial packing, Chaos and Mandelbrot sets, Computational Geometry, Linear Programming - 9 November 2021,12 November 2021,13 November 2021,14 November 2021
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1171.1 From 694.1: India’s GDP is estimated by a logistic regression based on parameters including electricity growth - [Arvind Subramanian] - https://growthlab.cid.harvard.edu/files/growthlab/files/2019-06-cid-wp-354.pdf - "...We divide the sample into two periods, pre-and post-2011. For each period we estimate the following cross-country regression: 𝐺𝐷𝑃 𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑤𝑡ℎ𝑖 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1𝐶𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑡 𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑤𝑡ℎ𝑖 + 𝛽2𝐸𝑙𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑤𝑡ℎ𝑖 + 𝛽3𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡 𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑤𝑡ℎ𝑖 +𝛽4𝐼𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡 𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑤𝑡ℎ𝑖 + 𝛽5𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑎 + 𝜀� ..."
1171.2 Similarly, Rural-Urban GDP of India could be estimated by Logistic Regressions from Urban Sprawl Analytics of NASA VIIRS NightLights imagery which quantifies urban growth in terms of electricity consumption growth.
1171.3 Logit1: Total GDP growth of nation could be written as linear or logistic regression on Rural GDP growth and Urban GDP growth:
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Total GDP Growth = a1*UrbanGDPGrowth + a2*RuralGDPGrowth + constant, a1 and a2 are weightages for Rural and Urban GDP
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1171.4 As farm output contributes 70% to India's GDP, a2=0.7 and a1=0.3. For an example total GDP growth of 5% per annum and constant=0, substituting in Logit1:
	5% = 0.3*UrbanGDPGrowth + 0.7*RuralGDPGrowth
1171.5 From VIIRS Urban Sprawl Analytics earlier, India's Urban growth could be 25% annually in the past decade. Substituting in Logit1:
	5% = 0.3*25% + 0.7*RuralGDPGrowth
	=> 5% - 7.5% = 0.7*RuralGDPGrowth
	=> -2.5%/0.7 = RuralGDPGrowth = -3.5%
	=> Or Indian Agricultural sector shrunk (grew negatively) by 3.5% in past decade
1171.6 Logit2 - Alternatively, another logistic regression could be derived from Four coloring of Urban sprawl facegraphs which segment region to Residential (R),Commercial (C),Manufacturing-IT-ITES (M),Greenery-Agriculture-Waterbodies (A) which can be written as linear or logistic regression on growth of each sector:
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Total GDP Growth = a1*M + a2*R + a3*C + a4*A + constant and weightages a1,a2,a3,a4 are defined as:
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	a1 = weightage for M - Growth in manufacturing-IT-ITES industries
	a2 = weightage for R - Growth in residential areas
	a3 = weightage for C - Growth in commercial areas
	a4 = weightage for A - Growth in farming
1171.7 Weightage for Greenery(A) a4 = 0.7 which is same as Logit1. Weightages a1,a2,a3 for remaining 3 colors could be 0.1 each because growth in residential,commercial and industry are highly interconnected while growth in farming affects residential and commercial activities mostly and manufacturing industry is less connected to Greenery-farming
1171.8 Intersegment Growth Event Dependencies in Four colored urban sprawl growth in 1171.7 could be picturised by a Graphical Event Model (GEM)-Causal Event Model (CEM) below (by double-sided arrows and one-sided arrows):

	Manufacturing-IT-ITES<----------- 		
		/\			|
		|			|--------------------
	        |					    | 
	        \/					    V
	Residential <--------------------------------> Commercial
		/\				            /\	
		|					     |
		|--------------- Farm ------------------------
				
1171.9 On substitution for a1-a2-a3=0.1, a4=0.7 and constant=0, Logit2: Total GDP Growth = 0.1*M + 0.1*R + 0.1*C + 0.7*A. For Total annual GDP growth of 5% and Urban growth of 25% per annum (constituted by 3 colors - Manufacturing-IT-ITES,Residential,Commercial):
	Logit2: 5% = 0.1*25 + 0.1*25 + 0.1*25 + 0.7*A
		=> 5% - 7.5% = 0.7*A
		=> -2.5%/0.7 = A = -3.5%
		=> Or Indian Agricultural sector shrunk (grew negatively) by 3.5% in past decade
1171.10 Previous numbers are demonstrative only and could depend on accuracy of images, but hint at an unequivocal trend reasonably of farm sector contraction dragging GDP down.
1171.11 GDP Regression in 694.1 which is mostly manufacturing specific, could be substituted for Manufacturing-IT-ITES sector growth (M) in Logit2: Total GDP Growth = a1*M + a2*R + a3*C + a4*A + constant 
1171.12 Manufacturing-IT-ITES growth (M) = 𝛽1*CreditGrowth + 𝛽2*ElectricityGrowth + 𝛽3*ExportGrowth +𝛽4*ImportGrowth
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Logit3: Total GDP Growth = a1*𝛽1*CreditGrowth + a1*𝛽2*ElectricityGrowth +  a1*𝛽3*ExportGrowth + a1*𝛽4*ImportGrowth + a2*ResidentialGrowth + a3*CommercialGrowth + a4*AgricultureGrowth + constant 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Of these, ElectricityGrowth could be estimated by NASA VIIRS Urban Areas NightLights imagery. ResidentialGrowth and CommercialGrowth are proportional to ElectricityGrowth.
1171.13 Infrastructure Growth (Air-Road-Rail-Sea Transport Infrastructure Growth, Cement and Steel Consumption Growth, Water supply Growth) is another crucial variable which could be incorporated in Logit3 as additional Manufacturing-IT-ITES and Agriculture sector parameter to make a comprehensive Logit4:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Logit4: Total GDP Growth = a1*𝛽1*CreditGrowth + a1*𝛽2*ElectricityGrowth +  a1*𝛽3*ExportGrowth + a1*𝛽4*ImportGrowth + a2*ResidentialGrowth + a3*CommercialGrowth + a4*AgricultureGrowth + a5*CementGrowth + a6*SteelGrowth + a7*TransportInfrastructureGrowth + a8*WaterSupplyGrowth + constant 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1171.14 Based on Logit4, Graphical Event Model-Causal Event Model earlier for 4-colored (M,R,C,A) GDP intersegment growth event causal dependencies could be expanded to following well-connected GEM-CEM (Vertices are labelled by 4 colors. Credit vertex is 2-colored for both Manufacturing and Agriculture sectors. Cement&Steel vertex is 3-colored by M,C,R because of its fundamental importance to Manufacturing-IT-ITES,Residential and Commercial segments. Transport and Electricity are 4-colored because power and logistics are central to all 4 sectors). Finer subdivision can be obtained by adding more vertices in supply chain:

	   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	   |				       	    |			                  |
	   -----------	Cement&Steel (M,C,R) --- Exports (M) ----- Credit (M,A) ---- Imports (M)

1172. (THEORY and FEATURE) GIS Weather Analytics and Image grayscale inversion - implementation - related to 445,446,463,1165,1171 and all sections on GIS and Urban Sprawl Analytics, Mining patterns from Astronomical Datasets for correlating celestial-terrestrial events, Machine Learning solutions to N-Body problem, Merit of Large Scale Visuals, Space filling by Curves, Unequal Circle and Polynomial packing, Chaos and Mandelbrot sets, Computational Geometry, Drone Obstacle Avoidance, Autonomous Online Shopping Delivery - 11 November 2021
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1172.1 Weather Forecast is an indispensable element of Urban planning, Disaster Response, Agriculture Warning Systems among others. Finding weather obstacle segments - clouds and winds - from Weather GIS imagery is essential for safe navigation of autonomous aerial vehicles. Study of Orderly Disorder in Long term weather forecast gave birth to Deterministic Chaos theory (Lorenz attractors - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton_Lorenz) 
1172.2 Because of separate modelling involved in predicting weather vagaries, new source file GISWeatherAnalytics.py has been created and two functions weather_GIS_analytics() and invert_image() have been defined.
1172.3 Function weather_GIS_analytics() reads a Weather GIS image and computes contour and convex hull segments from it quite similar to Urban sprawl contours but computed contour polynomials are for aerial weather phenomena instead of terrains viz., cloud, wind - which is passed as parameter to weather_GIS_analytics().
1172.4 An example Low pressure trough satellite image testlogs/Windy_WeatherGIS_2021-11-11-13-07-51.jpg over Bay of Bengal from https://www.windy.com/-Satellite-satellite?satellite,20.448,79.387,5 (unedited,unfiltered and uncomposited) has been segmented and cloud contours from it are ranked by their convex hull area and circumference. Cloud contours are labelled by integers.
1172.5 Function invert_image() inverts a thresholded image to its grayscale complement. Image inversion is particularly necessary in four color segmentation of an urban sprawl facegraph e.g. NASA VIIRS NightLights urban areas. Inverted VIIRS NightLights image indicates non-urban areas - Unlit, Rural, Underdeveloped areas and Greenery. 
1172.6 Previous windy.com image has been inverted in grayscale and printed to testlogs/Windy_WeatherGIS_2021-11-11-13-07-51-inverted.jpg 
1172.7 NOAA HURDAT2 Hurricane and USGS Earthquake datasets have been Sequence Mined earlier to correlate gravitational effects of celestial n-body choreographies from astronomical ephemeris datasets (NASA JPL Ephemeris) and terrestial extreme weather events. GISWeatherAnalytics supplements this Celestial-Terrestrial weather event pattern analytics.
1172.8 GIS Weather imagery could as well be a timeseries stream of images read from Streaming_AbstractGenerator Facade and yielded to GISWeatherAnalytics.py for live weather analytics - movement and velocity of cloud and wind contours, number and area of cloud-wind contours, altitude of clouds, gradual strengthening of low pressure troughs to Cyclones-Hurricanes among others.

1173. (THEORY and FEATURE) Large Scale Visuals Streaming NoSQL Datastore (MongoDB-GridFS) support in Streaming_AbstractGenerator Facade - related to 1 and all sections on BigData NoSQL backend, Streaming analytics, Merit of Large Scale Visuals, Compressed Sensing, GIS Urban Planning Analytics, GIS Weather Analytics, Drone Imagery Analytics, Online shopping delivery, Obstacle avoidance - 15 November 2021
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1173.1 Streaming_AbstractGenerator.py facade design pattern has been updated with a clause for GIS and Visuals streaming on MongoDB-GridFS backend which facilitates storage of large visuals (> 16 MB) 
1173.2 Within Streaming_AbstractGenerator.py, MongoDB GIS and Large Scale Visuals database "neuronraingis" has been created with a bucket id "bucket1" which stores various weather GIS visuals uploaded manually by Robomongo3T-Studio3T GUIs (could be automated through a standalone python client code). StreamingAbsGen() object is instantiated within GISWeatherAnalytics.py by passing the datasource (GISAndVisualStreaming), datastorage (MongoDB) and MongoDB GridFS Bucket (bucket1) as arguments. The __init__() and __iter__() methods of StreamingAbsGen class have been changed for member variables and iterator yield by enumerating items in GridFS bucket.  
1173.3 Choice of an optimal datastore for streaming image files has been contentious and use of databases for storing large images has been discouraged. For example, Netflix OTT platform implements a proprietary datastore NMDB which ingests huge movie files and keeps track of customer billing optimized for realtime response. NoSQL choices are of widerange from ElasticSearch to MongoDB-Kafka-Kinesis-Cassandra to Hadoop-Sparrk Parquets. Many video streaming platforms are hosted on proprietary AWS Kinesis and S3.
1173.4 NeuronRain analytics which transcends the whole gamut of software stack from application layer machine learning---middleware---OS kernel cloud RPC system calls-drivers-scheduler requires a robust performant opensource backend which serves large files especially images and videos in realtime with low latency. MongoDB's GridFS which supports huge files is an opensource alternative. By this commit, NeuronRain-MongoDB-GridFS could be termed an enterprise-grade streaming and OTT platform for deploying and streaming large visuals including movies.
1173.5 Downloaded image files from MongoDB are read from GridOut object and cast to bytes by io.BytesIO(). PILlow Image.open() is invoked to read the image bytestream which is then written to a temporary file name testlogs/GISAndVisualStreamNoSQLStore.jpg for use by weather analytics. Previous pattern of upload and iterator download of large scale visuals through Streaming_AbstractGenerator might have to be replicated throughout NeuronRain image analytics - topological face recognition and handwriting recognition, GIS satellite imagery for remote sensing, urban sprawls and weather. 
1173.6 Compressed Sensing sketch for compressing-decompressing large image files has been minimally implemented in NeuronRain. For minimizing storage, GIS and large visuals might have to be compressed and stored.
1173.7 Drone imagery analytics for Online Shopping Delivery and Obstacle avoidance is another arena which requires realtime analytics of streaming images transmitted by drone. Images from on-flight drone have to be segmented live to find natural,weather and man-made obstacles and accordingly alter drone trajectory.
1173.8 MongoDB-GridFS BigData backend earlier could well be suitable for any other bigdata not just limited to visuals - Sifting large volumes of emails and documentation requires storage which is non-proprietary. There are opensource web email and repository linked web hosting providers like www.protonmail.com and readthedocs.org which could be feeds to MongoDB-GridFS backend.

1174. (THEORY and FEATURE) GIS Urban Sprawl Analytics - Moments,Centroid,Minimum Enclosing Circle of an urban sprawl - 17,18 November 2021 -
related to all sections on GIS Urban Sprawl Analytics, Merit of Large Scale Visuals, Computational Geometry, Intrinsic Merit Rankings, R Ricker and SEDAC GPW4 Convex Hull Population Estimations, Social Network Analytics, Space filling by Curves, Unequal Circle and Polynomial packing, Computational Geometry, Four color theorem, Economic Merit, Computational Economics 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1174.1 GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.py has been updated to compute OpenCV2 moments of each urban sprawl contour and centroids from those moments.Each urban sprawl contour is bounded by a minimum enclosing circle (cv2.minEnclosingCircle() and cv2.circle()) drawn around it which is a better measure of extent of an urban area because an urban sprawl might consist of multiple smaller contours within a bigger contour interspersed by semi-lit areas.
1174.2 Two urban sprawls of Chennai and Bengaluru from NASA VIIRS India NightLights (https://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/cli061nrt-Daily-Nighttime-lights) imagery on 17 November 2021 - NASAVIIRSNightLightsChennaiMetropolitanArea_17November2021.jpg - are compared.
1174.3 Ranking of Urban Sprawls has been changed to sorting based on circular area of urban sprawl radius computed from cv2.minEnclosingCircle() instead of contour area since multiple suburban contours are packed within a larger outermost urban sprawl contour as drawn in NASAVIIRSNightLightsChennaiMetropolitanArea_17November2021-contourlabelled.jpg. In this example,Bengaluru as a landlocked sprawl has single contour and a minimum enclosing circle while Chennai has single largest contour and multiple suburban contours within perimeter of an outermost minimum enclosing circle which offers a glimpse of growth patterns in two metro areas. NightLights being only a lowerbound estimate of an urban sprawl, has to be superseded by minimum enclosing circle upperbound estimate. Based on area of minimum enclosing circle Chennai's urban sprawl exceeds Bengaluru significantly. Following are excerpts of the logs for areas of the 2 minimum enclosing circles of Chennai and Bengaluru:
	Chennai - 50645.060000000005 (excluding area of sea in the circle would reduce it to ~35000 by visual estimate)  
	Bengaluru - 27157.860000000004
1174.4 Each urban sprawl contour is now identified by an id concatenated by its area rather than mere id earlier and fonts have been shortened.
1174.5 Bengaluru is roughly circular and heavily lit while Chennai's semi-circular urban sprawl elongates heavily to west,north,south and comprises two large segments - first extending upto Kanchipuram in west,Tada in north and Tiruvanmiyur in south which is heavily lit and the second less lit segment of ECR till Kalpakkam - which comprises host of backwaters,beaches,marshes and waterbodies - as could be gleaned from NASAVIIRSNightLightsChennaiMetropolitanArea_17November2021_segmented.jpg. Minimum Enclosing Circle for Urban sprawl area of Chennai earlier does not include aforementioned elongated western segment addition of which would further extend metropolitan agglomeration area to ~40000. 
1174.6 Centroid of an urban sprawl is a crucial metric for assessing gradual movement of core of a city (over a period of time) around which economic activity takes place.

(THEORY and FEATURE) GIS Urban Sprawl Analytics - Population Estimator from Urban Sprawl Contours - usecase study of few urban sprawls - related to 1174 and all sections on GIS Urban Sprawl Analytics, Merit of Large Scale Visuals, Computational Geometry, Intrinsic Merit Rankings, R Ricker and SEDAC GPW4 Convex Hull Population Estimations, Social Network Analytics, Space filling by Curves, Unequal Circle and Polynomial packing, Computational Geometry, Four color theorem, Economic Merit, Computational Economics, Approximation of functions by polynomials, Weirstrass Theorem, Jordan Curve Theorem, Cellular Automaton Graph model of diffusion of opinions/memes/cybercrimes/pandemics, Multiple Agent Resource Allocation - 21,22,23,24,25,26 November 2021
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
1175.1 GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.py has been updated to analyze NASA SEDAC GPW 4.11 Population Estimation 2020 imagery (revised from 2015 SEDAC GPW 4 estimates) for Southern India which has brought to light emergence of some new countermagnet urban sprawls between 2015 and 2020 (e.g Hosur UA as competitor to Bengaluru UA of almost equal area and density, Tirupur UA as countermagnet to Coimbatore UA, Amalgamation of Puducherry-Cuddalore as one huge urban sprawl of few million population).
1175.2 SEDAC GPW 4.11 Population Count 2020 image testlogs/SEDAC_GPW4-11_PopulationEstimate2020.jpeg has been downloaded and photoshopped by GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) selection editor to remove non-urban low density area pixels by selecting only high population density urban areas. Few noise pixels along periphery of Urban Areas have been erased. Edited image has been written to testlogs/SEDAC_GPW4-11_PopulationEstimate2020_edited.jpeg
1175.3 Urban sprawl contour polynomials are closed curves sparsely packed on a 2D surface and by Jordan Curve Theorem any closed curve divides a planar region into interior and exterior half-plane regions. Simply connected regions do not have holes while multiply connected regions do. Thus unequal sparse packing of urban sprawl contours (as holes) on a 2D surface of a nation is multiply-connected. 
1175.4 As there is no algorithm for packing arbitrary closed curves on a 2D surface, Voronoi tessellation diagram is the closest approximation of each urban sprawl closed curve contour by a polygon. By Weirstrass theorem, every function can be approximated by a series summation of polynomials within a bounded error and thus every Voronoi diagram polygon approximates an urban sprawl contour polynomial:
		|f(x) - l(x)| < epsilon
		f(x) = Urban sprawl contour polynomial
		l(x) = series summation of line equations for sides of Voronoi diagram polygon 
1175.5 Earlier edited image testlogs/SEDAC_GPW4-11_PopulationEstimate2020_edited.jpeg has been contour and convex-hull segmented by GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.py and minimum enclosing circles have been drawn around them.
1175.6 Estimating populations of Urban Areas requires conversion of Contour area to square kilometer area. Rough legend could be circumference_of_earth / length_of_GIS_imagery.
1175.7 Function urban_sprawl_from_segments() from GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.py has been updated to pass on average population density as argument so as to compute population by formula contour_area_in_squarekilometers * population_density. 
1175.8 Contour area to Square kilometer area conversion has been made configurable by passing ratio of contour area to square kilometer area as argument to urban_sprawl_from_segments(), because ratio depends on image size and requires prior knowledge from a training data of contour area and its corresponding square kilometer area E.g. Ratio of contour area 854.0 and corresponding square kilometer area of 266.0 for cityid 1356 (Kumbakonam UA) in SEDAC_GPW4-11_PopulationEstimate2020_edited-contourlabelled.jpg has been used as reference heuristic multiplicand for population density of 5000 per square kilometer area. 
1175.9 Ratio of contour area of urban sprawl to total area of GIS image (height * width) has been computed which is an alternative ranking measure for urban areas.
1175.10 putText() has been changed for font color, size and area append has been removed for better clarity of cityid displayed. City id(s) are displayed only for urban sprawls of non-zero contour area.
1175.11 Urban Sprawl network of southern India has undergone a metamorphosis from 2015 to 2020 based on SEDAC GPW 4.11 mapping and thus exemplifies preferential attachment in this real social network vis-a-vis virtual social networks such as Facebook and Twitter.

1175.13 It can be observed that cities of huge urban sprawls have proportionately high population density (which is the real equivalent of average degree in virtual social networks) and Urban GDP is proportional to population density:
	estimated population = population_density * urbanarea
	=> population_density = constant * urbanarea
	=> estimated population = constant * (urbanarea)^2
which can be used as an alternative heuristic estimate in the absence of population density data. This heuristic has been implemented in GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.py for constant value 6.22 (from training data of cityid 1356 for population of 440000 and 266 square kilometer area: 6.22 = 440000 / (266)^2)

1175.16 Urban Sprawl Social Network could be formalized as a 2D tensor (each vertex of a graph is a graph) where each of the urban sprawl contour of various areas are vertices and every urban sprawl vertex is a social network graph in itself with role of average degree being played by population density. Urban sprawl vertices are interconnected by transportation graph having rural areas of lesser density as intermediary vertices. Urban sprawl network 2D tensor thus has two dimensional nesting of edges and vertices:
	1175.16.1 Intra urban sprawl social network - every urban sprawl vertex is in itself a social network having people as its vertices and population density as its average degree (average number of people who might be in contact per person per unit area e.g in a suburban public transportation network). In Cellular Automaton Graph model for spread of memes/pandemics/cybercrimes/opinions average degree per person is a multiple of 8.
	1175.16.2 Inter urban sprawl social network - Urban sprawl vertices are connected by transportation graph among cities,towns and metropolitan agglomerations. Transportation network between urban sprawls is the lifeline of intermediary rural regions as they depend on and gravitate towards nearest urban sprawls to make a living eventually devoured by nearest urban sprawl.
	1175.16.3 NASA VIIRS NightLights and NASA SEDAC GPW segmentation and minimum enclosing circles are real equivalent of community detection or graph partitioning in virtual social networks which concerns grouping close-knit social network vertices of similar nature by modularity defined by - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity_(networks) - and Strength of Weak Ties - http://snap.stanford.edu/class/cs224w-2017/slides/15-weakties.pdf.
1175.17 Urban Sprawl Analytics thus automates urban planning, land usage statistics, multiple agent resource allocation(MARA) and has zero-error because of its completely algorithmic approach (bounding urban sprawls by watershed segmentation, convex hull, minimum enclosing circle, Voronoi diagram tessellation algorithms on VIIRS NightLights and other gridded population GIS imagery) with nil human intervention assuming algorithmic fairness.

1176. (THEORY and FEATURE) GIS Weather Analytics and Climate Analytics from OpenWeatherMap PyOWM and ECMWF CliMetLab - implementation - 
30 November 2021 - related to 148,445,446,463,1165,1171 and all sections on Correlation between gravitational effects of Mined Celestial N-Body Patterns and terrestrial extreme weather events (or Gravitational effects on climate change), Drone natural obstacle avoidance, Drone autonomous online shopping delivery, Drone Electronic Voting Machine, Large Scale Visuals Recognition, Artificial Intelligence models for Climate Change
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1176.1 GISWeatherAnalytics.py has been updated to define a new function weather_forecast() which imports Python client for OpenWeatherMap (https://openweathermap.org) - PyOWM - https://github.com/csparpa/pyowm - and makes REST API calls to OpenWeatherMap weather data and OneCall forecast for a location by city name or latitude-longitude. 
1176.2 PyOWM Weather details and forecast include humidity,temperature,rain,precipitation probability,wind,heat,clouds for a location. Forecast is made through one-call API for 1-week window per longitude-latitude. OpenWeatherMap sources weather forecasts from multitude of providers including ECMWF,NOAA. Function weather_forecast() might be invoked by a Drone autonomous delivery client or Drone Electronic Voting Machine and accordingly its mission plan could be charted avoiding longitude-latitude waypoints of extreme weather. An example invocation of current weather and 7-day forecast for location "Chennai" and its longitude-latitude has been shown in logs testlogs/GISWeatherAnalytics.log.30November2021. 
1176.3 An alternative to PyOWM is ECMWF MetView Python Client - https://github.com/ecmwf/metview-python - but requires MetView 5.0 and above, significant preprocessing and shell script modifications (/usr/bin/metview) for environment variables to make it work. API access credentials are a prerequisite for access to ECMWF meteorological data by MARS client - https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/WEBAPI/Access+MARS . MetView GUI can create python scripts for loading and analyzing datasets.
1176.4 Another function climate_analytics() has been defined which loads various climate datasources from ECMWF by CliMetLab python library and tries to model them using machine learning. CliMetLab obfuscates various dataset formats including GRIB. Presently few CliMetLab climate datasets - ECMWF-Copernicus-ERA5, NOAA Hurricane Dataset - HURDAT2, ECMWF-MARS, High-Low - have been sourced (optionally cast to Pandas Dataframes) and High-Low atmospheric pressure dataset is trained by a TensorFlow-Keras Sequential Linear Regression which could be used as forecast model - based on Jupyter notebook at https://climetlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/05-high-lows.html#Build-the-model. Logs testlogs/GISWeatherAnalytics.log.30November2021 print the trained model and its prediction on test high-low data. Such models add to the kitty of SequenceMining (by Class Association Rule-APrioriGSP,BioPython-ClustalOmega Multiple Sequence Alignment algorithms) models for correlating celestial n-body choreographies and terrestrial extreme weather events (Sections 17,148 and 445 detail some correlations already mined from USGS Earthquake and NOAA Hurricane datasets) 
1176.5 ECMWF datasets ERA5, MARS and High-Low require ECMWF (https://apps.ecmwf.int/registration/) and Copernicus API Keys (https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to#install-the-cds-api-key) information in files ~/.cdsapirc and  ~/.ecmwfapirc and there could be error messages of the form - " <user> has no access to service/mars " despite API key perhaps due to ECMWF MARS datacentre migration and dataset shutdown. Because of this limitation, ERA5 and MARS dataset invocations have been commented.
1176.6 Logs for this update are at testlogs/GISWeatherAnalytics.log.30November2021. Two functions for weather and climate segregate medium range weather forecast based on GIS and machine learnt analytics on historic climate data, the latter being an artificial intelligence challenge - Improve subseasonal-to-seasonal precipitation and temperature forecasts with Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence - https://s2s-ai-challenge.github.io/.

1177.1 Computational geometric Voronoi tessellation growth algorithm is exactly what is necessary to simulate urban sprawl expansion - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram#/media/File:Voronoi_growth_euclidean.gif. Growing adjoining urban sprawl circles collide (intersection points of the circles are connected to form sides of each polygon) to create closely packed Voronoi tessellation polygons which approximate urban sprawl contour polynomials by Weirstrass theorem.
1177.2 One of the motivations for urban sprawl analytics is to allocate resources (urban land and waterbody use) equitably among 4 prominent sectors by an envy-free mechanism - segments of Industry, residential, commercial and greenery must be optimally distanced from one another. 
1177.3 29-color coded land use segments in GIS of Chennai metro area mentioned in 1174.8.5 could be a good reference which might be relevant to any urban sprawl for optimal multiple agent resource allocation through complexity theoretic tools. 
1177.4 An example multiple agent resource allocation algorithm for 29-colored Chennai metropolitan area GIS Urban Sprawl facegraph:
	1177.4.1 Find the facegraph of 29-colored GIS (or number of colors from map legend) imagery
	1177.4.2 For all shortest paths or random walks between every pair of vertices (s-t), allocate 29-colors equally amongst the vertices of the shortest path or random walk
	1177.4.3 Example: If there are 290 vertices (faces) in a path or walk between s and t, every path or walk connecting s and t must have 10 vertices each of same color (for 29 colors, 290/29 = 10) and colors are arranged in arithmetic progressions. For 4 colors - if 29 colors are reducible to 4 colors by four color theorem - and a path or walk traversing 12 vertices, coloring scheme by arithmetic progression is: 1-2-3-4-1-2-3-4-1-2-3-4 which periodically repeats 4 colors for 12 vertices in the path or walk. This coloring scheme by arithmetic progression should be satisfied by every path or walk in the facegraph.
	1177.4.4 Previous allocation by assigning colors to vertices (variables) of every path or walk is a constraint satisfaction problem, constraint being the condition of arithmetic progression of colored vertices for each path or walk. Feasibility and complexity of satisfying arithmetic progression coloring constraint for every path or walk for arbitrary number of colors which is stringent criterion, could be an open problem as it is harder than mere satisfiability and enforces arithmetic progression structure in assignments.
	1177.4.5 For 2-colors, every alternate vertex in a path or walk could be colored 0 or 1 which makes it a subset promise of boolean DNFSAT problem by defining one conjunctive clause per path or walk constituted by boolean variables of the vertices thereof.
	1177.4.6 Example 2-colored walk of 10 vertices alternately marked 0 and 1: 1-0-1-0-1-0-1-0-1-0 and corresponding disjunctive clause is (v1 /\ !v2 /\ v3 /\ !v4 /\ v5 /\ !v6 /\ v7 /\ !v8 /\ v9 /\ !v10) and there are as many clauses as there are paths or walks in urban sprawl facegraph. Computing all walks or paths and formulating DNF clauses from them adds to the complexity of DNFSAT MARA.
1177.5 Rationale for previous allocation is it optimally locates each segment and no segment of one color (face) is neither too far away nor too close from another segment of same color decongesting land use and thus equitable.
1177.6 Urban sprawl expansion based on suburban transport coverage is quite scientific in the sense the travel patterns of floating population using suburban transport has already been studied. Urban sprawl expands by a real equivalent of Preferential attachment (Rich-get-richer or big cities get bigger). Expansion of urban extent occurs along the circumference of an urban sprawl contour and an optimal,sustainable urban expansion gives equal weightage to all 4 colors (Manufacturing-IT-ITES-M,Residential-R,Commercial-C,Vegetation-V) of the segmented urban extent facegraph. For a 29-colored urban land use facegraph,expansion attaches additional faces along the periphery of the graph or composes ears to existing face graph (converse of ear decomposition of a graph). Faces or ears thus attached to facegraph might have to be colored equitably by 4 colors of M,R,C,V thus adding one more constraint dimension to DNFSAT MARA earlier.

1178. (THEORY and FEATURE) GIS Analytics - MongoDB GridFS backend standalone client implementation - related to 1173,1174 and all sections on GIS Urban sprawl analytics and weather analytics,Streaming analytics, Merit of Large Scale Visuals - 6 December 2021
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1178.1 New standalone MongoDB GridFS client python-src/backend/GISMongoDBGridFSStreamingClient.py has been implemented which can independently upload and download large scale visuals to and from MongoDB GridFS backend.
1178.2 Two functions streaming_upload() and streaming_download() have been defined in GISMongoDBGridFSStreamingClient.py which respectively wrap GridFS put() and get(). Visuals are lookedup and retrieved by fileid(s) created by put() and get().
1178.3 Need for such a client separated from Streaming_AbstractGenerator facade arises because of necessity for an alternative command line interface upload and download facility for bulk visuals to and from GridFS without installing Robomongo3T and Studio3T. 
1178.4 Storing large scale visuals in MongoDB GridFS is not straightforward and requires additional shape metadata. Function streaming_upload() also inserts the shape information per image and returns a tuple of image fileid, shape fileid and image name which are inturn used in streaming_download() to get the image and shape as strings. Image string is a flattened ndarray which is reshape()-d by shape information eval()-ed from shape fileid string.
1178.5 This client for large scale visuals can be plugged into NeuronRain backend/MongoDB_DBClient.py for text data which uses find()-insert_one() pair and Streaming_AbstractGenerator.py facade optionally.
1178.6 An example invocation of GISMongoDBGridFSStreamingClient.py uploads a contour labelled NASA SEDAC GPW 4.11 Urban Sprawl GIS image ../image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/testlogs/SEDAC_GPW4-11_PopulationEstimate2020_edited-contourlabelled.jpg to GridFS and downloads it to testlogs/GISMongoDBGridFSStreamingClient_ExampleImage.jpeg and the logs are at testlogs/GISMongoDBGridFSStreamingClient.log.6December2021

1179.1 Estimation on Urban Sprawls of Southern India (which has since been chosen because of heavy urbanisation) from NASA SEDAC GPW 4.11 Population count 2020 imagery https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/gpw-v4-population-count-rev11/data-download in 1175 was based on population count which has been revised in Population density 2020 imagery https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/gpw-v4-population-density-rev11 to include latest urban area boundaries and new urban sprawls.
1179.2 SEDAC GPW 4.11 Population Density 2020 image SEDAC_GPW4-11_PopulationDensity2020.jpeg has been GIMP photoshopped to remove non-urban area pixels and edited image is stored in SEDAC_GPW4-11_PopulationDensity2020_edited.jpeg
1179.3 SEDAC_GPW4-11_PopulationDensity2020_edited.jpeg has been contour and convex hull segmented and minimum enclosing circles are drawn around urban sprawls.

(THEORY and FEATURE) GIS Urban Sprawl Analytics - Voronoi Tessellation Diagram implementation engulfing urban sprawl contours - related to 1174,1175,1179 and all sections on GIS Urban Sprawl Analytics, Merit of Large Scale Visuals, Computational Geometry, Intrinsic Merit Rankings, R Ricker and SEDAC GPW4 Convex Hull Population Estimations, Social Network Analytics, Space filling by Curves, Unequal Circle and Polynomial packing, Computational Geometry, Four color theorem, Economic Merit, Computational Economics, Neural Network Model of Urban Extent, Approximation of functions by polynomials, Weirstrass Theorem, Jordan Curve Theorem, Cellular Automaton Graph model of diffusion of opinions/memes/cybercrimes/pandemics, Multiple Agent Resource Allocation - 9 December 2021
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1180.1 GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.py has been updated to implement function draw_voronoi_tessellation() to draw Voronoi polygons surrounding contour polynomials of urban sprawl extents thus approximating them by a polygonal packing of 2D surface.
1180.2 Facets from Voronoi 2D planar subdivision are enumerated and polygons are drawn by OpenCV2 polylines().
1180.3 Centroid of each polygon in tessellation is the centre of minimum enclosing circle around the urban sprawl contour polynomials. 
1180.4 Voronoi diagram has been written as a layer on SEDAC_GPW4-11_PopulationDensity2020_edited-contourlabelled.jpg.
1180.5 Big urban areas are covered by multiple Voronoi polygons. Asymmetry in areas of the polygons is a measure of skewed development and every polygon is a mix of urban area and rural hinterland depending on it as nearest economic fulcrum for livelihood.
1180.6 Sustainable urban development therefore is to strive for almost equally sized Voronoi polygons. Area of Voronoi polygon around an urban contour is thus susceptible to expansion and future urbanization.
1180.7 python-src/image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/ImageGraph_Keras_Theano.py has been changed to revamp the for loops adding edges to facegraph of Voronoi tessellation 2D subdivision.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1181.1 ImageGraph_Keras_Theano.py has been updated to change the way facegraph is plotted - instead of centroids from cv2.connectedComponentsWithStatsWithAlgorithm(), centroids of the contours are now being used for plotting the facegraph ensconcing the contour polynomials. Contour centroids are comprehensive and numerous compared to cv2.connectedComponentsWithStatsWithAlgorithm() and must be more suitable for urban sprawl analytics. 
1181.2 GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.py has been executed for this enhancement to compute a detailed facegraph of urban area contours and its Degree,Betweenness,Closeness and PageRank centrality measures for urban vertices which are essential ranking metrics.
1181.3 Following are the affected logs, Facegraph DOT and JPEG image files for this change:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
1182.1 python-src/image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.py has been changed to define Function draw_delaunay_triangulation() to add Delaunay triangulation plot in testlogs/SEDAC_GPW4-11_PopulationDensity2020_edited-contourlabelled.jpg
1182.2 Delaunay triangulation is the dual of Voronoi diagram and quite crucial urban sprawl analytics tool as it approximates transportation graph (aerial and surface) between prominent urban contour centroids and thus could be a Hamiltonian (traverse each vertex once) or Eulerian circuit (traverse each edge once - https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.euler.eulerian_circuit.html#networkx.algorithms.euler.eulerian_circuit) estimator tool for autonomous drone delivery of services (Drone EVM, Drone online shopping delivery) so as to visit each edge connecting cities or each city vertex once.
1182.3 Delaunay triangulation plot has been added as layer to testlogs/SEDAC_GPW4-11_PopulationDensity2020_edited-contourlabelled.jpg by 8-connected lines of cv2.line() while Voronoi diagram has been plotted by antialiased cv2.line().

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1183.1 Average Degree of Transportation graph vertices or its approximation by Delaunay triangulation increases with the economic importance and urban expanse of a city sprawl contour - Centroids of Large urban area contours have high transport connectivity and high degree.
1183.2 Urban sprawl expansion is quantifiable by distance between two Voronoi tessellations of geospatial imagery at two time points separated by some duration.
1183.3 Voronoi tessellations at two time points differ when new urban area contours (and Voronoi polygons containing them) emerge and existing urban area contours (and Voronoi polygons containing them) expand.
1183.4 Voronoi tessellation is a visual clustering algorithm (each polygon is a cluster) and Earth mover distance (EMD) can measure distance between Voronoi tessellation clusters of two GIS images separated by time interval which is directly proportional to expansion of urban sprawls.
1183.5 While EMD between two Voronoi tessellation clustering would consider the area of each Voronoi polygon, Graph edit distance between two Voronoi facegraphs would estimate newly added edges and vertices and cannot account for change in area of each face.
1183.6 As against Square and Hexagonal tessellated cellular automata grids which respectively are of 8 and 6 neighbours, Voronoi facegraph allows faces of arbitrary number of neighbours.
1183.7 Spread of memes/fads/opinions/pandemic in a social network of urban sprawls could be better simulated on their Voronoi facegraphs than Cellular automaton graph which is of average degree 8 or multiples of it.
1183.8 GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.py has been updated to compute Approximate Graph Edit Distance (NetworkX implementation) between Voronoi facegraphs of two NASA VIIRS Nighttime Lights images of India (2012 and 2016) separated by 4 years but commented because of slow approximation of GED. Exact Graph Edit Distance wrapper in NeuronRain (GraphEditDistance() - GraphMining_GSpan.py) is NP-Hard and slower for huge graphs which is as well commented. Both Voronoi Facegraph and its dual Delaunay triangulation graph have been overlaid and plotted to NightLights_13nasa-india-2012-contourlabelled.jpg and NightLights_13nasa-india-2016-contourlabelled.jpg
1183.9 As a stopgap and timesaving alternative to costly Graph Edit Distance similarity of facegraphs, community structure of 2 facegraphs (how clustered urban sprawls are) is detected by modularity matrix of all vertices and Wasserstein Earth mover distance of modularity between two urban sprawl facegraphs is computed as distance similarity or growth of urban sprawl communities over a period of time. Infact, Modularity captures the notion of communities better than Graph Edit Distance.
1183.10 Community structure distance - increase in modularity between 2012 and 2016 NASA VIIRS imagery is printed to logs testlogs/GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.log.15December2021 - excerpts:
	Increase in Community structure - Wasserstein EMD of modularity: 0.0006727360452344568

1184.1 Ratio of Voronoi Tessellation Polygon area to the Urban sprawl contour polynomial area contained in polygon is an estimate of Rural-Urban Land use and disparity.
1184.2 Area of Voronoi Facet Polygon combines Rural and Urban sprawls (Close polygonal packing - as Voronoi Tessellation is a partition of total surface area) while Area of Contour is specific to more populous urban sprawl subset (Sparse polynomial packing) of the outer Voronoi polygon.
1184.3 GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.py has been updated to compute area of each of the Voronoi Tessellation Facet polygon by Shapely Polygon() and Correlation-PValue of the sorted arrays of Voronoi polygon areas and Contour polynomial areas of urban sprawls is found by Kendall-Tau Correlation Coefficient and there are some striking facts emerging from it.
1184.4 Following are excepts of logs from testlogs/GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.log.17December2021 Correlation-PValues of sorted arrays of Areas for VoronoiFacets-Contours of NASA VIIRS India Urban Sprawls from NightLights 2012 and 2016:
	1184.4.1 VIIRS NightLights 2012 - (Correlation,PValue) between Contour areas and Voronoi polygon areas of Urban sprawls: (0.9089575693287888, 4.4992471056554334e-294) implying 90% correlation between areas of Voronoi polygons (Rural+Urban) and Contours (Urban)
	1184.4.2 VIIRS NightLights 2016 - (Correlation,PValue) between Contour areas and Voronoi polygon areas of Urban sprawls: (0.8049119202576946, 0.0) implying 80% correlation between areas of Voronoi polygons (Rural+Urban) and Contours (Urban)
1184.5 Downward trend of correlation from 90% to 80% (2012 to 2016) perhaps is an indicator of rising disparity between areas of Voronoi polygons (Rural + Urban) and Contours (Urban) contained in them or there is a growing mismatch between Urban sprawls and Rural areas. Previous deduction is just one angle of interpreting the anamoly while there could be many. Number of India urban sprawl contours have doubled from 834 in 2012 to 1912 in 2016 creating new Voronoi Facets which could have caused the decline in correlation. Some urban sprawls could have expanded faster than others occupying more space within outer Voronoi polygons making inroads into rural suburbs skewing the correlation.

1184.7 Urban sprawl contours and Voronoi polygon facets containing them could be a variant of Hub-Spokes model - Every urban sprawl contour is a Hub and its peripheral rural regions within Voronoi polygon are spokes depending on and connected to urban hub contour centroid. Hub-spokes together constitute a community.

1185.1 Recognition of Shapes (Shape Grammar for Faces,Handwriting,...) by Topological Product Homotopy and Homeomorphic Deformations (their limitations) mentioned earlier has been implemented geometrically by Segmenting an image and plotting Voronoi tessellation and Delaunay triangulation spiderweb on it as overlay. Their morphology is analyzed.
1185.2 python-src/DeepLearning_ConvolutionNetwork_BackPropagation.py has been updated to define two functions face_recognition_image_segmentation() and face_recognition_image_segmentation_contours() which segment an imagefile of human face and draw Voronoi tessellations and Delaunay triangulations as overlay
1185.3 Two visuals of the author python-src/testlogs/IMG_20160610_071455.jpg and python-src/testlogs/IMG_20160610_071603.jpg having small differences have been Voronoi tessellated and Delaunay triangulated and mesh(s) have been written to python-src/testlogs/IMG_20160610_071455-tessellated.jpg and python-src/testlogs/IMG_20160610_071603-tessellated.jpg.
1185.4 Voronoi Facegraphs of the images have been written as DOT files to python-src/testlogs/IMG_20160610_071455_FaceRecognition_Segmentation_FaceGraph.dot and python-src/testlogs/IMG_20160610_071603_FaceRecognition_Segmentation_FaceGraph.dot
1185.5 Watershed segmentation for the images are written to python-src/testlogs/IMG_20160610_071455_segmented.jpg and python-src/testlogs/IMG_20160610_071603_segmented.jpg
1185.6 python-src/DeepLearning_BackPropagation.py , python-src/DeepLearning_ConvolutionNetwork_BackPropagation.py and python-src/image_pattern_mining/ImageToBitMatrix.py have been upgraded to Python 3.7.5 by autopep8 and 2to3 utilities. Python 2.7 versions of the files have been renamed to python-src/DeepLearning_BackPropagation.py.2.7, python-src/DeepLearning_ConvolutionNetwork_BackPropagation.py.2.7 and python-src/image_pattern_mining/ImageToBitMatrix.py.2.7
1185.7 Shape Grammar for Human face mentioned in 715 in terms of union of product homotopies as follows:
	   					<Hair>
                                          <Ear><Eye><Eye><Ear>
                                                <Nose>
                                                <Mouth>
is easier to define in tessellated images as homeomorphic deformations (Typical example: Coffee mug is homeomorphic to Donut Torus, 'D' is product of 'I' and ')' by pasting lemma) of Voronoi facets (Graph edit distance as face similarity between 2 facegraphs could be costlier even for closely resembling images being NP-Hard and has been ignored. GED does not measure change in areas of facets between two graphs which is a drawback). Voronoi facets could be partitioned into components of the Shape grammar earlier - facets for <Hair>,<Ear>,<Eye>,<Nose>,<Mouth>.
1185.8 Facet areas of Voronoi and Delaunay spiderweb (and angles of facet edges) have changed notably between two images earlier in spite of minute variations in features while number of facets (vertices and edges) is almost the same. This requires a Facet Area Augmented Graph Edit Distance measure which counts in changed angles between the morphed facet edges.

1186.1 DeepLearning_ConvolutionNetwork_BackPropagation.py has been changed to compute centroids of the contours from cv2.moments() and if there is an exception from minEnclosingCircle().
1186.2 Areas of Voronoi polygons are computed from Shapely Polygon() and Wasserstein EMD similarity of Voronoi facet areas between 2 images is computed which measures the deformation of the facial features in 2 images. 
1186.3 Performing Voronoi tessellation around centroids computed from facial landmarks detection algorithm instead of cv2.moments() centroids might increase the alignment of the Voronoi facets along facial feature landmarks (<Eye>,<Nose>,<Mouth>,...) of the Shape Grammar.
1186.4 Hausdorff distance between Douglas-Peucker contour polynomials of the two images are computed which is another similarity metric.
1186.5 Histogram Partition Distance (EMD) similarity (cv2.EMD()) of the two images in toto is computed (histogram_partition_distance_similarity()). These three distance similarities help identify people more often if faces in two images are heavily similar (and not arbitrary images of same person) and could assist in landmark based facial recognition. OpenCV Voronoi Tessellation is done in 2D and 3D Voronoi Tessellation could be a better choice for modelling arbitrarily oriented images of same person - changes in facial features and emotional face orientations happen in 3D and not in 2D.
1186.6 Finally Approximate and Exact Graph Edit Distance similarity computation between Voronoi Facegraphs of the two images has been introduced but left commented because of NP-Hardness.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1187.1 DeepLearning_ConvolutionNetwork_BackPropagation.py has been updated to import dlib face landmarks detection and draw Voronoi and Delaunay triangulation facegraphs from face landmark centroids instead of contour centroids which aligns the Voronoi faces symmetrically centered around face landmarks. Dlib face landmarks detection finds standard of 68 points of five features of Human face Shape Grammar - Ear, Nose, 2 Eyes, Mouth.
1187.2 DeepLearning_ConvolutionNetwork_BackPropagation.py has been updated to import netrd Graph Distance and NetworkX Graph Isomorphism implementations. Netrd implements extensive distance similarity measures for comparing two Graphs. Image FaceGraph Voronoi Planar Subdivision is populated either from contour centroids or face landmark centroids depending on boolean flag fromlandmarks which defaults to True.
1187.3 Image Voronoi FaceGraph similarity computations between 2 images have been segregated to a new function facegraph_similarity_metrics() which computes Voronoi FaceGraph Facet areas EMD, Hausdorff distance between facial image contour polynomials, Whether 2 facegraphs are isomorphic or not, Whether 2 facegraphs are subgraph isomorphic or not, Netrd Jaccard distance between 2 facegraphs, Netrd Jensen-Shannon Degree Divergence between 2 facegraphs and Graph Edit Distance between 2 facegraphs (commented).
1187.4 Three facial images testlogs/IMG_20160610_071455.jpg,testlogs/IMG_20160610_071603.jpg and testlogs/KSrinivasan_2003.jpg of author are compared pairwise for similarity. While first two images dated 2016 are heavily similar, last image dated 2003 has noticeable differences separated by 13 years. 
1187.5 Histogram partition distance and Voronoi FaceGraph similarities are computed pairwise for 3 images earlier. While two heavily resembling images testlogs/IMG_20160610_071455.jpg and testlogs/IMG_20160610_071603.jpg are Voronoi FaceGraph Isomorphic and Subgraph Isomorphic, image pairs (testlogs/IMG_20160610_071603.jpg and testlogs/KSrinivasan_2003.jpg) and (testlogs/IMG_20160610_071455.jpg and testlogs/KSrinivasan_2003.jpg) are less similar and are not Voronoi FaceGraph isomorphic but Subgraph isomorphic. Thus Graph Isomorphism and Subgraph Isomorphism of Voronoi FaceGraphs act as distinguishers of facial features - Percentage of Voronoi FaceGraph Isomorphism-Subgraph Isomorphism wanes as images become increasingly dissimilar (Voronoi facegraphs of images are more likely to be subgraph-isomorphic than isomorphic for same person). Graph Isomorphism similarity earlier is an unusual application in Topological Face Recognition for measuring homeomorphic facial deformations (or conjecturally, Voronoi Graph-Subgraph Isomorphism implies Topological Homeomorphism). 
1187.6 Dlib uses iBUG 300W training dataset /tmp/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat for learning face landmarks which can be downloaded from https://github.com/italojs/facial-landmarks-recognition/blob/master/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat. Earlier implementation of Face recognition is Graph theoretic differing from usual computer vision algorithms focussing on machine learning models for face recognition. Graph similarity, Graph matching and Exact-Subgraph-Approximate Graph Isomorphism are related concepts for mining patterns in graphs. Percentage of isomorphism between image Voronoi facegraphs could be an intrinsic merit ranking metric for an image search engine.
1187.7 Following are the log excerpts:

1188.1 DeepLearning_ConvolutionNetwork_BackPropagation.py has been updated (facegraph_similarity_metrics()) to compute isomorphic subgraphs of Voronoi Diagram Facegraphs obtained from 2 facial images by two algorithms - VF2 and ISMAGS
1188.2 Number of iterations of isomorphic subgraphs has been set to 15 as default which is configurable function parameter. ISMAGS algorithm prints different subgraphs for symmetry=False and symmetry=True. 
1188.3 ISMAGS symmetry=True clause has been commented due to slowdown. Percentage similarity between two images could be derived from the number and size of isomorphic subgraphs. Example function for image similarity between two images = number of isomorphic Voronoi subgraphs of size > constant
1188.4 Contour segmented and Facegraph images of the 3 JPG files have been added to repository:

1188.5 It is obvious to note that contours of facial images themselves are landmark detectors to some extent as contours mostly straddle facial features. Accuracy of contour based face landmark detection could be increased by changing pixel color contrast of the binary inverted images.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1189.1 DeepLearning_ConvolutionNetwork_BackPropagation.py has been updated to analyze more visuals for unique person identification across arbitrary images. 
1189.2 facegraph_similarity_metrics() has been changed to increase number of default isomorphism iterations to 25. ISMAGS symmetry and Graph Edit Distance have been made function parameters set to default False and their respective clauses have been uncommented.
1189.3 Subgraph Isomorphism Percentage similarity between two facial visuals are computed for VF2 and ISMAGS clauses by ratio of number of vertices in the isomorphic Voronoi subgraphs and total nuumber of vertices in Voronoi Facegraphs. If two visuals are Fully Isomorphic percentage similarity is set to 100. Both directions of the percentage ratio (denominator changes for size of image Facegraphs of image1 and image2 while numerator - size of isomorphic subgraph - stays same) are printed and the minimum of the two is considered as subgraph similarity.
1189.4 Two more visuals have been compared - testlogs/IMG_20171112_180837.jpg and testlogs/ExamplePortrait1.jpg - former a visual of author (2017) and the latter being a portrait drawn by author (1990). Following are pairwise similarity computations by facegraph_similarity_metrics():

1189.5 Excerpts of the logs at testlogs/DeepLearning_ConvolutionNetwork_BackPropagation.log.29December2021 reveal an important finding - Visuals of a person separated by small time durations are Fully Isomorphic. Three facial images testlogs/IMG_20160610_071455.jpg, testlogs/IMG_20160610_071603.jpg and testlogs/IMG_20171112_180837.jpg of the author separated by 1.5 years are fully isomorphic while all these three images are only subgraph isomorphic to 13 years older image testlogs/KSrinivasan_2003.jpg. This points to change in facial features over a period of 14+ years affecting Voronoi facegraph and isomorphism:

1189.6 Following could be a thumbrule decision tree for face recognition by isomorphism (Earth mover distance between Voronoi Facegraphs of the images is attached high priority in the tree) where leaves are graded by probabilities - extremely likely,highly likely and likely:
		If Voronoi facegraphs of two images are Fully isomorphic:
		{	
			   /* There are less chances of False positives and False negatives - Face recognition is almost certain.*/
			   Images are "extremely likely to be similar" and might belong to same person. 
		}
		else if Voronoi facegraphs of two images are not Fully isomorphic but less stringent subgraph isomorphic:
		{
			   /* high chances of false positives and false negatives depending on decision tree branch */ 
			   /* and percentage probability for "likely" and "highly likely" */
			   if Wasserstein EMD between Voronoi facet areas of the images are high:
			   {
				if subgraph isomorphism percentage similarity is low:
					Images are "highly likely to be dissimilar" and might belong to different persons
				if subgraph isomorphism percentage similarity is high:
					Images are "likely to be similar" and might belong to same person
			   }
			   else if Wasserstein EMD between Voronoi facet areas of the images are low:
			   {
				if subgraph isomorphism percentage similarity is low:
					Images are "likely to be similar" and might belong to same person
				if subgraph isomorphism percentage similarity is high:
					Images are "highly likely to be similar" and might belong to same person
			   }	
		 }
		 else if Voronoi facegraphs of two images are neither fully isomorphic nor subgraph isomorphic:
		 {
			Images are "extremely likely to be dissimilar" and might belong to different persons
		 }
1189.7 In the examples earlier testlogs/ExamplePortrait1.jpg and testlogs/IMG_20171112_180837.jpg are subgraph isomorphic (and percentage similarity is high and EMD of Voronoi Facet areas is also high which are mutually in conflict) though former is a faminine watercolor art and thus a False positive. 
1189.8 Previous Graph theoretic and topological face recognition is an unsupervised classifier while conventional face recognizers are mostly supervised depending on training data. Rather, Machine learning training models could be formulated from Voronoi facet areas of face images as training priors.

1192. (THEORY and FEATURE) Software Analytics - Graph Isomorphism Similarity of Code Callgraphs and Control Flow Graphs - Spark 3.0.1 + Python 3.7.5 - related to 1191,619,770,906,911,771 and all sections on Program Analysis, AsFer-USBmd-VIRGO-KingCobra FTrace kernel callgraph analysis - Valgrind-Callgrind-KCacheGrind-Flamegraph userspace callgraph analysis, SATURN control flow analysis of VIRGO linux kernel, Software Analytics, Pandemic model of Botnet-Defense adversarial Game theoretic security, Cybercrime analytics, Anti-Malware,Anti-Ransomware,Anti-Theft and Anti-Plagiarism tools - 2 January 2022
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1192.1 Updated CyclomaticComplexitySparkMapReducer.py software analytics python implementation to define new function graph_matching() which finds Graph Isomorphisms between 2 control flow graphs or callgraphs of executables by VF2 and ISMAGS isomorphism implementations of NetworkX.
1192.2 Few pairs of SATURN VIRGO linux kernel DOT files, FTrace kernelspace callgraph DOT files, KCacheGrind userspace callgraph DOT files are compared by graph_matching() which internally instantiates NetworkX Graphs from DOT files.
1192.3 Isomorphisms (Full and Subgraph) are printed to logs testlogs/CyclomaticComplexitySparkMapReducer.log.Python3.7.5.Isomorphism.2January2022 and provide hints to kernelspace and userspace code most invoked by different program executables. Percentage similarities are printed in both directions of Graph matching (G1 -> G2 and G2 -> G1). Callgraphs are matched pairwise and only similar executables are fully isomorphic and subgraph isomorphic while dissimilar executables are not. Matching has been restricted to few pairs only as Graph isomorphism is computationally intensive and its lowerbound complexity is not yet proved.
1192.4 Graph Isomorphisms are tools to find similarity of codebases belonging to different repositories which is a pointer to frequently common algorithms and design patterns across implementations. Graph Isomorphism Detectors are used in anti-plagiarism tools and analyzing malicious code invocations (if Callgraphs-ControlFlowGraphs in two computers running similar executable are not isomorphic something could be brewing - one of them could be infected). Two executable copies of same code running in 2 computers must be callgraph isomorphic or atleast subgraph isomorphic. Control flow graph depends on parameters to the program which changes callgraphs for same executable between machines in which case  atleast few subgraphs of the callgraph must be similar (subgraph isomorphic) or two callgraphs must be approximate isomorphic (number of isomorphic vertices-edges are maximized). If callgraphs are not full-subgraph-approximate isomorphic between two machines executing similar executable of identical parameters, then some kind of corruption must have happened somewhere - quite useful forensic in modelling script injection cybercrime attacks which usurps and alters control flow by injecting malware in userspace that percolates down to kernelspace derailing usual sequence of kernel function callgraph in FTrace (e.g Cross Site Scripting - XSS, SQL injection attacks, Buffer overrun exploits). Degree sequence of the two callgraphs which is a monotone non-increasing series of vertex degrees is a non-isomorphism graph similarity measure.
1192.5 Previous code change implements an item specified in https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/Krishna_iResearch_DoxygenDocs/blob/master/kuja27_website_mirrored/site/kuja27/PhDThesisProposal.pdf on isomorphism of Program Control Flow Graphs (SATURN-FTrace-Valgrind-Callgrind-KCacheGrind) and Slice Dependency Graphs.
1192.6 FTrace logs and DOT files of kernelspace callgraphs for "find" and "pwd" executables created by asfer_ftrace.sh and parsed to DOT by:
	ftrace_callgraph_dot("ftrace.pwd.log")
	ftrace_callgraph_dot("ftrace.find.log")
have been added to repositories:
	find.ftrace_callgraph.dot
	ftrace.find.log
	ftrace.pwd.log
	pwd.ftrace_callgraph.dot
1192.7 Isomorphism iterations and ISMGAS symmetry have been made configurable arguments and set to default 25 and False respectively. CyclomaticComplexitySparkMapReducer.py has been upgraded to Python 3.7.5 + Spark 3.0.1 by autopep8 and 2to3 utilities. Python 2.7 version of CyclomaticComplexitySparkMapReducer.py has been renamed to CyclomaticComplexitySparkMapReducer.py.2.7.

(THEORY and FEATURE) GIS Analytics - DBSCAN Density Clustering implementation - related to 1182 and all sections on Merit of Large Scale Visuals, Text analytics, Unsupervised clustering, GIS and Urban Sprawl Analytics - Urban Extent Learners, Computational Geometry, Intrinsic Merit Rankings, R Ricker and SEDAC GPW4 Convex Hull Population Estimations, Community detection, Social Network Analytics, Space filling by Curves, Unequal Circle and Polynomial packing, Computational Geometry and Polygonal packing by Voronoi Tessellation, Four color theorem, Economic Merit, Computational Economics - 5 January 2022
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1194.1 New source file DBSCANClustering.py has been added to repository which implements award winning DBSCAN clustering algorithm especially useful for visual clustering of images, GIS Mapping and Urban Sprawl Extent Learners (NASA SEDAC,VIIRS and recent state-of-the-art Landsat9 TIRS2 and OLI2 - https://www.nasa.gov/content/landsat-9-image-gallery).
1194.2 DBSCAN is intuitive and finds clusters by density concentration of points around a core point which is the cluster centroid.
1194.3 Following is a gist of DBSCAN algorithm pseudocode implemented in DBSCANClustering.py:
	1194.3.1 For each core point find the neighbours of it bounded by minPoints by some distance function
	1194.3.2 If number of neighbours is < minPoints mark the point as noise else create a new cluster label for the core point
	1194.3.3 Initialize a seed set to neighbours of the core point and for all neighbour points of a core point find the neighbours (neighbours of neighbours - expands the cluster recursively till seedset is exhausted) and add them to the cluster by labelling - Graph theoretically, community of neighbours or a strongly connected component of neighbourhood is detected.
1194.4 DBSCANClustering.py finds neighbours (greater than minpoints) within a 4*(epsilon)^2 pixel area square bounding box (of side 2*epsilon) around a point after filtering below a threshold pixel value. Clusters are stored in a dictionary map of pixel-to-label. Present implementation of DBSCAN is visual clustering specific but could be used for any multidimensional text dataset after minor datatype changes to find_neighbours() and clustering() functions. DBSCAN clusters could be optionally invoked in place of OpenCV2 Contouring, Watershed Segmentation and Minimum enclosing circle boundaries of urban sprawl extents in image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.py.
1194.5 An example scatterplot visual image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/testlogs/GHSL_GIS_ChennaiMetropolitanArea.jpg of Chennai Metropolitan Sprawl Population Density from Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL - Urban Centre Database 2018 - https://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ucdb2018visual.php# ) has been DBSCAN clustered and written to image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/testlogs/GHSL_GIS_ChennaiMetropolitanArea_dbscanclustered.jpg by write_clustered_image() - clusters are color coded by DBSCAN cluster label. Only the less dense areas of the map are clustered perhaps due to the thresholding.
1194.6 Class DBSCAN is parametrized by minimum number of neighbourhood points, epsilon size of the rectangular neighbourhood and threshold for choosing pixels.
1194.7 Logs are written to testlogs/DBSCANClustering.log.5January2022 which include number of clusters found and cluster labelled pixel dictionary.

1195.3 Degree Sequences are the reversed, sorted, monotone non-increasing values of the earlier dictionary of vertices to degrees. Degree Sequences of two callgraphs are matched by Wasserstein Earth Mover Distance similarity. 
1195.4 Identical Degree Sequences of 2 graphs are less costly approximations of their isomorphism (Isomorphism => Identical Degree Sequences but Identical Degree Sequences !=> Isomorphism).
1195.5 3 pairs of callgraphs - 2 dissimilar and 1 identical - are matched, degree sequences are verified by is_graphical() and their approximate isomorphism is printed as boolean and Earth Mover Distance values. Identical callgraphs of same executable-parameter have 0 EMD which might differ depending on cybercrime penetration if the callgraphs are situated across multiple compromised machines which are vertices of SIS model infection graph (Refer: 619.3).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1196.1 DBSCANClustering.py has been changed to implement a neural network thresholding of pixels in find_neighbours() and write_clustered_image() of DBSCAN algorithm. This feature has been made optional by a configurable parameter and original DBSCAN algorithm does not incorporate neural network thresholding in find_neighbours().
1196.2 New clauses based on boolean flag "neuralnetwork" have been introduced in both find_neighbours() and write_clustered_image() which evaluate a neural network passed on as lambda function argument and filter the pixels above or below a threshold color thus detecting clusters or communities of urban areas. 
1196.3 Function find_neighbours() computes neighbours satisfying the neural network while write_clustered_image() writes out the neural network clustered image to an image file suffixed "_neuralnetworkclustered.jpg". An option of choosing a square bounding box subset of an image has been provided in write_clustered_image() by "fraction" parameter which slices the image to subset square for invocation of find_neighbours() - epsilon neighbourhood is a percentage fraction of image dimension - so as to distinguish areas clustered and left unclustered by neural network lambda function.
1196.4 Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) image of Chennai Metropolitan area sprawl (of approximately 10000 square km by definition of metro sprawl in 1151 - semicircular sprawl covered by suburban train transport of 80 kms each in north,west and south) has been clustered by a simple neural network which weights each pixel by 2 for threshold value of 200. Clustered image has been written to GHSL_GIS_ChennaiMetropolitanArea_neuralnetworkclustered.jpg containing only densely populated localities excluding sparse suburbs and including composite city administrative area of 940 square km (Reference: GHSL convex hull and contour area estimator - R2019A - https://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ucdb2018visual.php) and adjoining dense suburbs mostly concentrated in west,north and south. Lambda function argument can be arbitrary string and can depend on many variables not just limited to pixel value alone, computable as expression by eval().
1196.5 Facebook High Resolution Settlement Layer (HRSL) Nighttime Streets imagery of world atlas - HRSL_World_NightTimeStreets.jpg - has been clustered by neural network thresholding - central 25% square fraction of image has been clustered and pixel colors of urban communities have been changed. Nighttime streets finetunes Nighttime lights urban area circles and is theoretically a graph of dotted streaks (edges) of streetlights in high resolution as against densely lit urban sprawl circles viewed from sky in VIIRS and MODIS. 
1196.6 Four colors of Urban sprawl could be deciphered from a partition of Nighttime Street Graph as follows (For 29 color Urban GIS segmentation in 1174.8.5, percentage luminosity could be attributed accordingly):
	1196.6.1 Manufacturing-IT-ITES - Vertices and Edges (Intersections and Streets) are extremely lit at night - highest electricity consumer
	1196.6.2 Commercial - Vertices and Edges (Intersections and Streets) are highly lit at night - higher electricity consumer
	1196.6.3 Residential - Vertices and Edges (Intersections and Streets) are less lit at night - high electricity consumer
	1196.6.4 Greenery - Vertices and Edges (Intersections and Streets) are not lit almost (another metric: Greenery could be found by Vegetation index - NDVI for urban centres - https://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ucdb2018visual.php) - minimal or no electricity consumed
1196.7 Neural network clustering is an independent feature (Continental US has been modelled by neural network extent learner for VIIRS and MODIS in 1175.12.8) which could be optionally used within DBSCAN find_neighbours(). Code invoking neural network clustering option in find_neighbours() has been commented within DBSCAN clustering().

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1201.1 DeepLearning_ConvolutionNetwork_BackPropagation.py has been updated to draw an animated HTML version of Delaunay Triangulation Mesh of a facial image by importing PyVis - https://pyvis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html#visualization.
1201.2 Delaunay Triangulation Mesh of a face aligns to 68 face landmarks and Bezier-like facets morphing of the Delaunay trimesh simulates the homeomorphic emotional deformations of the face (by changing facet areas) which is quintessential prerequisite for uniqueness of face irrespective of orientations. 
1201.3 Delaunay Trimesh for facial image is written to an html file suffixed "_FaceRecognition_Segmentation_FaceGraph.html". An option to exit after full isomorphism check without subgraph isomorphism test and iterating the isomorphic subgraphs by VF2 and ISMAGS (both subgraph isomorphism test and iterations are time consuming for some photos) has been introduced by setting isomorphism_iterations to 0 in facegraph_similarity_metrics(). 
1201.4 Two new images of the author - python-src/testlogs/Shrinivas_Kannan_01Sept2007_sitting.jpg (2007) and python-src/testlogs/SrinivasanKannan_alias_KaShrinivaasan_alias_ShrinivasKannan_photo.jpeg (2015) - have been added to pairwise graph isomorphism face similarity computation.
1201.5 Following are 6 isomorphic pairs of visuals (of 11 pairs of visuals of author) - from testlogs/DeepLearning_ConvolutionNetwork_BackPropagation.log.17January2022 which belong to 2015,2016 and 2017 while remaining non-isomorphic 5 pairs have atleast one older image:

1201.6 11 pairs of visuals earlier span 14 years from 2003 to 2017 and belong to 2003,2007,2015,2016,2017. As per decision tree in Section 1189,visuals of 2015,2016 and 2017 (short durations) are heavily similar while isomorphism wanes between 2003 to 2007 (false negatives). Previous results reasonably establish graph-isomorphic face recognition of visuals separated by short durations. 
1201.7 Approximate isomorphism test by faster_could_be_isomorphic() has been included in facegraph_similarity_metrics()

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1202.1 DeepLearning_ConvolutionNetwork_BackPropagation.py has been updated to loop through an array of images and compute pairwise face similarity by Graph Isomorphism (no subgraph isomorphism and iterations). Only full Isomorphism between Voronoi Facegraphs and Delaunay Trimesh(s) of a pair of images is being verified.
1202.2 8 face images of author are being matched for isomorphism spanning over a period of 19 years from 2003 to 2022. Images are of varied postures (passport,portrait-sitting,masked). New image testlogs/IMG_20220119_165911.jpg of the author wearing N95 COVID19 mask has been added to the computation to check if face isomorphism is recognized in disguise.
1202.3 Dlib shape detector fails to find 68 face landmarks for masked image testlogs/IMG_20220119_165911.jpg. Because of this an error condition is being handled to opt for contour centroids if 68 landmark centroids are not correctly found. Delaunay trimesh of testlogs/IMG_20220119_165911.jpg for contour centroids drawn by PyVis has been written to testlogs/IMG_20220119_165911_FaceRecognition_Segmentation_FaceGraph.html. PyVis drawn Delaunay Trimesh can be arbitrarily animated thus implementing a mesh deformation for arbitrary face expressions. PyVis mesh deformations can be non-planar. Voronoi Tessellation,Segmented Image and FaceGraph DOT files are written to:
	testlogs/IMG_20220119_165911-tessellated.jpg
	testlogs/IMG_20220119_165911_FaceRecognition_Segmentation_FaceGraph.dot
	testlogs/IMG_20220119_165911_segmented.jpg
1202.4 There are standard Mesh Deformation algorithms (As Rigid As Possible being one of them) for simulating the object animation and topological homeomorphic deformations in Computer Graphics. Identifying a face from its multiple mesh deformations is more accurate and harder than Graph Isomorphism recognition - facet areas change in addition to vertex renumbering.
1202.5 Logs for this update are written to testlogs/DeepLearning_ConvolutionNetwork_BackPropagation.log.21January2022. For 64 pairs of images (8*8), Full Graph Isomorphism is True for 19 pairs which is remarkable for a learner with no training priors. Subgraph isomorphism test has been avoided because of slowdown.

Goodrich · Ethan Kim · Rasmus Tamstorf - Walt Disney Studios] - "... The approximate topological matching is not the same as graph edit distance, however.

Thus, the approximate topological matching problem is an adaptation of the maximum common subgraph problem (22) to quad meshes, where we wish to match oriented quad faces as well as vertices and edges...." - Isomorphisms for bounded genus can be solved in linear time.

1204.1 SocialNetworkAnalysis_PeopleAnalytics_ChaoticHMM.py has been updated to persist dictionaries for Career State Machine and Designation classifications to SocialNetworkAnalysis_PeopleAnalytics_ChaoticHMM.json JSON backend and remove the hardcoded values.
1204.2 Viterbi Trellis computation has been corrected to find argmax for every state-observation and append to Viterbi trellis for printing to logs testlogs/SocialNetworkAnalysis_PeopleAnalytics_ChaoticHMM.log.27January2022. Career Transition computed by Chaotic HMM is correctly printed sequentially ignoring parallel tenures:

1204.3 SocialNetworkAnalysis_PeopleAnalytics_ChaoticHMM.json contains dictionaries for an example career transition (academic and work) of author spanning 40 years (1982-2022: parellel tenure of 23 years total work experience + parallel tenure of 23 years of academics for schooling and 3 degree qualifications) which includes parallel tenure of Open Source Software R&D initiative (Krishna iResearch: 2003-2022) spanning 19 years. Lamda of Chaotic HMM has been increased to 5.0. Serializing the parallel tenures has a weird implication of experience exceeding age of the candidate.
1204.4 Unique Identification of a profile is of utmost importance for choosing authentic candidates. Usual Face Recognition and Physique Recognition technologies may not be sufficient unless the career transition and financial history of the profile is authorized by a state issued unique ID (Section 711). Relocation history of a professional profile is a mobility measure associated with travel patterns - chronological sequence of cities where a candidate worked. Relocation timeline is a graph when a profile often relocates to a workplace of same urban centre. Frequent subgraphs or common subgraphs and average degree of Relocation travel pattern graphs is reflective of both personal preference and most prolific, economically thriving urban areas providing job opportunities where people gravitate or migrate to.
1204.5 Modelling Career Transition by PageRank further refines Markov model earlier by replacing websites by organizations. For a career transition probability column-stochastic matrix CT(N) and Initial state of P, following power iteration converges to stationary distribution:
	CT(N+1) = CT(N)*P
	Element (i,j) of CT(N) is the probability of state transitioning from organization i to organization j
	Stochastic Column Vector P is initialized to random probabilities. 
1204.6 Previous PageRank model ranks employee preference of corporate organizations quite similar to website rankings and is holistic and not employee specific. Usual "Best place to work" surveys are mostly intrinsic based on worklife quality metrics. 
1204.7 SocialNetworkAnalysis_PeopleAnalytics.py already implements a LinkedIn HR analytics for domain specific dictionary for Intrinsic Measurement of Technical Talent (Lines of Code for Information Technology Domain - Open Source Contribution and Corporate Individual Contribution) - such domain specific intrinsic parameters for measuring talent helps in automated recruitment of talent when both Question-Answering (Contests-Examinations-Interviews) and Majority Voting are prone to failures by human errors - thus in Bounded error complexity classes. Stability condition for BKS Conjecture to be true and Interview as LTF has been derived in Section 365. 
1204.8 Influence,Average Sensitivity and Noise Sensitivity of LTFs and PTFs are theoretical formalisms of human errors in Question-Answering (when a question or answer is corrupted by some probability). By Peres' Theorem Noise Sensitivity (NS(delta)) of LTF is upperbounded by 2*sqrt(delta) where delta is probability of flipping each bit (or) Pr(f(x) != f(y)) < 2*sqrt(delta) for x correlated to y by delta-probability flip per bit. From 1204.9 Average Sensitivity of PTF is upperbounded by AS(f) ≤ 2^O(d) · log n · n^(1−1/(4d+2)) for degree-d Polynomial Threshold Function in n variables. PTFs are better models of examinations as their coefficients are real-valued and thresholded by sign of polynomial evaluated (Kind of Pass or Fail). Conditions for Human Error in Majority Voting have been analyzed at length by Variants of CJT (p-bias of a voter SAT, Margulis-Ruzzo sharp Threshold at p-bias=0.5) which apply to PageRank as well. Equality of Average Sensitivity/Stability/Sensitivity/Influence of LTF-PTFs and Majority Decision Error of Condorcet Jury Theorem could be a Fame-Merit equilibrium point. Failure of both Question-Answering and Majority Voting by human error plays spoilsport in measuring the much touted "Employability" of a candidate and would necessitate inenvitably resorting to automated Talent analytics by historic intrinsic merit metrics - Academic qualifications (not necessarily examination scores), Skills e.g Total lines of code written, Lateral or Out-of-the-box thinking, Number of projects and teams managed, Independent Research and Development (Novelty Detection) - which are merit samples of huge durations thus minimizing error. Academic examinations,prone to failure by LTF-PTF sensitivities,as talent yardsticks for students might likewise have to be replaced by merit samples of wider ambit. Class of LTFs is learnable in poly(n/epsilon) or Questions for Answers are learnable in polynomial time (Answer-Questioning or anti-examination where students are supposed to ask questions for given answers, rationale being a person cannot ask questions unless (s)he has understanding of the answers). Limitations of various admission tests e.g SAT,GRE,TOEFL,IELTS have been reported and academic admissions are often decided based on Letter of Recommendations than admission test scores - a reallife instance of Recommender Systems.

The goal is to find a hypothesis h that minimizes the misclassification error Pr(x,y)∼D [h(x) 6= y]. ..... Halfspaces, or Linear Threshold Functions (henceforth LTFs), are Boolean functions f : R d → {±1} of the form f(x) = sign(hw, xi − θ), where w ∈ R d is the weight vector and θ ∈ R is the threshold.  (The function sign : R → {±1} is defined as sign(u) = 1 if u ≥ 0 and sign(u) = −1 otherwise.)

1205. (THEORY and FEATURE) Computational Geometric Factorization - Matplotlib plot of benchmarks - 300 integers from 100 to 400 and 20 integers from 500 to 520 - related to 1159 and all sections on Computational Geometric Factorization, Neural network learning of Factors by SAC=TC=NC=AC equivalence, Planar Point Location - 30 January 2022
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1205.1 New source file python-src/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized_MultipleIntegers.py has been committed to
iterate multiple integers sequentially over a range and time their computational geometric factorization durations by invoking python-src/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized.py within subprocess.call()
1205.2 NeuronRain Spark MapReduce implementation of Computational Geometric Factorization NC-PRAM-BSP algorithm by local binary search of rasterized hyperbolic arc bow segments is in complexity class Deterministic MRC, a software limitation. Time durations of computational geometric factorization of 300 integers from 100 to 400 and 20 integers from 500 to 520 are plotted against theoretical time of O(logN*logN) for depth-1 non-uniform Nick's Class circuit.
1205.3 python-src/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized_MultipleIntegers.py takes following commandline arguments in the order - minimum integer of the range,increment,depth of non-uniform NC circuit=exponent k of O((logN)^k),constant of Big-O and exponent of logN in the plot.
1205.4 It is hereby clarified that motive of Computational Geometric Factorization algorithm is to devise a polylogarithmic time integer factorization mechanism or a logdepth bounded fanin Nick's class circuit implemented by a cloud computing DMRC simulation of multicore-PRAMs which evidences existence of factorization algorithms in NC and not proving the lowerbound for factorization (e.g possibility of factorization by planar point location being present in a subset of NC cannot be ruled out - sublogarithmic time - since there are sequential sublogarithmic planar point location algorithms) which are two entirely different notions. That is precisely the reason for (ab)use of BigO notation throughout instead of Omega. 
1205.5 Equivalence of SAC=AC=NC=TC implies Nick's class parallel algorithms are learnable by Threshold circuits of majority gates or Neural networks - iterated factorization of sequential set of integers might serve as priors for further factorization. Example: Factorization of 39 as 39 = 13*3 might be a prior by substitution for factorization of 117=3*39=3*3*13 
1205.6 Two matlibplots python-src/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized_MultipleIntegers1.jpg (for integers 100 to 400,logdepth=1,BigOconstant=1,log exponent in plot=2) and python-src/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized_MultipleIntegers2.jpg (for integers 500 to 520,logdepth=1,BigOconstant=1,log exponent in plot=2) have been committed to AstroInfer repositories.
1205.7 Both the graphics depict the k*logN (k=1) actual runtimes of factorization (blue) far upperbounded by theoretical O((logN)^2) (red). Depth of circuit (parallel RAM time) has been differentiated from exponent of logarithm for graphic illustration (though both have to be equal by definition of NC). Previous runtime plots are for finding all factors (with and without multiplicity - Big Omega and Little Omega) which is a harder problem than finding just one factor.

1206. (THEORY and FEATURE) People Analytics - Social Network Analysis - Bipartite Social Networks (Matrimonial portals, Employer-Employee Professional networks) - Recommender Systems and Sentiment Analysis of Profiles for Ranking Preferences - related to 583,843 and all sections on Social Network Analysis,Clustering,Bipartite Matching, Gale-Shapley algorithm for Stable Marriage Problem and College Admission Problem, Online Citizen Science, Intrinsic Merit ranking of People profiles,Graph Isomorphism and Common Subgraph Problem,Recommender Systems,Unique Identification,Graphical models-Markov Random Fields and Belief Propagation,Hall's Marriage Theorem,Perfect Matching and Permanent of Bipartite graph - 31 January 2022
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1206.1 Matching Algorithms for finding complementary pairs of profiles (Match making) in bipartite 2-colored social networks have been studied as Bipartite matching problem and Stable Marriage Problem (Gale-Shapley algorithm). 
1206.2 Contrary to homogeneous social networks of Facebook and Twitter, match making social networks consist of 2 sets of vertices (Brides-Grooms,Employee-Employer,Male-Female) and profiles in each set have ranking preferences for their suitor in the other set.
1206.3 k-Nearest Neighbour Clustering of matrimonial profiles has been investigated as a Marriage Recommender Systems engine for suggesting profile vertices of closest match in set V2 for a profile vertex in set V1 of a bipartite social network G=(V1 union V2,E) - Reference 1206.8.
1206.4 Recursive Gloss Overlap Textgraphs of 2 Profile texts from sets V1 and V2 could be matched by Graph similarity measures - Graph Edit Distance,Netrd Graph Distance measures,Graph Isomorphism (Full-Subgraph-Approximate),Common Subgraph Algorithms - for percentage match of the profile textgraphs in bipartite sets V1 and V2 which could be a preliminary recommender systems screening criterion. 
1206.5 Unique Identification of a profile in match making is implicit necessity without stating to rule out bigamy. Gale-Shapley Stable Marriage Algorithm discovered in 1962 and awarded Nobel Prize in Economics 2012, has found variety of applications including National Resident Matching Program (https://www.nrmp.org/ for matching healthcare professionals to positions) and states: For equal number of men and women having ranking preferences, it is always possible to find a stable marriage match. A match of two vertices from sets V1 and V2 respectively is said to be stable if there is no pair (A,B) from sets V1 and V2 who prefer each other over their already matched partners. But Gale-Shapley algorithm is heavily tilted in favour of women who are allowed to ditch a current provisional partner found in previous round and choose a better man in next round and thus could be protested as asymmetric, unethical taint for marital sanctity. Thus Gale-Shapley algorithm may not be applicable in its exact sense to ethical matrimonial matching. Runtime of Gale-Shapley algorithm is O(n^2) for n men and n women. Hall's Marriage Theorem is another result which stipulates a condition for unique happy marriage:
	For two sets of n men and n women, and for subset I of n women, of Ai is the set of men i-th woman in set I prefers to marry, Sum|Ai| for all i in I >= |I| 
1206.6 Ranking preferences of a profile required as a preprocessing step by Gale-Shapley algorithm earlier is approximately a Sentiment analysis problem of the profile text or inferring expectations of profile vertices from text. An example matrimonial advertisement profile text of author in SentimentAnalyzer-BipartiteMatching-SocialNetworks.txt (Source advert JPG - Print Media - 2017: testlogs/SentimentAnalyzer-BipartiteMatching-SocialNetworks.IMG_20171111_135651.jpg) has been Deep-learnt to a Recursive Gloss Overlap TextGraph and analyzed for Empath and SentiWordNet sentiment by SentimentAnalyzer.py Belief Propagation and Markov Random Fields Graphical Model sentiment analysis functions which treat the textgraph as Graphical model having sentiment score potentials. Some small changes have been made to potential computation (multiplying by 2 for magnifying the scores, filter object of sentiwordnet synsets cast to list) 
1206.7 Excerpts of logs testlogs/SentimentAnalyzer.BipartiteMatchingSocialNetworks.log.31January2022 print the positivity,negativity and objectivity scores of the profile text - sample profile text is overwhelmingly objective from SentiWordNet and Empath sentiment analysis:
	==============================================================================
	Sentiment Analysis (Applying SentiWordNet to the tokenized text) of the text
	==============================================================================
	Positivity =  0.5
	Negativity =  0.125
	Objectivity =  12.375
	=======
	Empath:
	=======
	RGO Markov Random Fields - Empath positivity: 0.0
	RGO Markov Random Fields - Empath negativity: 0.0
	RGO Markov Random Fields - Empath objectivity: 1478.6871718142365
1206.8 Previous sentiment scores of a profile could be essential ingredients of a larger match recommender systems engine which clusters profiles of similar attitudes by their sentimental score euclidean distances or matches suiting profile vertex pairs (either by Gale-Shapley algorithm or Hall's marriage theorem) which are ranked by sentiment polarity.

1211. (THEORY and FEATURE) GIS Urban Sprawl Analytics - Population Density computation from Contour Pixel color coding - 4 February 2022 -

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1211.1 GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.py has been updated to compute Population of an urban sprawl contour extent from pixel color coding of the contour and points within the contour. Earlier population density was assumed to be a constant throughout the GIS visual which has been rectified in this code change.
1211.2 There are standard methodologies to find population density from GIS GeoTIFF which project the map pixel coordinates to longitude-latitude by GDAL Geo transformations and lookup the population density of a longitude-latitude from a GIS map service which is multiplied by contour area to get the population count. But the issue with GDAL is it is quite heavy to install and dependency requirements are huge causing C++ compile errors (GDAL is implemented in C++ and there are GLIBC version mismatch errors) and has been abandoned in favour of a simpler alternative.
1211.3 Simpler alternative implemented in this commit: 
	1211.3.1 Find the Blue-Green-Red color of a pixel in contour boundary of an urban sprawl
	1211.3.2 Average of BGR color is divided by 255 to get the ratio of pixel intensity - AverageBGR/255
	1211.3.3 Average BGR color pixel intensity ratio is multiplied by highest population density of an urban sprawl in the world to get approximate estimate of population density of an urban sprawl contour (e.g Barcelona,Spain and Los Angeles,The US are the densest in world) - 100000 per square kilometre (Assumption: Pixel colors graded from 0 to 255 map from lowest population density to highest population density range which is the convention followed by GHSL,SEDAC,HRSL)
1211.4 Function urban_sprawl_from_segments() is invoked for Meta-Facebook High Resolution Settlement Layer World Nighttime Streets image - testlogs/HRSL_World_NightTimeStreets.jpg - by setting population density as -1 a flag implying population density is internally computed. 
1211.5 Following are the logs, facegraph DOT file and convex hull-contour-segment-facegraph images created - Logs testlogs/GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.log.4February2022 print the contour boundary point chosen for pixel color computation and the approximate populations of urban sprawl contour areas(not necessarily close to actual populations because area of a pixel may not be 1 square km exactly as contour area to square km conversion is computed by a heuristic training data in 1175, but quite useful for rankings by proportionality):

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1212.1 GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.py has been updated to compute population count from a Legend Dictionary through additional argument "legend" to urban_sprawl_from_segments() which is a dictionary of average RGB pixel colors to population range strings of the form "<minimum>-<maximum>"
1212.2 If no legend dictionary is available,population density computation defaults to proportional density based on pixel color having 100000 as maximum. It is upto the invoking function to suitably populate the legend dictionary and mapscale for contour area to square kilometer conversion. An example legend dict for Meta High Resolution Settlement Layer Map testlogs/HRSL_World_NightTimeStreets.jpg has been passed on to urban_sprawl_from_segments() as mapping of RGB averages for color gradings - Yellow1,Yellow2,Yellow3,Orange1,Orange2,Orange3,Red1 - to population ranges. Mapscale could be either set to HRSL legend ratio of 1:147914382 or NeuronRain heuristic of 266.0/854.0 for urban sprawl contour area to square kilometre conversion:
	legend={235/3:"0-1",245/3:"1-50",255/3:"50-100",362/3:"100-250",372/3:"250-1000",382/3:"1000-2500",510/3:"2500-27057"}
	mapscale=147914382
    	#mapscale=266.0/854.0
    	urban_sprawl_from_segments("testlogs/HRSL_World_NightTimeStreets.jpg",seg9,-1,mapscale,legend)
1212.3 urban_sprawl_from_legends() iterates through legend dictionary to find matching color range for an average RGB value of contour boundary pixel - it is not a key lookup in exact sense, but a range query for color range which contains the average RGB value e.g an average RGB value of 300/3 would be matched by 255/3 - 362/3 bracket.
1212.4 Use of mapscale from HRSL (mapscale=147914382) as multiplicand magnifies the urban sprawl area and population values thus facilitating better ranking.

Success probability of Randomized Proof of Work algorithm (for finding 2 leading fs) earlier is 16^(m-2)/16^m = 1/256 for m hexadecimal digit UUIDs (number of m-2 hex digit substrings / number of m hex digit strings). 
1213.2 Hardness of Proof of Work computation is crucial in assigning value to mined cryptocurrency (another economic merit measure).

NP-Complete problems and harder classes of EXP,PSPACE problems are computational formulations of valuable commodities - in a way a reincarnation of Adam Smith-Ricardo Labour theory of value as Computational Theory of value. Lot of NP-complete problems have been studied as candidates for Cryptocurrency proof of work algorithms. Proof of P=NP could raise questions on hardness of Cryptocurrency Proof of Work mining rigs.
1213.3 Going by earlier line of reasoning, Tower of Hanoi problem of moving disks preserving order could be the hardest Cryptocurrency proof of work algorithm potentially consuming entire lifetime of universe for [2^n - 1] moves (mostly n=64) - even a partial version of Towers of Hanoi which moves some percentage of disks could be a quantifier of proof of work.
1213.4 Earth Mover Distance for set partitions and histograms formalizes the notion of moving a mass of histogram to morph it to another set partition histogram. Towers of Hanoi is a single bin ordered histogram of sorted disks of descending radii from bottom to top. If Earth Mover Distance definition could be adapted to Towers of Hanoi problem of moving disks (which is a problem of moving conical 3D ordered histogram of single bin containing sorted disks of various radii decreasing from bottom to top from one place to other - moving a histogram to itself - a fixed point computation f(h)=h), a Towers of Hanoi EMD algorithm could be a proof of work alternative for Neuro Cryptocurrency of formidable hardness. Intuitively EMD for Single bucket Towers of Hanoi Ordered Histogram must be exponentially hard to compute. 
1213.5 Neuro Perfect Forward C++ cloud move implementation of Cryptocurrency protobuf objects within an OpenSSL tunnel follows C++ idiom of zero-copy move and perfect forward (no change to argument value - immutable) as against copy-delete object move simulation in most cloud providers. Transactional move is assured by Software Transactional Memory in most C++ compilers or could be filled in by XA 2-phase commit consensus managers e.g Sun Microsystems-Oracle GlassFish AppServer JTS XA - https://github.com/javaee/glassfish/tree/master/appserver/transaction/jts. An EventNet global consensus hyperledger appends a vertex and edge (Buyer-Seller - equivalent of a block in blockchain) for every Neuro cryptocurrency mined and awarded thus tracking money trail.
1213.6 Pure computer science theoretic algorithms for proof of work are delinked from value oriented hardness computation of commodities. Commodity linked Proof of Work would make Neuro cryptocurrency more meaningful tender. In other words, hardness of mining one unit of Neuro cryptocurrency should be directly proportional to hardness (labour involved) of creating commodity from scratch (akin to Doctrines of Labour Theory of Value, Reductionism, Macroeconomics in terms of microeconomics and erstwhile Gold standard).
1213.7 An example Commodity linked Proof of work algorithm for Neuro: Neuro Value of a commodity is determined by hardness of computational simulation of producing the commodity from scratch - e.g Neuro Value of 1 kilogram of wheat or 1 metre of cloth is decided by hardness of algorithmic simulation of producing 1 kilogram of wheat or 1 metre of cloth from first principles (Wages + constituent materials from crop to market).

They consume little more than the poor, and in spite of their natural selfishness and rapacity, though they mean only their own conveniency, though the sole end which they propose from the labours of all the thousands whom they employ, be the gratification of their own vain and insatiable desires, they divide with the poor the produce of all their improvements...They are led by an invisible hand to make nearly the same distribution of the necessaries of life, which would have been made, had the earth been divided into equal portions among all its inhabitants, and thus without intending it, without knowing it, advance the interest of the society, and afford means to the multiplication of the species. When Providence divided the earth among a few lordly masters, it neither forgot nor abandoned those who seemed to have been left out in the partition...."

(THEORY and FEATURE) Computational Geometric Integer Factorization - 20523 bits quadcore benchmarks - Factorization as a non-trivial Proof of Work computation for Neuro Cryptocurrency mining rig - related to 620,713,728,739,1158,1159,1161,1213 and all sections on Neuro Cryptocurrency, Computational Geometric Factorization, Set Partitions to Exact Square Tile Cover Reduction by Lagrange Sum of 4 Squares - Optimal denominations and Money Changing Problem, Integer Partitions, Equidepth-Equiheight V-Optimal Histograms and Set partition analytics, Drone Electronic Voting Machines - 9 February 2022

1214.1 Non-trivial proof of work computation requirement for mining Neuro cryptocurrency could be satisfied by hardness of factoring large integers on MapReduce-BSP-Multicore-PRAM platforms - mostly semi primes and integers of low prime factors (Little Omega and Big Omega) - which are Nick's class and MRC formalisms and not NP-complete.
1214.2 Integer factorizations have been demonstrated earlier as side-effects of Equidepth-Equiheight Histograms, Set partitions to Lagrange Sum of Squares Tile cover reduction and Money Changing Problem for Optimal Denominations (Frobenius Diophantine Coin Problem) - Denominations which are decimal multiples of 1,2,5 and importance of 18 cent piece - any integral Neuro currency value can be expressed as integer partition or linear combination of multiples of denominations 1,2,5:
	Example: 18 = 1*1 + 1*2 + 3*5
1214.3 Set partition to Lagrangian Sum of Squares Tile Cover reduction results in two linear diophantine equations for each side of the rectangle (of area N=pq) which are equated to factorized pair p and q (each factor is a sum of sides of squares covering the rectangle) thus solving Money Changing Problem - Section 1161 exactly solves the two linear integer program Money Changing Problem diophantines (NP-Complete problem) by CVXOPT GLPK and Section 728 approximately solves these by polynomial time LSMR:
	 optimize c1 + c2 + c3 + ... + cn
         subject to:
              c1*x1 + c2*x2 + ... + ck*xk + ... + cn*xn = p
              d1*x1 + d2*x2 + ... + dk*xk + ... + dn*xn = q
              c1 >= 0, c2 >= 0, ..., cn >= 0
	      di are some functions or permutations of ci
1214.4 A random 20523 bits integer has been factorized (small prime factor 7 and a huge factor) in less than 15 minutes which is the largest integer factorized by NeuronRain so far. Advantage of Factorization as proof of work is the parametrizable complexity - Hardness of or Time consumed by Proof of Work can be configured by choosing integers of low prime factors (from number theoretic estimates - Hardy-Ramanujan,Prime Number Theorem,Baker-Harman-Pintz,Cramer,Zhang ray shooting queries) - Integers of low prime factors tend to increase hardness of factorization and viceversa:

1214.5 Fed issued Paper Currency unique IDs have been proposed earlier as non-digital One Time Passwords for VREPAT Drone Electronic Voting Machines implemented in NeuronRain to ensure uniqueness of a vote cast. Neuro Boost UUIDs of the format <UUID>:<denomination> e.g ff20a894-a2c4-4002-ac39-93d053ea3020:100 are 512 bit long (plus bit size for denomination - longer than most currency unique IDs) and could catapult voting accuracy in spite of being digital. 
1214.6 Logs for 20523 bits integer factorization are at DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized.log.9February2022. Factorization of 20523 bits required a non-uniform NC circuit of depth k=1432 or O(N/(logN)^k) = O(2^20523/20523^1432) = O(2^10) = 1024 multicores, a quite usual number in MapReduce clouds and 1024 cores have been simulated on 4 cores in this factorization - it has to be noted that if MapReduce is implemented on a Single node cluster of multicores communication complexity is negligible.
1214.7 Earlier Proof-of-Work computation by Set partition to square tile cover which is a combination of (*) factorization of a rectangular area equal to size of a set partition (*) and money changing problem solutions for the two factors found, achieves 2 goals at a time - (1) mining a unit of Neuro cryptocurrency (2) expressing the mined currency in terms of optimal denominations e.g Rectangular area (= Value of Neuro currency mined) could be set to a function of 1,2 and 5: N = (a1 + 2*a2 + 5*a3)*(b1 + 2*b2 + 5*b3).

1215. (THEORY and FEATURE) Set Partition Analytics - Set Partition-Rectangular Area to Factorization reduction and Integer Linear Program solution of Frobenius Coin Diophantines for Neuro Cryptocurrency mining rig Proof of Work, One Time Password facility augmented for Voter Received Encrypted Paper Audit Trail (VREPAT) Conceptual Drone Electronic Voting Machine - related to 135,562,1140 and all sections on Money Changing Problem,Optimal Denominations,Integer Partitions, Computational Economics - Computational Hardness (Labour) Theory of Value, Histogram and Set Partition analytics, Equidepth-Equiheight Histograms, Separate Chaining Hashtables, Drone EVMs, Space Filling and Teapot Shards, Equal and Unequal Circle packing, Grid filling, Integer Linear Programming and Cellular automata, Quantum Versus Classical Computation, Parallel Pseudorandom Generators, Berry-Esseen Central Limit Theorem - 11 February 2022
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1215.1 Streaming_SetPartitionAnalytics.py has been updated to change following functions to expand their scope to Neuro Cryptocurrency Proof of Work (NeuroFed) and Drone EVM one time password padding facility respectively:
	def setpartition_to_tilecover(histogram_partition=None, number_to_factorize=1, solution="ILP",Neuro_Crypto_ProofOfWork=False)
	def electronic_voting_machine(Voting_Machine_dict, unique_id, voted_for, Streaming_Analytics_Bertrand=False, onetimepassword=None)
1215.2 setpartition_to_tilecover() now accepts an additional boolean flag Neuro_Crypto_ProofOfWork to treat the number_to_factorize argument as a Neuro Currency of same value and factorize the Currency value N=pq to obtain two Frobenius Money Changing Coin Diophantines which are equated to factor pairs p and q.
1215.3 Integer Linear Program CVXOPT GLPK solutions for the two diophantines are printed to partition the Neuro currency as sum of multiples of denominations. Computational Theory of Value (a rephrasal of Labour Theory of Value) equates Hardness of the supply chain producing 1 unit of commodity from raw materials to market and its commercial value.
1215.4 Agriculture usecase supply chain following Samuleson-Stolper convention : Seeds - Land rental - Farm labour wages - Water - Materials - End product. Computationally, agriculture is a Space filling problem of randomly sowing seeds in a 2 dimensional plane and their probability of fructification (a la Teapot Shards model) - Seeds parallelly sprout and grow ordained by a probability distribution of ordinates from nature's parallel pseudorandom generator (invisible hand of providence) and thus could be in NC or Randomized NC (Tygar-Reif Parallel PRG, Applebaum PRG in NC1 with linear stretch could churn out ordinates for seeds in parallel - NC - and only some randomly chosen seeds sprout in parallel - RNC). Finding total number of successfully sprouted seeds is tantamount to sum of random variables for the seed ordinates which tends to mean by Central Limit Theorem. 
1215.5 electronic_voting_machine() now accepts an argument for One Time Password presumably a serial number of paper currency or Neuro Cryptocurrency Boost 512 bit UUID which is appended optionally to ripemd160 digest of Voter's public id context string. Defeating this uniqueness salting of an anonymous vote at a Drone polling terminal is as hard as counterfeiting of currency - paper or digital. 
1215.6 Passlib SHA256 encrypt() has been deprecated and replaced by hash() while appending to a candidate's votes bin.
1215.7 Clauses have been introduced to differentiate Set partition to square tile cover reduction and Neuro Cryptocurrency proof of work.An example Neuro currency of #8375 has been mined by Factorizing 8375 (Neuro currency has been assigned a logo "#" to distinguish it from legal tenders). SymPy Random integer partition of the Neuro currency value is reduced to a rectangle and then factorized. Logs testlogs/Streaming_SetPartitionAnalytics.Python3.9Upgrade.NeuroProofOfWorkILP.log.11February2022 print the minted Neuro Cryptocurrency and its optimal denominations as sum of products. 
1215.8 Earlier factorization based Neuro mint could be optimized by reducing 2 Money Changing Diophantines to 1 if area of the rectangle is a huge prime integer > 2 (or) Prime valued Neuro currency equal to rectangular area is minted. One of the two factors is 1 and diophantine for it is trivially solved.
1215.9 Quantum NC algorithm for factorization in Section 562 implies Neuro cryptocurrency could be mined by Quantum circuits.

(THEORY and FEATURE) Fictitious Neuro Cryptocurrency Mining Rig - Random Integer Partition + Rectangular Area Factorization + Money Changing Problem Proof of Work - Digital Watermarking implementation for Visual Neuro cryptocurrency - 15 February 2022 - related to 112,113,114,488,751,784,785,787,791,841,848,859,1095(a,b,c,d),1215,1216 and all sections on Economic merit, Set Partition analytics, Pseudorandom generators, Computational Geometric Factorization, Money Changing Problem - Frobenius Coin Diophantines, Computational Theory of Value, Poverty Alleviation, Neuro Cryptocurrency implementations in AstroInfer and KingCobra, Optimal Denominations,Computational Economics - Computational Hardness (Labour) Theory of Value, Histogram and Set Partition analytics, Equidepth-Equiheight Histograms, Separate Chaining Hashtables, Timeout gadgets (Refcounted Expirable C++ objects, KingCobra atomic refcounting and Survival Index Timeout) in NeuronRain, Digital Watermarking, Drone Electronic Voting Machines, Numeric Compression by Prime power encoding - Unique Factorization Domain, Multiplicative Partitions, Compressed Sensing (Succinct representation), Large Scale Visuals, Cybercrime analytics
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
1217.1 Neuro Cryptocurrency Mining Rig in Streaming_SetPartitionAnalytics.py has been augmented to print a visual Neuro currency which is digitally signed by Digital Watermarking OpenCV2 overlay of Neuro currency symbol (single strikethrough-N) and name. 
1217.2 Digital Watermark is a configurable image in testlogs/NeuroCurrencyWatermark.jpg (contains Neuro name and symbol). Blank cleanslate currency template is stored in testlogs/NeuroCurrencyTemplate.jpg. Neuro cryptocurrency mint proof of work, a combination of Random Integer Partition + Lagrange Sum-of-squares Partition-to-Rectangular Area Reduction and Factorization + Money Changing Problem (BPP pseudorandom choice of an integer partition from SymPy, MRC or NC factorization of Lagrange Sum-of-squares Integer Partition-to-Rectangular Area Reduction, NP-Complete solutions to two Money Changing Problem Frobenius Coin Diophantine Integer Linear Programs equated to factor sides of the rectangle - and thus effectively a non-trivial pipeline of BPP + MRC-NC + NP) computes the factor sides of the rectangle equal to value of Neuro cryptocurrency and solves two ILPs.
1217.3 All factors of the integer factorized (= value of Neuro cryptocurrency mined) are concatenated and encrypted to SHA256 cryptographic hash as UUID of the currency - Currency value and SHA256 UUID are written to testlogs/NeuroCryptoCurrency.jpg based on template testlogs/NeuroCurrencyTemplate.jpg by OpenCV2 putText(). 2 leading "ff"s requirement as non-trivial Proof of Work in a pseudorandomly chosen Boost UUID is thus relaxed theoretically by uniqueness of integer factorization into multiplicative partition of prime powers (Factorisatio Numerorum) which has been already implemented in NeuronRain Grafit in the context of compressed succinct storage of a huge integer. Euclidean Semiprimes could be an apt choice as currency values as they could be factored into 2 primes and solved for 2 Money Changing ILPs.
1217.4 Visual Neuro Currency object testlogs/NeuroCryptoCurrency.jpg thus dynamically printed is watermarked by testlogs/NeuroCurrencyWatermark.jpg and written to testlogs/NeuroCryptoCurrency.jpg_Watermarked.jpg by watermark_image() function of DigitalWatermarking.py implementation in NeuronRain Grafit. An example Neuro Visual Currency Note of value 100 and SHA256 UUID watermarked by Neuro symbol and name backdrop is unveiled at testlogs/NeuroCryptoCurrency.jpg_Watermarked.jpg.
1217.5 Proof of work computation earlier has been captured in testlogs/Streaming_SetPartitionAnalytics.NeuroCryptocurrencyWatermarking.log.15February2022. Some commented code on EVM analytics has been uncommented to regenerate JSON persisted Drone EVMs - testlogs/Streaming_SetPartitionAnalytics.EVMs.json
1217.6 Expirable C++ Objects which could be timed out or expired by reference counting have been implemented in NeuronRain AstroInfer cpp-src/expirable/ and described theoretically in Conceptual Survival Index Timeout WCET OS Scheduler and KingCobra Message-As-Currency Atomic transactional Refcounting (over cloud) within KingCobra linux kernel driver. Refcounting is a bidirectional logical clocktick for objects oscillated by increment and decrement - objects are garbage collected by reaper when refcount is 0. C++ expirable objects which were meant originally for limiting number of views of an Image object (e.g a photo sent over email self-destructs after constant number of views,a privacy feature most sought after),could be suitably used for Visual Cryptocurrency sent over networks as add-on security to limit the transactions involving a currency ID.
1217.7 Neuro Cryptocurrency mining rigs theoretically demonstrated earlier try to equate value of a currency in terms of Hardness of computation and simulated value of a commodity which is producible by similar real-life hardness and are potential poverty eradication tools.
1217.8 Section 1357 (NeuronRain Grafit repositories) implements a userspace Dynamic Hashmap Survival Index SCHED_DEADLINE Worst Case Execution Time (WCET) Linux Scheduler (an alternative to traditional timer wheel ring buffer datastructures which periodically sweep the circular linkedlist of processes by roundrobin clockwork decrementing a timer value and reap expired processes) which could communicate with VIRGO Linux kernel through VIRGO kernel_analytics driver. Worst case execution time of a process could be estimated by any WCET analysis algorithm, master theorem (if algorithm of process binary is known) or by Busy Beaver number of Turing Machine of a process binary (by compilers which translate high level language code to BrainFuck Turing Machine encoding) that writes most 1s to a tape (or runs for longest possible time for n Turing machine states). Survival Index scheduler implementation could be used for refcounting and timing out object IDs (self-destructing images, cryptocurrencies with upper limit on number of transactions or finite length money trail) instead of process IDs (described in 1217.6).
1217.9 Worst case execution time for chrt SCHED_DEADLINE commandline in Survival Index scheduler (1217.8), though undecidable in theory by reduction from Halting problem, can be naively estimated by size (total number of CPU instructions) of process binary. Top 2 high level languages, Python and Java, are byte code compiled and run on virtual machines abstracting CPU instruction sets. Naive static WCET of a process binary (neglecting periodicities-runtime loops) could be defined as:
	Naive WCET < Sum of clock cycles for all CPU or bytecode instructions in a process binary

1218. (THEORY and FEATURE) Music Synthesizer - Python 3.8 upgrade and Fractal implementation - 21 February 2022 - related to 3,298,642,643,644,659,681,1124 and all sections on Intrinsic Merit of Music, MIR(Music Information Retrieval), Music Similarity and Clustering, AI Music Synthesis, fMRI connectomes - OpenNeuro - Psychology of music, Weighted automata, Chaos, Deep Learning, Timeseries analysis, Physique recognition and Motion capturing algorithms, SETH
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1218.1 Music Synthesizer in python-src/music_pattern_mining/AudioToBitMatrix.py (from Functions,Automata and Randomness) has been enhanced to
generate music notes waveform from a fractal dataset. It has also been upgraded to Python 3.8 by 2to3 and autopep8.
1218.2 Function notes_to_audio() has been updated to include additional boolean argument for enabling fractal waveform and a clause for computing the chaotic Mandelbrot set (Real only) from a logistic function. Samplerate and Amplitude for the waveform have been set accordingly for loading .wav file in Audacity. Fractal set of notes is grown within a loop of eval() by feedback. 
1218.3 Fractal music waveform is written to separate .wav file - function_synthesized_music_fractal.wav. Scaled notes are cast to NumPy int16.
1218.4 Amplitude is multiplied by array of notes by NumPy Array broadcast throughout for all types of music synthesis - function,fractal,automata and randomness. Music waveform has been sufficiently amplified now and audible in Audacity. Waveform could be loaded in Audacity and analyzed visually by zooming the track.
1218.5 Three invocations of music synthesizer below respectively generate music from a quadratic equation, sinusoid and a Fractal Verhulste-Pearl-Reed(VPR) logistic function :
    	notes_to_audio(function='(x*x+x+1) % 32767',fractal=False)
    	notes_to_audio(function='int(math.sin(x*x+x+1) * 32767)',fractal=False)
    	notes_to_audio(function='5*(x*x-x) % 32767')
1218.6 Following are logs and music waveforms synthesized from finite state automaton,function,randomness and fractals:
	automaton_synthesized_music.wav
	function_synthesized_music.wav
	notes_synthesized_music.wav
	function_synthesized_music_fractal.wav
	testlogs/AudioToBitMatrix.log.MusicSynthesizer.21February2022
1218.7 Similarity between two music waveforms is often computed by Dynamic Time Warping Algorithm, a monotonically increasing match of indices from first sequence to those in second sequence, and by Longest Common Subsequence algorithm. There is no subquadratic algorithm for Dynamic Time Warping unless SETH is False.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1219.1 AudioToBitMatrix.py has been updated to define a new function dynamic_time_warping() implementing Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) Timeseries sequence similarity algorithm that could find use as broad-spectrum routine across whole gamut of sequence similarity analytics - stock quote timeseries, trimesh-quadmesh sequences of human physiques from motion captures of CCTV footages, DNA multiple sequence alignment, string matching - longest common subsequence among others. Granger causality (timeseries of stockA causing timeseries of another stockB separated by time duration) between two stock quote time series could be found by DTW similarity across timelines and Graphical Event Model of stocks could be established.
1219.2 Reference pseudocode from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_time_warping has been translated to NumPy Python 3.8 function dynamic_time_warping() - in a nutshell this function grows a dynamic programming memoization tableau and populates it by cost minimization function:
	dtw[i, j] = cost + min([dtw[i-1, j], dtw[i, j-1], dtw[i-1, j-1]])
1219.3 Two example audio clips - ./testlogs/JSBach_Musicological_Offering.mp4, ./testlogs/AudioGraphExample_SpeechRecognition_2019-07-09-103018.wav have been compared by Dynamic Time Warping and logs are available at python-src/music_pattern_mining/testlogs/AudioToBitMatrix.log.DynamicTimeWarping.23February2022
1219.4 Function audio_distance() has been changed to include a clause and boolean flag argument for enabling dynamic time warping.
1219.5 Earlier audio clips have been curtailed to 0.01 duration each as np.array() from librosa returned notes are memory hogging (requires few GBs). DTW is a music clustering distance metric quite apt to define creativity and original music score - pattern or style in one's own work and dissimilarity to the rest - a foremost prerequisite for Novelty Detection.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
1220.1 Function audio_to_notes() in AudioToBitMatrix.py has been updated to learn a degree 5 polynomial from raw music waveform timeseries returned by librosa. NumPy polyfit() is invoked on the music waveform notes array to fit a degree 5 polynomial. 
1220.2 Theoretically distance between 2 music waveform timeseries found by Dynamic Time Warping and inner product distance between polynomials of 2 music waveforms f and g - <f,g>=DefiniteIntegral(f(x)g(x)dx) must coincide or be proportional. Novelty or Originality or Similarity of  a music score is therefore quantified algebraically though somewhat superficial ignoring the graph structure found by Weighted Automata.
1220.3 Exception in hertz to note function - librosa.hz_to_note() - of librosa has been handled.
1220.4 Following 3 instrumental MP4 music clips of different genres (MP3 files have been upgraded to MP4 as librosa fails to load MP3) - Orient and Western classical - JS Bach and S Balachander in Veena (Amritavarshini) - have been fit to music waveform polynomials and printed to testlogs/AudioToBitMatrix.log.PolyFit.25February2022:
	notes1 = audio_to_notes("testlogs/JSBach_Musicological_Offering.mp4",dur=20)
	notes2 = audio_to_notes("testlogs/054-SBC-Aanandhamridhakarshini.mp4", dur=20)
	notes3 = audio_to_notes("testlogs/Bach_Flute_Sonata_EFlat.mp4", dur=20)
1220.5 Following are the coefficients of the degree 5 polynomials learnt for clips earlier in order:
	polynomial learnt from raw audio-music waveform: [ 1.86408187e-29 -2.44250264e-23  1.12197649e-17 -2.12257382e-12 1.52604679e-07  2.37511803e-03]

1220.6 Novelty Detection or Originality of a Music Score is quantifiable by clustering of music waveforms either by Dynamic Time Warping distances among them or inner product distances of Quintic degree 5 polynomials learnt from music waveforms earlier. Style/Touch/Creative Genius of a composer is the extent of clustering observed in one's own work and how much of an outlier it is from the rest.

1221. (THEORY and FEATURE) Fictitious Neuro Cryptocurrency NP-Hard Proof of Work - Moving Mount Fuji - Single Bin Sorted LIFO Histogram - Towers of Hanoi - implementation - 28 February 2022 - related to 112,113,114,488,751,784,785,787,791,841,848,859,1095(a,b,c,d),1209,1215,1216,1217 and all sections on Economic merit, Set Partition analytics, Pseudorandom generators, Computational Geometric Factorization, Money Changing Problem - Frobenius Coin Diophantines, Computational Theory of Value, Poverty Alleviation, Neuro Cryptocurrency implementations in AstroInfer and KingCobra, Optimal Denominations,Computational Economics - Computational Hardness (Labour) Theory of Value, Histogram and Set Partition analytics, Equidepth-Equiheight Histograms, Separate Chaining Hashtables, Timeout gadgets (Refcounted Expirable C++ objects, KingCobra atomic refcounting and Survival Index Timeout) in NeuronRain, Digital Watermarking, Drone Electronic Voting Machines, Numeric Compression by Prime power encoding - Unique Factorization Domain, Multiplicative Partitions, Compressed Sensing (Succinct representation), Large Scale Visuals, Cybercrime analytics, Russian Peasant's Linear Complexity Multiplication Algorithm, K Dimensional Trees, Computer Graphics, Collatz Conjecture, Mandelbrot sets, Earth Mover Distance, Graphical Event Models and Stock Timeseries, AI Music Synthesis
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1221.1 Streaming_SetPartitionAnalytics.py has been changed to define a new function single_bin_sorted_LIFO_histogram_ToH() for computing all order preserving moves of a single bin sorted LIFO histogram (a k-d tree or mountain sliced to horizontal disks in 3 dimensions) as Neuro Cryptocurrency Rig Proof of Work - Towers of Hanoi (or Towers of Brahma) - which is NP-Hard (not NP-Complete as no NP algorithm for Towers of Hanoi problem has been found yet). 
1221.2 Set Partitions to Lagrange Sum of Squares Tile Cover of a Rectangle reduction + Computational Geometric Factorization + Money Changing Problem-Integer Linear Programming Proof of Work implementation earlier is NP-Complete and its hardness is subject to P != NP while NP-Hard class is independent of P != NP and universally present as even undecidable problems are NP-Hard (Halting problem).
1221.3 Function single_bin_sorted_LIFO_histogram_ToH() internally invokes print_Towers_of_Hanoi() routine recursively for n disks and 3 bins (source,destination and intermediary) and computes Earth mover distance between those triples after every move. Earth mover distance triples and 3 Towers are printed to logs testlogs/Streaming_SetPartitionAnalytics.TowersOfHanoi.NeuroProofOfWork.28February2022 after computing pairwise wasserstein_distance() triples for all O(2^n) moves.
1221.4 Towers of Hanoi algorithm is based on following pseudocode 2-part recursion for moving top n-1 disks from source x to destination z and source z to destination y having y and x as intermediaries respectively:
	single_bin_sorted_LIFO_histogram_ToH(n-1,x,z,y)
	single_bin_sorted_LIFO_histogram_ToH(n-1,z,y,x)
1221.5 Earth Mover Distance Triples printed sinusoidally fluctuate and always end in 0 exhibiting Collatz sequence behavior and are thus simulators for many naturally arising timeseries Graphical Event Model sequences - bidirectional object refcounting clockticks, Stock quote tickers et al. Stock quote timeseries influenced by high frequency algorithmic trading and manual trading platforms have been simulated by multifractals, Mandelbrot sets, Irrational exuberance and Bounded rationality. Undecidability of Mandelbrot sets implies prediction of market volatility is intractable. Towers of Hanoi and Earth Mover Distance are personifications for any human labour involving mass movement and formalize hardness in terms of simulated labour. Rhythmic ebb and tide of Towers of Hanoi EMD sequence makes it a candidate music waveform for AI Music Synthesis and the undulating histograms printed in intermediate steps are corresponding spectrograms of it. Following are the set of EMD triples for last few Towers of Hanoi POW computation steps grepped from testlogs/Streaming_SetPartitionAnalytics.TowersOfHanoi.NeuroProofOfWork.28February2022 ending in (0,0,0) for 3 towers:
Pairwise ToH Earth Mover Distance Triple: (4.166666666666667, 2.0, 3.166666666666667)
Pairwise ToH Earth Mover Distance Triple: (5.5, 2.5, 3.0)

1221.6 Function single_bin_sorted_LIFO_histogram_ToH() prints a digital-watermarked Visual Neuro currency after completion of Towers of Hanoi proof of work. Following are the Neuro currency visuals for an example denomination:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1223.1 notes_to_audio() function in AudioToBitMatrix.py has been changed to synthesize notes from python 3.8 lambda expression and map() instead of a list comprehension earlier.
1223.2 Lambda expression for any mathematical function is repetitively evaluated within a loop and notes are appended to get an onset-to-onset periodic music waveform timeseries.
1223.3 There has been sufficient publication prior art analyzing feasibility of speech synthesis from summation of damped sinusoid waveforms for simulating human utterances of syllables. Damped Sinusoid summation has been implemented for music synthesis equivalent in this commit. In a sense, summation of damped sinusoids is the Time domain converse of Fourier spectrum decomposition of music waveform into set of frequencies in Frequency domain. 
1223.4 notes_to_audio() synthesizer is invoked for a sum of damped sinusoids and an instrumental music waveform simulating thunderbolt has been composed (function_synthesized_music.wav):
	notes_to_audio(function='((np.iinfo(np.int16).max/(1+x))*math.sin(2*3.1428/720*x) + (np.iinfo(np.int16).max/(1+x))*math.sin(2*3.1428/1240*x) + (np.iinfo(np.int16).max/(1+x))*math.sin(2*3.1428/2400*x))', fractal=False)
corresponding to sum of three damped oscillator waveform frequencies of the form a/(b + x)*sin(2*pi*x/c)
1223.5 Earlier summation combines 3 damped sinusoids of frequencies 720,1240 and 2400 Hz into a natural rhythmic music. Music waveforms (especially orient) have a distinct periodic damping feature (notable difference could be visually felt by loading testlogs/054-SBC-Aanandhamridhakarshini.mp4 and testlogs/Bach_Flute_Sonata_EFlat.mp4 in Audacity - former has an intriguingly self-similar periodic damped sinusoidal structure)
1223.6 There have been raging debates on credibility of music synthesis and an orthodox view avers that music cannot be invented but could only be discovered (a notion strikingly similar to "Straight from the Book" of Erdos - Theorems are not invented but only discovered). As a trivia, Permutation of heptatonic scale allows only 5040 waveforms of enjoyable music (7!) discarding major,minor,flat,sharp variants.
1223.7 Analogous to Music Synthesis earlier, Merit of Academic Publications (Bibliometrics) concerns analysis and originality of Theorems and results proved thereof based on the fact that every theorem could be visualized as a graph of logical implications amongst pairs of logical statements (premise to QED) known as Girard Geometry of Interaction-ProofNets (Long Trip operator criterion) formalisms. If every theorem is constrained by maximum number of logical statements it can contain, number of all possible theorems that can ever be proved is upperbounded and finite (upholding Erdos' Straight from the book). On the contrary, there need not be any logical implication relation (but dependence of a note on previous notes can't be ruled out per se) between any two successive music notes in waveform unlike ProofNet GoIs of Theorems (or) Theorem is a music waveform of logical statements fortified by logical implications. All possible music melody waveforms have been already created (1223.14) and out in the open forcing the notion of "Creativity" in Music to be redefined as "Music search or Music discovery" as against "Music synthesis" - genius might have to be measured by ability to search from the catalogue of all possible music (68 billion of them for 12-note scale) than inventing afresh. More rigorous formulation of Music discovery could be the vector embedding of 68 billion melodies on an m-dimensional space of 12-note scale similar to alphabet-syllable vectorspace embedding of texts (each of the 12 notes are the alphabets for music waveform string) and performing Geometric search within it quite on the lines of Word2Vec embedding of texts. Music waveforms based on 7-note heptatonic octave scale (CDEFGABC) thus constitute a subspace of 12-note melody space of 68 billion waveforms (finer subdivisions of notes do a kernel lifting of the music from 7-note to 12-note shell space). English texts are embedded in an m-dimensional space of size (26)^m for maximum length m string - 68 billion 12-note melodies are likewise embedded in an m dimensional space of size (12)^m for maximum m length music notes waveform. Most albums are in the range of 5 minutes thereby upperbounding m to ~300 for 1 note per second - 7-note melodies are 7^m in number forming a subset of 12-note melodies.
1223.8 Unique identification of a digital artefact (music or art) by Non Fungible Tokens (NFT) assigned on a Cryptocurrency global hyperledger presents a new avenue for dispute-free unique identification adding to conventional face recognition,fingerprint recognition,fullbody recognition,handwriting recognition,gender recognition because non-fungibility implies non-exchangeability of an entity by a duplicate thereby ruling out forgery - watercolor art testlogs/ExamplePortrait1.jpg analyzed in NeuronRain face recognition could be a Non-Fungible Token on KingCobra Neuro HyperLedger, for example, preferably maintained on a Global Reference Count framework (Berkeley Ray).

They are the words of two lawyers who claim to have created an algorithm that can create, and allegedly has created, every single 12-note melody that has been written or indeed can ever be written. The creation of this algorithm is premised on the assumption that there is a finite number of melodies that can exist — the lawyers talk of the fact that songwriters are “walking on a melodic minefield”.  So how many melodies are there? It’s 68 billion, and they’re apparently all available on allthemusic.info. But the two lawyers are not claiming any ownership, rather they’re releasing the entire catalogue in the hope that it will put an end to all music copyright lawsuits..."

The first step towards this representation is to convert all the sequent calculus system, using the involutivity of negation, into a one-sided system, where sequents are of the form ⊢Γ...the first correctness criterion for MLL proof nets, called the “long trip criterion”, and present in Girard’s original paper, is exponential, as well as the ACC (Acyclic connected) criterion of Danos and Regnier..."

1225.1 GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.py has been updated to compute Voronoi tessellation facegraph,Delaunay triangulation,convex hull,contour segments and minimum enclosing circles of SEDAC Urban Expansion Probabilities Projection for Year 2030 (Southern India) - SEDAC2030UrbanExpansionProbabilities.jpg - which is a cellular automaton square grid raster of urban extent expansion probabilities in year 2030 proportionately coded by color legend. 
1225.2 Color legend is of size 100 for SEDAC Urban Expansion 2030 GIS and ranges from light to dark corresponding to 0% to 100% probabilities of urban expansion. For this reason, default grading legend averageBGR/255 * 100000 (e.g Barcelona in section 1211) has been used to compute population density.
1225.3 As mentioned in Section 1177, Urban Sprawl Expansion is the dynamic graph growing problem of adding new faces (or composing ears to create new faces) to Urban sprawl facegraph perimeter,a graph theoretic version of preferential attachment. Voronoi-Delaunay Facegraph of SEDAC Urban Expansion Probabilities Projection for Year 2030 computed earlier is a random graph wherein each ear or face is added to the periphery of an urban sprawl with probability assigned by color legend of the grid. Conventional Dynamic Graphs allow dynamic add-delete of vertices and edges while Urban Sprawl Expansion by face-ear composition along the circumference is an one-way Dynamic Graph and irreversible - only addition of edges and vertices are allowed and face of a suburb and its vertices-edges can't be deleted from an expanded urban sprawl.
1225.4 Most Urban area expansions in South India example previously have been colored in the probability range of 50% (plus or minus) and a projected emergence of megalopolises in 2030 is conspicuous in coastal urban areas of TN (tremendous westward and southward expansion of Chennai Metropolitan Sprawl upto Vellore-Puducherry and gradual coalescence of Puducherry urban sprawl-Cauvery river delta urban sprawl which could be another pearl river delta in the making) and entire west coast of Kerala. 
1225.5 In terms of realestate, Light shaded colors might indicate a horizontal residential growth while dark shaded regions might witness a vertical growth of skyscrapers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
1226.1 GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.py has been refactored to simplify population density computation clauses - with legend and without legend (or if color coding legend range is huge, proportionate scaling of population density by pixel color is inevitable) - by removing hardcoded values for maximum population density (~100000) and urban sprawl to population ratio heuristic (~6.22) and replacing them by function arguments to urban_sprawl_from_segments() - maximum_population_density and sqkmareatopopulationratio
1226.2 NASA SEDAC 2030 Urban Sprawl Expansion GIS projection in previous section has been reanalyzed for a fictitious maximum population density of 100000 and urban sprawl to population ratio heuristic of 6.22. There are no changes to contour-segment-convex hull visuals - logs of recomputed population estimates are at python-src/image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/testlogs/GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.log.15March2022.
1226.3 NeuronRain UGM (Urban Growth Model) is based on One Way Dynamic Graph upward growth of an Urban Sprawl FaceGraph by attaching faces (or composing ears as countermagnets) along its circumference, a generalization of widely used Cellular Automaton square grid expansion models (SLEUTH) to arbitrary shape cells - Cellular automata UGMs expand by adding square faces to periphery of an urban sprawl CA grid while NeuronRain Dynamic FaceGraph Urban Growth Model expands by annexing faces of arbitrary shapes to periphery of urban extent. 
1226.4 High Population Density faces along the boundaries and interiors of an urban sprawl FaceGraph are most likely to expand in future to adjoining and new peripheral faces. Parallel Algorithm for Cellular Automaton Fluid Dynamics in 135 is of uncanny similarity to CA Urban Growth Models - Fluid dynamics is replaced by Population dynamics - how population from high density cells (square faces) migrate towards low density cells (square faces) in parallel (either at random or influenced by UGM factors of 1226.8) is a generic CA abstraction underlying most of the parallel natural random processes including a fluid spreading from elevation to lowlying finally levelling the field. One of the most obvious factors influencing urban growth and expansion is Road gravity (or Transportation network gravity for multimodal transit) which is the real urban sprawl equivalent of intrinsic fitness of a social profile vertex (degree charisma of a social profile) in virtual online social networks - ability of a metropolitan agglomeration in attracting population settlements aligned to transportation network. 
1226.5 Cellular Automaton Urban Growth Models are exactly instances of CAGraph model of Pandemics/Memes/Opinions/Fads/Cybercrimes in Social and Electronic networks - each face of CAGraph is a square.
1226.6 Cellular Automata Grid of Square cells of an urban sprawl is a minimum bounding box rectangle of area (in contrast to minimum enclosing circle of an urban sprawl) equal to urban sprawl contour area extent sides of which are found by factorization (integer or real). While a real factorization of urban area into sides of a square is trivial by square root algorithm, integer factorization of an urban contour area into sides of an almost-square is non-trivial (a semiprime factorization of almost equal factor pairs). E.g factorization of an area 105 as 105=15*7 is less rectangular than 105=3*35 as ratio of the factors is closer to 1 in the former. Following algorithm finds an almost-square factorization of an integer:
	1226.6.1 Find square root (real) of an integer N by Newton-Raphson algorithm rounded off to nearest integer
	1226.6.2 Compute Planar factor point location around the vicinity of sqrt(N) by binary search-interpolation search on rasterized hyperbolic arc pixel array polygon segments - Number theoretic ray shooting query approximate factor estimates implemented in NeuronRain could further narrow down the search range and the factor point N=pq - (p,q) - closest to square root is of factor ratio (p/q) nearest to 1 which is the required bounding almost-square rectangle. Set partition to (Lagrange Sum of 4 squares) square tile cover reduction by an almost-square rectangle of sides obtained from Almost-square factorization algorithm earlier is the best possible square tile packing of an almost-square. 
1226.7 Minimum enclosing circle of an urban area is trivially a variant of real square root algorithm - urban sprawl is enclosed in a circle of radius = sqrt(contour_area / 3.1428).
1226.8 Transportation network gravity factor of Urban Growth Model is inversely proportional to areas of faces in transportation graph (each face is bounded by multimodal transit intersections):- Population settlements naturally gravitate and align to boundaries of face quadrilaterals of multimodal transportation network graph and as area of faces in transportation graph increase, distances between arterial multimodal transport intersection edges of faces widen discouraging settlements within the central regions of faces (low diffusion factor). Four colored urban sprawl facegraph of a metropolis could be approximated by faces of urban sprawl multimodal transportation graph. On the other hand, urban growth is often proportional to extent of vertical settlements (number of highrises), a variant of slope factor, often caused by horizontal space crunch.

Five factors control the behavior of the system. These are: a diffusion factor, which determines the overall outward dispersiveness of the distribution; a breed coefficient, which specifies how likely a newly generated detached settlement is to begin its own growth cycle; a spread coefficient, which controls how much organic expansion occurs from existing settlements, a slope resistance factor, which influences the likelihood of settlement extending up steeper slopes; and a road gravity factor which attracts new settlements toward and along roads. These values, which affect the acceptance level of randomly drawn numbers, are set by the user for every model run.  Four types of growth are defined in the model: spontaneous, diffusive, organic, and road influenced growth. Spontaneous growth occurs when a randomly chosen cell falls nearby an already urbanized cell, simulating the influence urban areas have on their surroundings. Diffusive growth permits the urbanization of cells which are flat enough to be desirable locations for development, even if they do not lie near an already established urban area. Organic growth spreads outward from existing urban centers, representing the tendency of cities to expand. Road influenced growth encourages urbanized cells to develop along the transportation network replicating increased accessibility ... "

sides of a rectangle (making it closest to 1) in Set Partition to Lagrange Sum of 4 Square Theorem square tile cover of a rectangle by Computational Geometric Integer Factorization
1227.2 Sides of almost-square rectangle are found assuming zero-knowledge of real square root by following algorithm:
	1227.2.1 List of all factors of an integral area found by Computational Geometric Binary Search Planar Point location Factorization are sorted and split into two equal halves
	1227.2.2 Approximate square root integer factor pairs are located on either side of factors-list midpoint - (*) first element of second half (*) last element of the first half. 
	1227.2.3 Earlier factors array midpoint heuristic obviates real square root computation,rounding it off and searching the vicinity of rounded-off real square root in finding almost-square factor pairs, which in essence is a zero-knowledge integer approximation of real square root - approximate square root could be found by solving Pell diophantine form of factorization as:
	(approximate_square_root + x)*(approximate_square_root - x) = 25 * 9 = 225
	approximate_square_root*2 = 34
	approximate_square_root = 17
	x*2 = 16
	x = 8 
	(or) (17 + 8)(17 - 8) = 25*9 = 225

1228.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1228.1 Nested Shells of Category of Topological Spaces (TOP) could be schematically visualized as a tree of shell topological spaces (binary tree or k-dimensional trees depending on how many subshells are nested within a supershell).
1228.2 An earlier formulation of nested topological spaces in 624 was based on Partial Order Semi Lattice dimensional hierarchy of Shell Turing Machines having Least Upper Bound dimensional Shell defined on Topological spaces (e.g Hilbert Space Turing Machines,Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space of computable functions). As a partial order does not guarantee a shell space to be a unique subspace of a superspace, a simplified tree nesting alternative of shell TOP spaces and kernel lift random walk in its interior is herein discussed. 
1228.3 Turing Degree is a measure of unsolvability of a set or an equivalence class of Turing Machines solving sets of similar hardness. Turing Jump of a Turing Machine X is the set of Turing Machines X' having oracle access to X or X' is the set of problems harder than X solvable by oracle access to X.
1228.4 Turing Degree of Shell Turing Machines increases from leaves to root in Tree model of Nested Shell Turing Machines - computational power of shell Turing Machines and hardness of set they solve evolve gradually from leaves to root as a result of higher visibility of logical truths available in TOP space vertices bottom-to-top. Random Kernel lifting (upwards and downwards) of logical truths within lower dimensional shells to-and-from higher dimensional shells (and viceversa) close to root is a graph random walk traversal of Tree of TOP Shell spaces. Root shell is omniscient and there is nothing to lift upwards beyond root. 
1228.5 Every interior vertex of Shell TOP space tree defines a space of logical statements embedded on vectorspace of some dimension and Turing Jump is indirectly defined by considering the lower dimensional TOP space children C(X) of an interior shell TOP space vertex X as oracles (or) X has oracle access to C(X) by Conduit Morphism Turing Machines which internally export-import logical statements between spaces of X and C(X).
1228.6 Arbitrarily traversing the tree of Shell TOP categories from leaves to root by kernel lift (upwards and downwards) of logical statements between pair of subshell and supershell vertices could be a random walk on the tree of TOP spaces. Estimating expected time to reach root shell from a leaf shell by kernel lifting is non-trivial and such a random walk could be exponential - O(k^n) for n-level nesting and k-dimensional tree. 
1228.7 Earlier Random walk traversal within a TOP Category of Topological spaces could be exemplified by a hypothetical UNIX Shell Tree Game below:
	1228.7.1 Intialize Root Shell
	1228.7.2 while (number of iterations < maximum)
		 {
			(*) Randomly create k subshells in parallel within each existing shell
			(*) Within each shell define some environment variables visible only within that shell (simulates logical truths known only within the shell space)
		 }
	1228.7.3 while (number of iterations < maximum)
		 { 
			(*) Turing Jump: Randomly EXPORT-IMPORT environment variables (kernel lifting random walk of logical statements 
			across spaces) to-and-from pairs of supershells and subshells (Most unix implementations support only EXPORT of 
			variables) within the TOP Shell space tree created in 1228.7.2. Direction of kernel lift (up or down) at each 
			shell space vertex is decided by pseudorandom coin toss (EXPORT or IMPORT) - this process draws a random walk

1228.8 Previous Shell Game terminates when all kernel lift (EXPORT-IMPORT) random walks reach root UNIX shell from leaf UNIX shells and truth values of all logical statements (environment variables) are visible within entire tree (In 1228.7.2 visibility of logical truths was restricted to individual shell TOP space vertices). It is obvious that there are random walks which may not end in root shell (because of perpetually oscillating kernel up-down lifts with in Shell TOP tree) causing the Turing machine computing the Shell Game to loop forever - Shell Game is undecidable and recursively enumerable.
1228.9 Kernel lifting in NeuronRain Theory Drafts are mostly devoted to 1-dimensional to 2-dimensional lift by Lagrange Four Square Theorem and 1-dimensional to k-dimensional lift by Chinese Remaindering Theorem (by a ring isomorphism between a ring of integer X mod N=n1*n2*...nk and direct product space of coprime integer rings X mod n1,X mod n2,...,X mod nk):
	Z/NZ <=> Z/n1Z * Z/n2Z * .... * Z/nkZ
1228.10 By MRDP Theorem Every Recursively Enumerable Set is Diophantine and earlier shell Turing Machine tree of TOP spaces defined by Turing Jump could be mapped to a corresponding tree of diophantines for the respective shell Turing Machine vertices.

1233.1 This commit implements Trimesh and Quadmesh generation from a facial image by loading GEO file for an image in GMSH FLTK GUI and GMSH Python API. 
1233.2 GMSH GEO has a separate scripting convention and an example CG GMSH GEO script from https://people.montefiore.uliege.be/geuzaine/ for mesh generation by different algorithms (Delaunay Trimesh and Quadmesh) has been suitably changed (TriMeshToQuadMesh.geo) to load a watercolor art by author (a Lenna Digital Image Processing lookalike - http://www.lenna.org/ - testlogs/ExamplePortrait2.jpg - dt.1990). TriMeshToQuadMesh.geo has to be opened in GMSH FLTK GUI (commandline: gmsh TriMeshToQuadMesh.geo 2>&1 > testlogs/gmsh.TriMeshToQuadMesh.geo.log.11April2022) and executed by selecting options for trimesh generation (saved to TriMeshToQuadMesh.msh) and recombination algorithm for converting trimesh to quadmesh (example logs: testlogs/gmsh.TriMeshToQuadMesh.geo.log.11April2022) which is written to testlogs/ExamplePortrait2_mesh.jpg.

1233.5 Quadmesh obtained earlier from GMSH might have to be a Graph object (and instantiation of Graph from Mesh is not obvious in GMSH which might have to be inferred from getNodes() and getElements() API) so as to compute isomorphisms,maximum common subgraphs and approximate topological matching between mesh(s) of faces and physiques. Physique Recognition could also be realized by Dynamic Time Warping analysis of Stream of Quadmesh(s) computed from frames of a video (CCTV footages).

1234.1 This update defines a new function polya_urn_urban_growth_model() in GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.py for implementing Polya Urn Urban Growth Model algorithm mentioned in 1226.17 (4-colored contour segmented Urban Sprawl FaceGraph segments as balls),as an alternative to Oneway Dynamic Facegraph growth outwards along perimeter of Urban sprawls (ear composition of new faces on circumeference). Polya Urn model is conceptually equivalent to cellular automata growth models but different in how population (segments) evolution growth rules are stipulated.
1234.2 Function polya_urn_urban_growth_model() populates a defaultdict map of 4 keys-to-buckets by randomly choosing one of the 4 color bucket indices and appends a segment from watershed contour segments of an Urban sprawl GIS to respective colored bucket. Another loop iteratively churns out random color indices of buckets and random indices of bucket elements to choose a random segment which is replicated and appended to bucket of same color. 
1234.3 Polya Urn has been implemented on a defaultdict(list) which is a separate chained hashtable, a drastic departure from conventional homogeneous blackbox urn having multicolored balls from which a colored ball is sampled and replaced with duplication. 
1234.4 Though Polya Urn model has been presently restricted to Urban Growth Models, its usage has far reaching implications cutting across any heterogeneous dataset e.g Survival Index WCET OS Scheduler described in NeuronRain Design is a Dynamic Polya Urn of processes colored by their clockticks and a randomly sampled processid from scheduler hashtable could be replaced by replication (or a new process replacement by fork()). 
1234.5 Contour segments of urban sprawls for NASA SEDAC Urban Expansion Probabilites 2030 GIS imagery have been encoded numerically prefixed by "s" and populated in Polya Urn defaultdict(list) separate chaining hashtable (printed to testlogs/GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.log.15April2022).
1234.6 Polya Urn Growth of Urban sprawl segments simulates rich-get-richer paradigm in Urban sprawl preferential attachment wherein an already grown settlement is overloaded by transportation network gravity factor. Dynamic Facegraph Urban Growth Model and Polya Urn Urban Growth Model for Urban Sprawls could be merged into one UGM by attaching every replicated clone of a sampled segment (encoded by one of the 4 colors) to the periphery of Urban sprawl facegraphs than interiors (which is anyway impossible in 2-dimensions unless UGM is extended to 3-dimensions for both horizontal and vertical (skyscrapers) expansions). 3D UGM including Vertical expansion (average number of skyscrapers of n storeys) is quite crucial in estimating prosperity (GDP) of an urban sprawl:
	Average number of skyscrapers above n-storeys in an urban sprawl = function_of(Opportunities/Horizontal_Area_Of_Urban_Sprawl)
which in other words could be stated as:  
	Vertical expansion of urban sprawl is directly proportional to growth in Opportunities(Jobs,Industries,Electricity consumption estimated from VIIRS-NightLights) and inversely proportional to horizontal area induced by geographic limitations in horizontal expansion.

1236.1 Application of Machine Learning to archaeology has been recently demonstrated by DeepMind Ithaca which restored 2500 year old Greek
manuscript by predicting illegible words damaged and lost in antiquity with high accuracy. 
1236.2 On similar lines, devising algorithms for deciphering ancient inscriptions (e.g. Voynich Manuscript, Scripts of Sarasvati-Indus Civilization) by artificial intelligence could be challenging open area of research. For example, Rebus principle which is the technique of code switching between scripts and pictures to express information, has been in vogue since time immemorial (example: word "height" is encoded by pictogram "h8" = "h" + "eight") - Cuneiform tablets, Hieroglyphs and ancient writing systems are pictograms of words and pictures to convey a coded message. Dreams have been interpreted by Rebus principle in Freudian psychology. Most undeciphered scripts contain a mixture of pictorial and script motifs (e.g Indus scripts) and a training data based machine learning algorithm might be less successful (as there are no prior unknown-to-known to train) compared to a rebus principle software implementation which sifts through the pictograms, performs a matching image search of the motifs and maps to a meaningful natural language text. Product Homotopy based Topological handwriting recognition mentioned earlier in section 714 could be extended to Rebus Topological script recognition for decipherment of newly excavated inscriptions by an approximate topological match with already excavated scripts:
	1236.2.1 Archaeology software implementing Rebus would hypothetically segment an image containing pictogram inscription yet to be deciphered, extract DP polynomials of contours in pictogram and find approximate topological match between known scripts and image motifs by Product homotopy-Pasting lemma pattern grammar which has already been implemented minimally in NeuronRain topological handwriting recognition (Directed Hausdorff distance between contours - clustering of close-enough contours of images-motifs-writings-scripts by Hausdorff distance defines a Product Homotopy) 
	1236.2.2 Additionally Rebus Topological Script Recognition would involve searching DP polynomials of script and image motif contours in a pre-defined database of deciphered image and script contours by various topological distance measures - it has to be pointed out that this database is not a training data but an expensive search space. For scripts differing by small deviations (Tamil Brahmi scripts in Keezhadi excavations differ only slightly from Indus Brahmi scripts - 1236.21) Dynamic Time Warping topological similarity could be useful considering segmented inscription-script images as timeseries waveforms or trimesh-quadmesh.
	1236.2.3 Logo-syllabic scripts (logo or motif per syllable) are mostly Rebus decipherable. Thus indirectly Rebus Topological Script Recognition for archaeological decipherment is already implemented in NeuronRain. 
1236.3 In this commit, a GIS image of Palk Straits and Adam's Bridge captured by NASA MODIS instrument in 2018 (250 metre resolution - NASA_MODIS_RamSethu_Image07272018_250m.jpg), which is legendarily attributed to Lord Rama, has been photoshopped and filtered by GIMP and contour segmented. An earlier image of Adam's Bridge by NASA in 2007 was subject matter of debate.
1236.4 Adam's Bridge or Ramsethu is perhaps the only available prima facie archaeological evidence for establishing historicity of Ramayana. Differentiating man-made structures from natural terrains has long been investigated by large scale visual algorithms mostly in the context of  Drone urban extent imagery analyzers for classification of settlements (1182.6). 
1236.5 Proving if aforementioned MODIS image of Adam's Bridge is natural or manmade might require a sophisticated Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) Remote Sensing going beyond aerial imagery for analysis of ocean floor and depth - scripture mentions the bridge has been built by woods and elephant-sized sandstones dragged by mechanised contrivances and only a GPR imagery might help in verifying if ocean floor has fossil remnants of wooden structures though studies have revealed heavy presence of sandstones. To compensate for lack of GPR original MODIS image has been enhanced by VFX filters (sharpening,anti-aliasing,contrast) to make graded depth of ocean more pronounced.
1236.6 Another curious aspect of Adam's Bridge is its curvature possibly caused by ocean currents, as a bridge is usually a straightline and scripture verses mention that monkey-men used ropes to ensure straightline alignment of the bridge.
1236.7 Contour segmented image NASA_MODIS_RamSethu_Image07272018_250m_contoursegmented_20April2022.jpg has been color coded and colors might mostly be proportional to their depth (or elevation). Particularly the streak of shoals bridging international waters has been uniformly colored in blue. This is probably because of OpenCV implementations of Watershed algorithm for segmentation by pixel color depth and Teh-Chin Chain Approximation algorithm for contour detection which is based on dominant points detection (high curvature points).

Several geological features such as deep river cut valleys of the Cauvery river system and submarine canyons were interpreted on the sea floor. They indicate that the Poompuhar region was prone to floods, tsunamis and accelerated impact of sea level rise and cyclone-induced surges. The port city had probably been relocated and rebuilt repeatedly owing to such natural occurrences. The seventh redevelopment was probably about 2,500 years ago and it might have submerged due to rise in sea level about 1,020 years ago....A major finding, based on a study of the past sea levels, is that Poompuhar is not just 2,500 years old as believed widely and might be more than 15,000 years old. It might be one of the oldest port cities in the world..." - Proximity to Ramsethu structure and purported date of Ramsethu (1236.27) is of importance.

(THEORY and FEATURE) Merit of Large Scale Visuals - Face recognition by Approximate Topological Match of GMSH Quadmesh images - 25,26 April 2022 - related to 1203,1232,1233,1236 and all sections on Merit of Large Scale Visuals, Physique Recognition From Quadrilateral mesh isomorphism,Topological Face and Handwriting recognition, Archaeology-Topological Script Recognition, Product Homotopy, Unique identification, Homeomorphism and Topological Deformations, Merit of Large Scale Visuals, People Analytics, Computational Geometry, Graph Edit Distance and Earth mover distance, Graph Isomorphism (Exact, Approximate and Subgraph),Graph matching,Graph similarity,Image Search,Quadrilateral Mesh Deformation and Isomorphism,Maximum Common Subgraph Problem and Approximate Topological Matching,Astronomical Datasets
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1237.1 In this commit, an approximate topological match between two contour segmented GMSH quadmesh images of portraits - python-src/testlogs/ExamplePortrait1.jpg and python-src/image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/testlogs/ExamplePortrait2.jpg - has been computed by directed Hausdorff distance between set of DP polynomials of the two image contours.
1237.2 python-src/image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/TriMeshToQuadMesh.geo has been updated to write trimesh MSH file (TriMeshToQuadMesh.msh) for python-src/testlogs/ExamplePortrait1.jpg by loading GEO file in GMSH FLTK GUI and option "save Mesh" - Mesh file TriMeshToQuadMesh.msh has been overwritten.
1237.3 TriMesh earlier is recombined to QuadMesh by python 3.7 script TriMeshToQuadMesh.py through commandline - python3.7 TriMeshToQuadMesh.py 2>&1 > testlogs/python3.7.TriMeshToQuadMesh.log.25April2022 - and QuadMesh for ExamplePortrait1.jpg is written to ExamplePortrait1_mesh.jpg by Blossom-FullQuad Recombination algorithm (an FLTK GUI radio button option). Network HTML plot of Delaunay Trimesh has been made optional by boolean flag bezier_animation set as False by default in DeepLearning_ConvolutionNetwork_BackPropagation.py face recognition routine.
1237.4 QuadMesh for ExamplePortrait2.jpg is already present in ExamplePortrait2_mesh.jpg (created by 1233 earlier) which was obtained by Blossom Recombination.
1237.5 DeepLearning_ConvolutionNetwork_BackPropagation.py has been updated to add additional parameters approximate_topological_match=True and match_fraction=0.000001 to facegraph_similarity_metrics() which is read within a new clause to compute approximate DP polynomials for some fraction of contours (set to 0.000001 by default because full image Hausdorff match - match_fraction=1.0 - is computationally intensive as number of contours for all quadfaces is in order of thousands or almost equal to pixel area of the image as each quadface is a rectangular aggregate of few pixel squares) for quadfaces in two quadmeshes and find an approximate topological match by directed Hausdorff distance between sets of contours belonging to two portraits. Graph Isomorphism computation is excluded by this option and clause returns after topological match computation.
1237.6 Getting a Graph object from QuadMesh (mentioned in 1233.5) has been obviated by contour polynomials computation for every quadmesh face which indirectly encode the topology of the face. Contour segmented images of the two quadmesh(s) for ExamplePortrait1.jpg and ExamplePortrait2.jpg -  python-src/image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/testlogs/ExamplePortrait2_mesh_contoursegmented_25April2022.jpg and python-src/testlogs/ExamplePortrait1_mesh_contoursegmented_25April2022.jpg - reveal how contours closely align with each quadrilateral face thereby achieving a superlative objective of not just extracting graph structure of the mesh but also preserving topological orientation of each quadrilateral algebraically.
1237.7 DP Contour polynomials for every quadrilateral face of a quadmesh found earlier is a basic prerequisite for any approximate topological matching algorithm including Hausdorff distance. For example, approximate topological matching of oriented quadfaces in 1203.6 could be augmented by maximum per quadface common contour DP polynomial match which is a further finetuning of maximum common subgraph matching problem. Matching quadfaces could be determined by inner product space polynomial distances between DP polynomials of the quadfaces - quadfaces of small distances are approximate topological matches and similarity is the percentage of matching quadface contours.
1237.8 Earlier DP polynomial distance measure could be suitably adapted to Rebus Topological Script Recognition in archaeological decipherment by exhaustively searching for least distance approximate topological contour match for an undeciphered script quadmesh image, in pre-defined database of pictogram motif quadmesh contour DP polynomials and concatenate textual description for the motifs into a meaningful sentence - Example: Dholavira signboard in 1236.20 might be Rebus deciphered by a hypothetical contour search-match algorithm as "Wheel-Hammer-Wheel-Pounding Urn-Wheel-Wheel-Sickle" (Indus script for a civilization ranging from time duration of 7000BC - Mehrgarh - is presumed to be right-to-left and logo-syllabic) based on an ImageNet ResNet50 prediction search of the motifs of least contour DP polynomial distance which could be contextually inferred as a natural language sentence "Transport of Processed (Agriculture) Products" after ImageNet prediction Textgraph thesaurus expansion for Wheel(Transport),Hammer,Urn and Sickle(Processing tools mostly used in cultivation) neglecting the repetitive logos and their order.
1237.9 Disclaimer: Earlier Dholavira signboard example is not a decipherment claim but stated herein as only a walkthrough on how an AI Topological script recognition-decipherment algorithm might approximate the meaning of an undeciphered archaological inscription. By Rebus principle, meaning of a pictogram inscription could be inferred independent of natural language underneath and knowledge of syllables for each logo may not be necessary - even if it does, ResNet50 prediction in English for an image motif might have to be translated to corresponding word-syllables of all possible contemporary-medieval languages and a sentence might have to be formed from their concatenation right-to-left or left-to-right to zero-in-on the origin of ancient script - an exponentially daunting computational effort. In the example 1236.2, pictogram "h8" could as well be deciphered though an AI algorithm which searches ResNet50 and concatenates syllable-word predictions for "h" and symbol "8" in any other language and only h+eight=height in English is meaningful. ImageNet-ResNet50 is a standard massive deep learning dataset for supercomputers.
1237.10 A paradoxical implication arises if similarities between Keezhadi Script and Indus Script turn out to be derivatives of one another and are classified into one of contemporary languages (Sanskrit as per decipherment claim 1236.11 or Tamil) by an exhaustive Rebus AI contour polynomial-word-syllable search (which is evident from cursory visual glance): Both Indus and Keezhadi scripts should belong to Tamil or else both should be Sanskrit unless a common unifying script was used in the past by both prima facie hinting at common ancestry of Tamil and Sanskrit (as per a legend, Tamil grammar propounded by Agastya is a simplified form of Panini's Sanskrit grammar with Ka-Cha-Ta-Pa-Yadi vargas removed).
1237.11 Decipherment of archaeological motifs is often inseparable from astronomy and recorded history of eclipses in cuneiforms,copper plates,rock edicts and scripture manuscripts is sizeable requiring dating of the inscriptions by C-14 or AMS (Accelerated Mass Spectrometry) and exhaustive search of astronomical data for planetary alignment in an ephemeris software dating back to few thousand years which is hindered by calendar conflicts(Julian-Gregorian-Sidereal-Solar-Lunar),Software overflow errors,Use of Tropical (Dynamic based on Sun's motion over equinoctical points) and Sidereal (Static) zodiacs. Axiomatically it can be stated,hence,that an accurate estimate of civilization timeline must satisfy all 3 predictions(or post-dictions): Script Decipherment, Astronomy and Carbon dating-AMS must concur. NeuronRain implements a textual astronomical dataset pattern mining (Maitreya' Dreams NASA JPL Ephemeris CLI) for extreme weather events by encoding celestial bodies as strings (GSP Sequence Mining, Longest Common Subsequence , BioPython-ClustalOmega Multiple Sequence Alignment analytics of strings) which could be complemented by large scale visual analytics of a planetarium software sky imagery (https://stellarium.org/) of constellations and planets (Image similarity found through various algorithms - Voronoi tessellation,quadmesh,histogram,dynamic time warping - between skyview imagery in two different time points of extreme weather events).

(THEORY and FEATURE) Merit of Large Scale Visuals - ImageNet predictions from multiple models - Rebus Topological Script Recognition - Dholavira Signboard example deciphered by ResNet50 and ResNet50V2 - 28 April 2022 - relateed to 1236,1237 and all sections on Archaeology-Topological Script Recognition, Face-Physique-Handwriting-Gender-Motif Recognition, Product Homotopy, Unique identification, Homeomorphism and Topological Deformations, Merit of Large Scale Visuals

1238.1 ImageGraph_Keras_Theano.py has been updated to refactor imagenet_imagegraph() for ImageNet predictions from multiple Deep Learning Models instead of hardcoded ResNet50 earlier.
1238.2 Models have been instantiated within a dictionary of modelname-model map and are iterated in a loop and ImageNet predictions for an image are sequentially printed. List of all available Keras Deep Learning models and their top-k accuracy are at https://keras.io/api/applications/
1238.3 Since Deep Learning models are efficient probabilistic guesses of artifacts in an image based on convolution network layers, top accuracy has been increased to 5 to allow top 5 probabilities.
1238.4 To verify the Rebus principle topological script recognition algorithm mentioned in 1236 and 1237, Dholavira signboard image from https://www.harappa.com/blog/dholavira-and-its-mysterious-sign-board (testlogs/The_Ten_Indus_Scripts_discovered_near_the_northern_gateway_of_the_Dholavira_citadel.jpg) containing 10 pictorial symbols of Indus script has been deciphered by ResNet50 and ResNet50V2 models in imagenet_imagegraph() and the results ensue (full logs: testlogs/ImageGraph_Keras_Theano.log.28April2022 for top-5 and ImageGraph_Keras_Theano.log2.28April2022 for top-1 accuracies).
1238.5 For ResNet50 predictions and their top-5 probabilities are:
('Predictions - ', 'ResNet50', ':', [[('n03857828', 'oscilloscope', 0.18934955), ('n03291819', 'envelope', 0.05882809), ('n02840245', 'binder', 0.029974239), ('n04554684', 'washer', 0.025299871), ('n03041632', 'cleaver', 0.024807546)]])
1238.6 For ResNet50V2 predictions and their top-5 probabilities are:
('Predictions - ', 'ResNet50V2', ':', [[('n02123597', 'Siamese_cat', 0.9940566), ('n02089973', 'English_foxhound', 0.0059434352), ('n07613480', 'trifle', 1.8534284e-13), ('n02356798', 'fox_squirrel', 4.2353065e-23), ('n04479046', 'trench_coat', 1.3498343e-29)]])
1238.7 Counterintuitively, ResNet50 version 1 is predicting better than ResNet50 version 2 for top-5 accuracy - Cleaver or a large knife, Washer or a wheel are reasonable matches for symbols in signboard excluding "oscilloscope"- though both are far away from expected decipherment by a hypothetical DP contour polynomial match algorithm mentioned earlier in 1237.8. Extending deep-learning models to train and match arbitrary topological varieties (contour polynomials of images instead of images - a mammoth computational task in itself to create such a contour database) by their polynomial distance similarity might improve decipherment accuracy. 
1238.8 Top pageranked vertices in Textgraph of ImageNet-ResNet50 predictions in 1238.5 are:

1238.9 For 2 inscriptions containing some common scripts-motifs, set intersection between textgraphs of their ImageNet predictions isolates the meaning of common scripts-motifs in 2 inscriptions which is the fundamental necessity for a Rebus decipherment breakthrough. Textgraph creation from ImageNet predictions are best suited for archaeological script decipherment as there are no intermediate phases of sentence formation and syllable demarcation and meaning is represented by textgraph directly which in itself is a decipherment. 
1238.10 Example: For the following two inscriptions having A,B and C as scripts-motifs (and common script B):
			A B - inscription1 and textgraph1 for its ImageNet predictions
			B C - inscription2 and textgraph2 for its ImageNet predictions
set intersection of textgraph1 and textgraph2 from ImageNet predictions of 2 inscriptions isolates the meaning of script B.

textually encoded astronomical datasets, Various algorithms for string analytics, climate analytics, weather analytics, N-Body problem,
Computational Astrophysics, Computational Geometry
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1239.1 NeuronRain has so far been confined to analytics of textual astronomical datasets correlated to terrestial extreme weather events, which are encoded strings of degree alignments (N-body choreography) of celestial bodies on zodiac obtained from an ephemeris client (NASA JPL ephemeris - Maitreya's Dreams Text Client).
1239.2 This commit extends astronomy analytics to sky imagery of celestial bodies sourced from Planetarium software. Astronomical imagery of celestial bodies are scatterplots of distant objects (constellations,planets,meteor showers are usually circles of varying radii spread out on sky) and visual clustering and segmentation algorithms viz., DBSCAN, Watershed segmentation, Chain approximation contour detection could be suited for classifying the point celestial objects into en-masse clusters. Each cluster thus found is a candidate for gravitational influence on earth's tectonics which in a sense generalizes 12 house static zodiac division over 360 degrees of 30 degrees each, to a sky arbitrarily divided by clustering and segmentation algorithms based on density of objects.
1239.3 Celestial objects for two high richter scale seismic events and two of the top 10 high deathtoll disasters ever - Tangshan earthquake of 26 July 1976 and Boxing Day Sumatra earthquake of 26 December 2004 (both coinciding with fullmoon or newmoon - fullmoon or newmoon is often cited as prerequisite for a seismic event possibly exacerbated by a solar or lunar eclipse) - have been plotted in The Sky Live planetarium as observed from respective epicentres and captured in two JPG files (includes both above horizon and below horizon bodies) - SkyLive_SumatraBoxingDayEarthQuake_26December2004_0758.jpg (7:58 am local time) and SkyLive_TangshanEarthQuake_28July1976_0342.jpg (3:42 am local time) 
1239.4 Image segmentation in ImageGraph_Keras_Theano.py has been changed to include Delaunay Triangulation and Voronoi Tessellation plots for an image imported from GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.py. Keras backend has been set to Theano. Return value tuple of image_segmentation() has been updated to return img ndarray and contourcentroids instead of GRANA centroids.
1239.5 Following computation has been performed on 2 seismic events sky imagery (logs,Voronoi and Delaunay imagery,DBSCAN clustering imagery, Neural network clustering imagery,DOT files of the facegraphs):

		number of DBSCAN density clusters: 104719
		size of image: 869031

1239.6 Of all the clustering data earlier, Watershed segmentation imagery has computed a remarkable visual demarcation of celestial clustering compared to DBSCAN clustering, Neural network clustering, Voronoi-Delaunay tessellation pivoted around Chain approximation contour centroids (which is too fine-grained mesh). Additionally what catches the attention is the unusually high number of meteor showers in Tangshan imagery though clustering is sparse (7.5 richter), while Sumatra imagery has noticeable clustering of bodies around Milky way and less meteor showers (9.1 richter).

1240.1 New function frequent_subgraphs_of_imagenet_prediction_textgraphs() has been defined to compute GSpan frequent subgraph mining of textgraphs deeplearnt from ImageNet predictions (ResNet50,ResNet50V2) by Recursive Gloss Overlap Dense subgraph classifier. Frequent subgraphs of ImageNet prediction textgraphs learnt from different inscriptions approximately correspond to common scripts-motifs in the inscriptions. Frequent subgraph mining generalizes set intersection of Rebus pictogram textgraphs mentioned in 1238.

1240.4 From earlier frequent subgraph mining, few notable common vertices between ImageNet textgraphs of 3 unicorn seals are: 
		ResNet50 - sundial, gnomon, fire, cup-shaped (perhaps hinting at an animal sacrifice fire altar and astronomical configuration during sacrifice guided by gnomon-sundial - script on seal might be a description of sacrifice) 
		ResNet50V2 - foxhound (unicorn bull or buffalo figurine has been predicted as foxhound)

In the form of worship at Kannapuram, a south India village in Tamil Nadu studied by Brenda Beck (1981), the tree-truck (known as kampam in Tamil, from Sanskrit skambha ("pillar") in front of which the sacrificial buffaloes are decapitated, is said to be the husband of the goddess. At the end of the annual marriage rite, after the last victim has been slaughtered, this trunk is uprooted and the goddess divested of her ornaments like a widow. The pillar and its uprooting correspond to Siva's phallus and its castration. The sacrificial post used to be burned after the divine marriage festival ... Later Parpola continues: "If the buffalo sacrifice is common in south Indian village religion, it is absent from north Indian village religion. The reason is probably the conscious efforts of Vedic Brahmans to eradicate it. Extravagant buffalo sacrifices were at first adopted by the Rigvedic Aryans in the Indus Valley (RV 5,29,7-8 etc.), but thereafter this mode of worship is not heard of."
1240.9 John Marshall's interpretation of Pashupati Seal as Lord Shiva - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashupati_seal - "...My reasons for the identification are four. In the first place the figure has three faces and that Siva was portrayed with three as well as with more usual five faces, there are abundant examples to prove. Secondly, the head is crowned with the horns of a bull and the trisula are characteristic emblems of Siva. Thirdly, the figure is in a typical yoga attitude, and Siva [sic] was and still is, regarded as a mahayogi—the prince of Yogis. Fourthly, he is surrounded by animals, and Siva is par excellence the "Lord of Animals" (Pasupati)—of the wild animals of the jungle, according to the Vedic meaning of the word pashu, no less than that of domesticated cattle..."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
1252.1 An algorithm for Automatic Delineation of Urban Growth Boundaries(UGB) from Minimum Spanning Tree of Building Coverage Ratio Segmentation (Meta Research - High Resolution Settlement Layer) and Voronoi-Delaunay Tessellation-Triangulation vis-a-vis Expert Delineation has been studied in 1226.19 - Algorithmic UGB Delineation has been found to be ~93% accurate at its maximum (Frankfurt-Main) versus manual expert delineation. 
1252.2 Extracting Road networks from GIS (a crucial prerequisite for predefined Unmanned Aerial Vehicle mission flight plans) preserving topological orientation is of paramount significance in delimiting rural-urban boundaries.
1252.3 Transport Networks are graph structures with added topological embedding defined on a 2D plane connecting urban centres (allowing twists and turns in each edge as against traditional straightline edges of Graph theory) and an optimal layout of transportation network is an unrestricted-twist-and-turn variant of wiring problem in logic gate arrays (optimal space efficient layout of wires connecting logic gates is reduced to optimal space efficient layout of transport network carriageways connecting urban centres) which is NP-Hard for maximum of one 90 degree turn. Problem of unrestricted 90 degree turns between two points approximating a carriageway could be significantly harder(a random walk on a grid). Usual graph algorithms discard layout topology. 
1252.4 Inferring a graph structure which preserves topology of transportation network edges from a Transit network GIS is non-trivial and similar to sections 1233,1237 (which warrant a Graph topology from Quadmesh that preserves face orientations),contour polynomials (which correspond to topological orientation of road-rail network) of transportation network are retrieved from segmentation of an example GIS image of Chennai Metropolitan Area (python-src/image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/testlogs/ChennaiMetropolitanAreaTransitNetwork_GoogleMaps_20May2022.jpg - Google Maps augmented by Transport network,Terrain,Live Traffic layers) bypassing necessity for access to Graph structure of Transportation network (e.g Google Roads REST API)
1252.5 Automatic Delineation of Chennai Metropolitan Area by NASA VIIRS NightTime Lights based Urban Extent Learner in earlier sections (1174)depends on luminosity of night lights which at times could be disproportionate to urban area and only a lowerbound of the sprawl. Earlier Google Maps GIS of Transportation network - python-src/image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/testlogs/ChennaiMetropolitanAreaTransitNetwork_GoogleMaps_20May2022.jpg - is a daylight image and vegetation-tree-canopies (NDVI) are conspicuous by green color pixels. Extent of vegetation is inversely proportional to urbanization and degree of transportation network is maximum in urban centres (as multiple carriageways originate from a thriving megapolis).
1252.6 Extent of Urbanization is proportional to dense subgraphs of transportation networks - In earlier GIS imagery, high concentration of transit network aligned to Chennai Metropolitan Area sprawl of approximately 100 kms radius (coinciding with suburban transport network) in North-South-West has been reflected in topological clustering of contour polynomials of transit network plotted in ChennaiMetropolitanAreaTransitNetwork_GoogleMaps_20May2022-contoursegmented.jpg. Extent of a Metropolitan Area Sprawl has been defined earlier (1151) as area catered by suburban transport network or floating population depending on urban centre.
1252.7 Partitioning of contour polynomials of transportation network edges into dense and sparse clusters is a delineator: (*) Dense contour polynomial clusters (subgraphs) of small face areas denote an urban sprawl (*) Sparse contour polynomial clusters (subgraphs) of high face areas might be rural. Voronoi Tessellation-Delaunay Triangulation of earlier image at ChennaiMetropolitanAreaTransitNetwork_GoogleMaps_20May2022-contourlabelled.jpg is too fine-grained and does not show transportation network clustering.
1252.8 Previous set of contour polynomials of transportation network could (*) either be an automatic delineator of Chennai Metropolitan Area Sprawl based on clusters of contour polynomials segregated by their Hausdorff topological distance or Inner product distance (*) or assist a manual expert delineation.

1253. (THEORY and FEATURE) Merit of Large Scale Visuals - GIS Urban Sprawl Analytics - Automatic Delineation of Urban Growth Boundaries from Transportation Network GIS 2 - KMeans Clustering of Contour Polynomials - 24 May 2022 - related to 714,1151,1174,1196,1226,1233,1234,1237,1252 and all sections on GIS Urban Sprawl Analytics, Merit of Large Scale Visuals, Gridded Population Estimators (SEDAC GPW4 and GHSL convex hull estimators), DBSCAN and Neural Network Urban Extent Learners, Computational Geometry, Intrinsic Merit Rankings, R Ricker Population Estimation, Community detection, Social Network Analytics, Space filling by Curves, Unequal Circle and Polynomial packing, Computational Geometry and Polygonal packing by Voronoi Tessellation, Four color theorem, Economic Merit, Computational Economics - GDP estimation from electricity consumption, Jordan Curve Theorem, Weirstrass Theorem, Cellular Automata-SLEUTH Urban Growth Models, Automatic Delineation of Urban Growth Boundaries, Preferential attachment,Random Graphs,Dynamic Graphs,Separate Chaining Hash tables, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Navigation-Autonomous Drone Delivery-Drone EVMs-Passenger Drones,Wiring Problem

1253.1 New clustering function contours_kmeans_clustering(imagefile,segment,number_of_clusters=3,maxiterations=3) has been defined in ImageGraph_Keras_Theano.py which implements K-Means Clustering of contour polynomials not only useful for automatic delineation of urban boundaries from GIS transportation network imagery but also in analysis of any contour segmented large scale visual.
1253.2 Function contours_kmeans_clustering() is a Python 3.7.x verbatim translation of C++ k-means unsupervised clustering implementation in NeuronRain AstroInfer (centroids of contour clusters are with reference to a predefined contour similar to cpp-src/asferkmeansclustering.cpp which computes centroids based on a reference string) and redefines the Euclidean distance metric as topological Hausdorff distance amongst pair of contour polynomials in place of string edit distance. 
1253.3 Pasting Lemma-Path Homotopy-Product Homotopy formalism for Shape Recognition (Inscription Decipherment-Handwriting-Face-Physique-Gender) in earlier sections (714) is a proper subset ("Very similar") of Contour Polynomial clustering ("Similar") of a visual focusing only on homeomorphic deformation of shapes - set of deformations are cluster subsets.
1253.4 Usual clustering algorithms are limited to delineation of point sets while contours are sets of polynomials (or algebraic varieties) defining a topological orientation. Clustering of polynomials or curves is less studied in Bigdata mining. This requires definition of Euclidean distance as topological or polynomial distance,revised from usual Levenshtein distance for texts. 
1253.5 Transportation Network Google Maps imagery of Chennai Metropolitan area testlogs/ChennaiMetropolitanAreaTransitNetwork_GoogleMaps_20May2022.jpg which includes Live traffic layer (red busy clrcles - a visual urbanization measure of dynamic floating population centred around a city) has been clustered by K-Means (3 clusters and 3 iterations) and contour polynomials of transportation network are colored in RGB channels proportional to the cluster id they have been classified into (written to ChennaiMetropolitanAreaTransitNetwork_GoogleMaps_20May2022-contourkmeansclustered.jpg).
1253.6 Voronoi Tessellation and Delaunay Triangulation have been made optional by boolean flags voronoi_delaunay=False in following segmentation functions in ImageGraph_Keras_Theano.py and GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.py as plots by multiple segmentation algorithms obfuscate and overlay previous layers:
	(*) def urban_sprawl_from_segments(image,segment,maximum_population_density=None,sqkmtocontourarearatio=0,legend=None,sqkmareatopopulationratio=6.22,voronoi_delaunay=False)
	(*) def image_segmentation(imagefile,voronoi_delaunay=False)
1253.7 Following are the contour segmented files created by this commit:
	(*) Voronoi-Delaunay set to False - testlogs/ChennaiMetropolitanAreaTransitNetwork_GoogleMaps_20May2022-contourlabelled.jpg
	(*) Plot for KMeans clustering of contour polynomials - testlogs/ChennaiMetropolitanAreaTransitNetwork_GoogleMaps_20May2022-contourkmeansclustered.jpg - 3 color coded clusters of transportation network contours
	(*) Contour polynomial cluster dictionary is printed to Logs (comprehensive listing of 3 clusters of contour polynomials computed from testlogs/ChennaiMetropolitanAreaTransitNetwork_GoogleMaps_20May2022.jpg which could be candidate delineators, better than graphics plot earlier as color differentiation for 3 clusters in drawContours is not upto mark) - testlogs/GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.log.24May2022 - road network polynomials (wires connecting localities) are discernible by their almost straightline alignment (pixel ordinates are almost same in one axis while the other axis increments) having some arbitrary degree turns.

Number of such optimal alignments equals Catalan number.

Number of least root mean square error monotone lattice walks could be (more than 1) equal to m! for m 90 degree turn points (m <= n) based on all possible permutations of distance-squares in Root Mean Square Error(RMSE)=sqrt(sum(pi-xi)^2) for pi=90 degree turn points on lattice walks and xi=points on straightline fit which are perpendicular projections from turn points. Probability of finding least RMSE monotone lattice walk=m!/Catalan_number and brute force algorithm enumerates all lattice walks,sorts them by RMSE between straightline fit and chooses top-ranked least RMSE lattice walks by probability earlier. Previous brute force algorithm is exponential - O(2^n) to O(3^n) depending on optimizations for n*n grid.

1255.1 MaitreyaEncHoro_RuleSearch.py python Swiss-JPL ephemeris search maitreya8t text client wrapper has been updated for searching sky for a zodiac configuration which simulates visual timeline search for celestial bodies in planetarium software.
1255.2 Astronomical data are rife in ancient scriptures and most archaeological artefacts as religion and astronomy are often intertwined. Scientific corroboration of mythology and historicity of epics requires an exhaustive search of astronomical references in scriptures either through Planetarium software or traditional alternatives.
1255.3 Problem lies in computational cost of this exhaustive search to pinpoint historic timeline of events described in an epic which could have occurred few millenia ago and lack of ephemeris data for that period (possibly hindered by tropical-sidereal conflicts,ayanamsa conundrum among others). Exhaustive search could be optimized to some extent by exploiting orbital periodicity-conjunctions of planets and extrapolating future - e.g Eight planets were conjunct 0 degree of Aries during Kali era birth, Eight planets were conjunct in 1962 in Aquarius. 
1255.4 Visual equivalent of earlier textual search script could be far more intensive and might need preprocessing but does not depend on cuspal boundaries :
	1255.4.1 Plot visual zodiac (Degrees of Planets,Meteors,Constellations) from astronomical data mentioned in a treatise  
	1255.4.2 Do a matching image search of previous plot and Visual Planetarium Sky Maps dating back thousands of years - number of sky images to search and match could be in millions. 
1255.5 MaitreyaEncHoro_RuleSearch.py has been so far restricted to search of class association rules (which are subsets of 360 degree zodiac), mined from past extreme weather event datasets by GSP Sequence Mining and Sequence Alignment, to predict future climate and seismic events. It has been enhanced in this commit to search a celestial configuration from text file CelestialConfiguration.txt (full 360 degree zodiac - which could be birth data of a mythological personality or event described in scriptures) in the ephemeris within a minimum-maximum range of days-months-years through maitreya8t text client. 
1255.6 MaitreyaEncHoro_RuleSearch.py has been upgraded to Python 3.7 by 2to3 + autopep8 upgrade tools. Two boolean flags ClassAssociationRuleSearch and PlanetariumSearch have been introduced to separate CAR (class association rule) search and Planetarium search (read from either MinedClassAssociationRules.txt or CelestialConfiguration.txt) and invoke either substring_find() or a new function match_chart_and_rule().
1255.7 New function match_chart_and_rule() has been implemented as a container iterable alternative of string-based substring_find() to check equality of chart data dictionary from maitreya8t and dictionary computed from CelestialConfiguration.txt and return boolean -1 (Dissimilar) or 1 (Similar).

1255.8 Maitreya8t and any planetarium software are limited by availability of ephemeris data which seems to be restricted to 3000 BC and older dates are not supported. Maitreya8t provides facilities for astrological matrimonial match by following commandline options:
	 --file2=<str>             	Open second file for partner chart
	 --partner-vedic           	Show Vedic partner analysis
  	 --partner-composite       	Show partner composite chart
which is culture-oriented orthodox match making complementing reciprocal recommender systems followed in bipartite (Bride-Groom) matrimonial portal software.

1257.1 Function medical_imageing() in ImageGraph_Keras_Theano.py has been updated to include a clause for fMRI imagery sourced from various experimental study datasets on sensory stimuli affecting human brain, especially how an audio-visual stimulus evokes autobiographical memories of the past. With this support for ECG,MRI and fMRI medical imagery analysis have been added in NeuronRain. 
1257.2 Distinguishing human enjoyable music from the rest is the cornerstone of fMRI research having far-reaching implications for music industry, music creativity or music search-music discovery if all 12-note music melody waveforms numbering 68 billion have been already found (from 1223.13). "Is the set of enjoyable music (majority voted, liked by lot) = quality music (naturally meritorious, not voted)" is another open problem in intrinsic merit of music and fits into the realm of Condorcet Jury Theorem variants for bounds on Correctness of Group Decision (Black-Ladha). 
1257.3 In this update, an fMRI image for music stimulus (UCDavis dataset imagery - testlogs/medical_imageing/fMRI_MusicStimulus_UCDavis_janata_brain_lg.jpg) on human subjects (music genre of enjoyable-familiar nature evoking memories) has been analyzed by image_segmentation() and its Chain approximation contours,Voronoi-Delaunay Tessellation-Triangulation,Facegraph,Watershed segments are computed as below:

1257.4 Evocation of Memories expressed as texts have been earlier studied and implemented in NeuronRain by various gadgets - ThoughtNet Hypergraph Evocation,Contextual Multi Armed Bandits,Reinforcement Learning and Evocation WordNet - while audio-visual evocation is the best possible formulation of ThoughtNet evocation wherein thoughts are audio-visualized and stored in ThoughtNet Hypergraph hyperedges and hypervertices (Example in Section 385). 
1257.5 If number of all possible music waveform melodies are upperbounded by 68 billion in 12-note scale, number of fMRI visuals of human brain for music sensory stimuli are upperbounded as well at 68 billion thereby narrowing down the size of fMRI dataset.

1259.4 New Apache Arrow memory manager in Spark 3.0.1 which replaces old Python Virtual Machine - Java Virtual Machine marshalling for Py4J from Spark 3.0.x has been enabled in spark-defaults.conf along with other timeouts and heartbeat timer interval values. But they still do not resolve connection reset exceptions for large integers (especially above 20500 bits when this exception occurs more often):

1259.6 Number of multicores required and size of the circuit could be derived for logdepth k=1437:
	O(N/(logN)^1437) = 2^20610)/(log(20610))^1437
	= 2^20610
	---------------  (for log(20610) = 14.33) 
	2^(1437*14.33) 
	= 2^(20610-20594)
	= O(2^(16)) = 65536 approximately which is not unusual for cloud computing mapreduce frameworks (though software version is under the purview of mapreduce class MRC) and supercomputers which are under true Nick's class - Fugaku Supercomputer has 158976 parallel processors

1260.1 Various forms of unique identification namely Face, Physique, Handwriting, Gender have been either theoretically analyzed or implemented in NeuronRain through graph theoretic and topological similarity algorithms based on Product Homotopy, Graph Isomorphism, Dynamic time warping timeseries similarity (of human physique mobility), Graph Edit Distance, Netrd Graph distances, TriMesh-QuadMesh and Topological homeomorphic deformations, Voronoi-Delaunay tessellation-triangulation,Maximum Common Subgraph,Approximate Topological Matching among others. 
1260.2 This update defines a new function fingerprint_recognition() in DeepLearning_ConvolutionNetwork_BackPropagation.py for matching two images of fingerprints (fingerprint1.jpeg and fingerprint2.jpeg) based on Kaggle academic research dataset FVC2000 for fingerprint deeplearning - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/peace1019/fingerprint-dataset-for-fvc2000-db4-b?resource=download thereby adding fingerprint dimension to unique identification arsenal.
1260.3 Function fingerprint_recognition() earlier defined computes contour segmentation by chain approximation for two fingerprints, finds the Hausdorff topological distance between two sets of contour polynomials belonging to either, and clusters the fingerprint contour polynomials of the two images by KMeans clustering algorithm in ImageGraph_Keras_Theano.py (contours_kmeans_clustering()) 
1260.4 Human fingerprints are topologically significant as every fingerprint contains clusters of curves or family of polynomials of almost similar curvature. Contour polynomials-Graph structure from fingerprints could be extracted by watershed, voronoi-delaunay and chain approximation algorithms in image_segmentation() and image_segmentation_contours() functions of ImageGraph_Keras_Theano.py 
1260.5 DeepLearning_ConvolutionNetwork_BackPropagation.py has been refactored as below:
	1260.5.1 TopologicalRecognition has been changed from a boolean flag to a string of 3 values - "Fingerprint", "Face" or "Handwriting" which are used within 3 clauses for invocation of face, handwriting or fingerprint recognition routines accordingly
	1260.5.2 Graphics for drawing K-Means clustering of contours has been changed from OpenCV drawContours() to MatPlotLib plot which differentiates the color coded clusters well. 
	1260.5.3 MatPlotLib show() invocations have been changed to savefig() to write the images for watershed segments, chain approximation contour segments, Voronoi-Delaunay, K-Means clustered contours as JPEG files.
	1260.5.4 Directory paths for earlier JPEG images written have been made relative by prefixing ./ and new folder RemoteSensingGIS/ has been created under python-src/testlogs
	1260.5.5 Following are the image files and logs for this update:

1260.6 Computational Hardness of unique identification has been studied in theory through collision resistance of hash functions, Minimal Perfect Hash Functions, birthday paradox et al. Designing a dispute-resistant foolproof Unique ID scheme for population and social networks is still a farcry. An example digitally signed unique id string digest for a person: <10-digit fingerprint>:<retinal scan>:<physique or face photo>:<written signature>:<voice>:<ip address or geocoded address>:<timestamp> though theoretically comprehensive, exponentially hard and collision-resistant suffers from lacunae - worn out biometrics-voicemetrics,signature forgery,prosthetics,cosmetic surgically modified eye,face and physiques might mar its efficacy essentially making a compelling case for non-biometric Non Fungible Tokens (unique private event,art and music) as unique id(s).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1261.1 AudioToBitMatrix.py has been updated to define a new function weierstrass_fractal_fourier_sinusoids(a,b,n) which implements celebrated Weierstrass Function,a fractal fourier sinusoidal summation that is continuous everywhere and differentiable nowhere which could be a candidate for AI fractal music synthesis by summation of damped sinusoids. This function computes the summation in a loop subject to the constraint (reference: 1261.4) and returns the fourier series as a huge string length of which is tunable depending on parameters a (coefficient),b (radian multiple) and n (maximum exponent).
1261.2 String for Weierstrass function returned from weiestrass_fractal_fourier_sinusoids() is passed on to notes_to_audio() as lambda function to evaluate. Weierstrass Function for an example set of parameters is written to testlogs/AudioToBitMatrix.log.MusicSynthesizer.Weierstrass.log.21June2022 and synthesized music waveform from Weierstrass function for a=0.5,b=5,n=20 is written to function_synthesized_music.wav loadable in Audacity.
1261.3 Music waveforms of arbitrary complexity could be synthesized from Weierstrass function by varying parameters a,b,n. Music waveforms are theoretically summation of multiple periodic waveforms - piecewise or continuous - which may be sinusoidal. Synthesizing music from mathematical functions so far is less of AI and more computational - Synthesizing human enjoyable (or discovering melodies from 68 billion 12-note possibilities - 1223.13) music through AI would hypothetically be as follows:
	for all a,b,n:
	{
	1261.3.1 Obtain fMRI imagery for Weierstrass Function synthesized music waveform stimulus for a,b,n (or) enumerate all 68 billion 12-note melodies
	1261.3.2 Label the fMRI imagery for "enjoyable" autobiographical memory evoking music as "potential candidates" e.g corresponding to "blue" regions of cortex in 1257.6 
	1261.3.3 Cluster or find similarities in the music waveforms for "potential candidates" - patterns found in music waveforms thereof could be generating functions for enjoyable music or melodies

1262.1 GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.py has been updated to implement statistical measure of Moran's I in a function urban_sprawl_dispersion() called as subroutine from urban_sprawl_from_segments(). Moran's I is proportional to gravity of an urban area and a quantifier of how spatially dispersed an Urban Sprawl GIS (diffusion factor) is in terms of tree canopy(NDVI),building coverage,land usage,transportation network among others.   
1262.2 Moran's I ranges from -1 (perfect dispersion) to +1 (lopsided dispersion) with 0 being the inflexion point(random dispersion). Color coded pixels of urban sprawl settlement GIS (SEDAC,HRSL,GHSL) are basically scatterplots of multiple land use segments (29-colored LUIS in 1174.8.5) and Moran's I of those urban sprawl GIS imagery is an analytics measure of equitable distribution of segments in an urban area.
1262.3 Function urban_sprawl_dispersion() internally invokes PySAL (Python Spatial Abstraction Library) implementations of Lat2W,Moran's I and Moran's p-norm and a new function image3D_to_2D() defined within ImageToBitMatrix.py for flattening 3D OpenCV2 array for an image to 2D array of dimensions height*width, entries of which are sum of RGB values of the respective pixel ordinates.
1262.4 Urban sprawl diffusion factor (Moran's I dispersion) is computed for (excerpts from testlogs/GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.log.23June2022.xz): 
	1) GHSL imagery testlogs/GHSL_GIS_ChennaiMetropolitanArea.jpg:

Merit of Social or Professional Profiles in candidate recruitment or complexity of Human Interviews/Contests/Question-Answering in its broader theoretical HR analytics context, have been central to the discussions throughout NeuronRain theory drafts supra formalized by a supremacy contrast between Hardness and Goodness of Majority voting and Hardness and Goodness of Intrinsic Merit. Recently there have two significant strides in AI - GPT3 and DALL-E - which are respectively *) AI text question-answering and *) text-to-image generation systems (converse of image-to-text ImageNet and could be thought visualizer for ThoughtNet and Autobiographical Memory Evocation) mostly driven by massive datasets and transformer attention sequence pipeline. Computational complexity of Question-Answering (Interview algorithm) has been theoretically analyzed in NeuronRain Design - in https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/Krishna_iResearch_DoxygenDocs/blob/master/kuja27_website_mirrored/site/kuja27/InterviewAlgorithmInPSPACE.pdf as Total Quantified Boolean Formulae(TQBF), a PSPACE-complete problem, and as Linear Threshold Functions-Polynomial Threshold Functions.
ChatGPT - an AI chatbot question-answering tool based on GPT3 - could be a frame of reference for evaluating open-ended human question-answering transcripts (a Turing test) by following algorithm:
        (*) Every question-answering pair from ChatGPT is mapped to a straightline and set of question-answer ordered pairs is mapped to a convexhull1 formed by intersections of halfplanes.
        (*) Every question-answering pair from humans is mapped to a straightline and set of question-answer ordered pairs is mapped to a convexhull2 formed by intersections of halfplanes.
        (*) Geometric Distance between convexhull1 and convexhull2 is objective, absolute score of Q&A correctness.
        (*) Algorithm for Mapping an answer to a straightline is subjective e.g. MD5 hash digest or Rabin fingerprint cryptographic hash of answer strings (from ChatGPT and Humans) is translated to slope of the straightline (0 to 360 degrees)

It is obvious that a non-blocking n-network is a rearrangeable n-network and a rearrangeable n-network is an n-superconcentrator ... The strategy of the lower bound proof is as follows. We associate with each input a neighborhood containing all vertices within a logarithmic distance of the input. We show that for a large set of inputs, these neighborhoods are disjoint (otherwise two inputs would be shorted by closed failures with high probability). This gives the lower bound for depth ...Theorem 1: Let Phi be a (1/4, 1/2) -n-superconcentrator.  For all sufficiently large n, Phi has size at least (1/256)n(log(n))^2 and depth at least (1/8)log(n)." - Circuit-switching circuits are theoretical random graph ancestors of present day Byzantine Fault Tolerant cloud computing (each switch maps to an edge with failure probability) and Cognitive automata Question-Answering machines are fault-tolerant switching circuits augmented with intelligence of the past which is lacking in Switching circuits model. Earlier lowerbound implies depth of Question-Answering circuit is atleast logarithmic and size is atleast polynomial in number (n) of vertex disjoint paths which does not rule of the possibility of parallelism in Question-Answering (reallife simulation of parallel Q&A could be non-trivial as interviews are usually sequential one-on-one and not many-on-many).

1265.2 Canny Edge Detector algorithm which is recently introduced in image_segmentation() could as well be used for detecting transportation network edges (rail,road) from an urban sprawl GIS map apart from Chain approximation contour polynomial segments subject to the constraint that the transportation network edges (roads and rail tracks) must be mostly straightlines.

Sources for these data are the DGSIE. The Travel time to the closest main (“IC/IR”2) railway station is used as a local amenities indicator and accounts for the proximity of the municipalities to both the public transport network and to secondary centres with retail activities. The Forest cover, expressed as the share of the total surface of the municipality covered by forest (CORINE land-cover database, European Environment Agency: http://www.eea.eu.int), is used as a green amenities indicator....To compare the different delineations of Brussels, the key variable of the model is the indicator of the accessibility to Brussels, since it will capture the influence of the city on its neighbouring areas. For that purpose, the Travel time to (the CBD of) Brussels, by car, in minutes and congestion included, is used (data from Vandenbulcke et al, 2007). In addition, a gravitational measure of the Accessibility to jobs is also used, and defined as follows: for each municipality i, this variable is equal to the log of the Shimbel index (of the travel time by car) between i and all other municipalities in Belgium, weighted by the total number of jobs (self-employed excluded) located in these municipalities in 2008..."

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1266.1 New python 3.7.x script EphemerisSearch.py has been added to NeuronRain AsFer repositories which imports SkyField
python astronomical algorithms implementation & defines a class EphemerisSearch containing following member functions:
	 ephem.sky_on_datetime((2022,7,7,1,15,30),"earth","mars")
    	 ephem.astronomical_event_to_search(planetradecdict)
    	 ephem.planetarium_search((2016,6,29,1,15,30),(2022,7,6,1,15,30))
1266.2 __init__() of EphemerisSearch.py downloads a NASA JPL Ephemeris (DE421 in this example - de421.bsp) and loads a timescale based on the ephemeris. 
1266.3 sky_on_datetime() accepts a datetime tuple (Year-Month-Day-Hour-Minute-Second shown in earlier example invocation) and converts it to Julian Ephemeris Date (denoted JD or JED) by utc(). Two parameters "earth" and "mars" in earlier invocation correspond to planet observed from (Earth) and the planet observed (Mars). Instantaneous Right Ascension and Declination of a planetary body is available by a call of observe() on observed from planet to the observed planet at the timepoint argument supplied to at(). Function observe() returns an astrometric object from which right ascension and declination are obtained by radec(). 
1266.4 Function planetarium_search() does the main computation by searching the ephemeris for all possible dates with in a range matching the query dictionary of planets-to-radec. This functionality of searching the dates of astronomical events is inherently supported by find_discrete() function of SkyField by doing a callback to a boolean function (radec_match()) passed on as argument which turns "True" whenever there is a match to ephemeris data on a specific date.
1266.5 Above facility notwithstanding, use of find_discrete() has been made optional by an if-else clause within planetarium_search() because of multiple internal exceptions within find_discrete() callstack of SkyField and an equivalent native bruteforce search is performed within a datetime range loop and a boolean function radec_match() returns True or False depending on ephemeris match for query on that date. Any new algorithm better than bruteforce search of astronomical objects to locate an event could be a breakthrough (Example: Given planetary ephemeris data for an event algorithm has to find the date of the event efficiently without bruteforce search, exploiting Chebyshev polynomial representation of ephemeris : Chebyshev(date) = Ephemeris and Inverse of Chebyshev polynomial for ephemeris data could be the date(s)).
1266.6 Ephemeris for datetime "3 July 2016 1 hour 15 minutes 30 seconds" is computed by sky_on_datetime() for all solar system planets and made into a query dictionary planetstoradecdict by astronomical_event_to_search(). Earlier ephemeris data is searched in two date ranges "29 June 2016 - 6 July 2022" and "29 June 2016BC - 6 July 2022" and match is found in the former as "planetarium_search(): found matching datetime =  2016-07-03 01:16:38 TT" while the latter throws exception "Exception: ephemeris segment only covers dates 1899-07-28 23:59:18Z through 2053-10-08 23:58:51Z UT" because of DE421 year limitations:
	ephem.planetarium_search((2016,6,29,1,15,30),(2022,7,6,1,15,30))
	ephem.planetarium_search((-2016,6,29,1,15,30),(2022,7,6,1,15,30),step_days=100)
1266.7 Arguments step_days is similar to find_discrete() for periodicity filtering of dates to search. In earlier example ephemeris match is computed every 100 days within the range instead of iterating for every day. Full logs of the computation and search are at testlogs/EphemerisSearch.log.7July2022.
1266.8 EphemerisScript.py has multiple uses across NeuronRain - Search of an astronomical event mentioned in an archaeological artifact, N-Body Choreography - Computation of Separation between astronomical bodies (by separation_from() API), Climate Analytics - analyzing gravitational correlations between periodicities of celestial bodies and terrestrial weather events.

1267.1 EphemerisSearch.py has been updated to compute and search for Longitude-Latitude degree position of solar system bodies
which is more compatible than Right Ascension-Declination convention. New match function latlon_match() has been implemented in addition to radec_match() which invokes SkyField ecliptic_latlon() for every observed solar system planet to compute their Longitude-Latitude(s). 
1267.2 Functions sky_on_datetime() and planetarium_search() take an additional parameter "position" which is valued {"latlon","radec"} to choose between radec_match() and latlon_match() within planetarium_search() and to print radec() or ecliptic_latlon() within sky_on_datetime(). 
1267.3 latlon_match() also computes the pairwise degree separation between solar system bodies by SkyField separation_from() which is crucial for solving an N-Body system particularly for finding correlations between (*) Sun-Moon-Earth 3-Body syzygies (180 degree separation - reference 1266.16) (*) Sun-Moon-Earth-Venus Lapses 4-Body System and Tropical storms (reference - 1266.18). 
1267.4 The planetary positions from SkyField ephemeris are compared to planetary positions from Maitreya 8t ephemeris and AstroPy ephemeris in planetarium_search() by subprocess.call() of maitreya8t and astropy_ephemeris().  AstroPy (for advanced astronomy and cosmology computations) has been integrated and positions of solar system bodies are printed within astropy_ephemeris().

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1269.1 Most of the boolean function complexity measures and algorithms (Grover search, Period finding, Element distinctness, Decision Tree,Block sensitivity,Deterministic and Randomized Certificate complexity,Degree of Polynomial Approximation of Boolean function) have been brought under the purview of what has come to be known as "Query complexity" mostly in quantum computation setting: Compute a function in n variables f(x1,x2,x3,....,xn) through set of queries to variables and Query complexity is quantified by number of queries.
1269.2 Every Question-Answering Merit problem which includes Examinations-Contests-Interviews methodologies of judging people merit by asking questions and evaluating answers (in HR-People-Talent Analytics) is theoretically a Query complexity problem which computes a function Merit(x1,x2,x3,...,xn) by queries to variables x1,x2,x3,...,xn where each variable could be a question and value assigned to variable its answer. 
1269.3 Query complexity thus generalizes all theoretical models of Question-Answering discussed elsewhere in this design - TQBF,LTF,PTF,Switching Circuits with Background Intelligence. Error in Question-Answering obviously reduces to Error in Query complexity based computation of Merit() function (or) Error in Query complexity = Error in computation of Merit() function = Error in any Question-Answering system (Examinations-Contests-Interviews)
1269.4 Error in Query complexity model of Intrinsic Merit Question-Answering could be equated to Condorcet Jury Theorem-Margulis-Ruzzo Threshold Majority Voting Group decision error (based on per voter p-bias) to arrive at a lowerbound (i.e equal error and completeness imply a lowerbound and one side of equality subsumes the other causing a collapse of complexity class) subject to constraints mentioned in tableau of bounded error (BP*) complexity class scenarios of Majority Voting + VoterSAT composition (Section 517).

1270.1 EphemerisSearch.py has been updated to define two new functions jplhorizons_ephemeris() and hubble_deep_field_RGB_analytics() which respectively integrate NASA JPL Horizons Online Ephemeris Lookup API Service and split Hubble Deep Field imagery into RGB Channel for Red-shift distance analysis of Galaxies. 
1270.2 jplhorizons_ephemeris() wraps the AstroPy AstroQuery NASA JPL Horizons Ephemeris API lookup service ephemerides() for a celestial body id, location (longitude-latitude-elevation) and epochs(range of dates for ephemeris).
1270.3 jplhorizons_ephemeris() is invoked within sky_on_datetime() if a boolean flag jplhorizons is set to True and the arguments are passed on as heterogeneous array jplhorizonsdata (id is number or name of body,location and epochs are dictionaries).
1270.4 hubble_deep_field_RGB_analytics() function takes an imagename which could be either a postcard that can be looked-up by ESAHubble.get_postcard() or name of a Hubble Space Telescope Deep Field image already downloaded. Image file is opened in Pillow Image and split into Red-Green-Blue channel ndarrays. Each of RGB channel ndarrays are flattened and histograms are computed per color channel.
1270.5 Percentage of Pixel colors are obtained from RGB histograms which provide a clue to the distribution and distance of the galaxies in Deep Field. Reddest galaxies are farthest away (gravitational red shift) compared to Green and Blue channel galaxies. Each of RGB channel data are written to FITS files analyzable by fv tool of NASA GSFC. FITS files created are at present removed because of huge sizes. 
1270.6 Sample computations of hubble_deep_field_RGB_analytics() for 13 billion light years old Hubble Ultra Deep Field Imagery HubbleUltraDeepField_heic0611b.jpg (containing primordial light 800 million years after BigBang and Inflation) from https://esahubble.org/images/heic0611b/ and sky_on_datetime()-jplhorizons_ephemeris() for solar system bodies identified by numeric id(s) have been captured (for a date range) at testlogs/EphemerisSearch.log.20July2022. Hubble postcard RGB analysis for J6FL25S4Q postcard id has been commented. 
1270.7 Following are the percentage of RGB galaxies by histogram analysis showing slightly higher number of primordial red galaxies than blue and green:
	('Percentage of Blue Galaxies (Closer) :', 0.0026145)
	('Percentage of Green Galaxies (Closer) :', 0.0011199375)
	('Percentage of Red Galaxies (Farthest - Red Shift):', 0.0032260625)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1273.1 extreme_weather_events_n_body_analytics() function in EphemerisSearch.py has been changed to add vantage point of the observation in NASA JPL Horizons Ephemeris as configurable parameter loc which defaults to "@earth-moon" barycenter and is invoked for location earth denoted by "@0". By changing loc to any other solar system body, N-Body gravitational accelerations for other planets could be found. 
1273.2 N-Body gravitational accelerations exerted on Earth during Extreme Weather Event days have been recomputed for location Earth instead of Earth-Moon barycenter and the Mercury-Venus high gravity phenomenon remains (Coincidentally GSP Sequence Mining analysis in Section 148 had found Mercury-Venus pattern in Seismic events earlier). Periodicities found in Gravitational Acceleration vectors through Hausdorff Distance earlier (~0.02 or 0.05), if established beyond doubt, would imply patterns in occurrences of extreme weather events and their predictability which is impossible at present. 
1273.3 New function WMAP_CMB_analytics() has been defined to read Cosmic Microwave Background temperatures data from AstroML WMAP dataset which are footprints of primordial universe before stars-galaxies formation (375000 years after BigBang and Inflation from quantum singularity or 13.77 billion years before present, which stretched the spacetime leaving microwave radiation as traces) and plots the spectrum using HealPy (tool for spherical coordinates) in two images: python-src/testlogs/WMAP_CMB_1.jpg and python-src/testlogs/WMAP_CMB_2.jpg.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1284.1 New Question-Answering Bot python implementation QuestionAnswering.py has been added to NeuronRain AstroInfer repositories within NeuronRainApps/QuestionAnswering/ which (*) takes questions from users as commandline arguments, (*) parses the question into a question textgraph, (*) computes dense subgraphs and core numbers of prominent vertices in question textgraph, (*) searches Wikipedia Corpus through wikipedia python API for top percentile core number vertices in question textgraph to get matching wikipedia pages, (*) for each matching wikipedia page gets the summary as the text "Answer" to the question, (*) parses the answer into an answer textgraph and (*) computes the degree attention of edges of answer textgraph and learns Query-Key-Value weights (by Perceptrons Gradient Descent) through rlfg_transformers_attention_model() function in RecursiveLambdaFunctionGrowth.py 
1284.2 The summary() function of wikipedia python API which wraps MediaWiki PyWikiBot interface of Wikipedia, provides a crisp natural language summary for the question keywords simulating a GPT3-like background intelligence which could be a Turing test.
1284.3 Transformers degree attention learnt for answer textgraph could be helpful in cherrypicking prominent and relevant edges of the textgraph vertices of which are highly interdependent thus aiding a traversal of the answer textgraph to print a natural language answer simulating summary() function of MediaWiki API.
1284.4 Following are 5 questions asked through commandline chosen from varied disciplines - Geography,Physics,History,Sports,Archaeology - and the answers from summary() and answer textgraph degree attention are printed to logs - Last two questions are sourced from OpenAI GPT3 QA examples - https://beta.openai.com/examples/default-qa. Note: Logs correspond to a variant of earlier script which directly searches wikipedia corpus instead of top core number vertices:
	python3.7 QuestionAnswering.py "which is the largest country in the world" 2>&1 > testlogs/QuestionAnswering.log1.2August2022 
	python3.7 QuestionAnswering.py "Define Theory of General Relativity" 2>&1 > testlogs/QuestionAnswering.log2.2August2022 
	python3.7 QuestionAnswering.py "Who is the Father of Indian Freedom Struggle" 2>&1 > testlogs/QuestionAnswering.log3.2August2022
	GPT3 - python3.7 QuestionAnswering.py "Where were the 1992 Olympics held" 2>&1 > testlogs/QuestionAnswering.log4.2August2022 
	GPT3 - python3.7 QuestionAnswering.py "Where is the Valley of Kings?" 2>&1 > testlogs/QuestionAnswering.log5.2August2022
1284.5 Relevance of answers to questions is along expected lines and multiple answers are allowed per question based on wikipedia matches. For Question 5 earlier following edges have top percentile Query-Key-Value weights laying emphasis on these words in a hypothetical natural language answer (a sentence containing discovery, exploration and land). An example natural language answer could be obtained from edges below by connecting the vertices by a WordNet path between them:
	Query weight for textgraph edge ( discovery , exploration ): 2.0132
	Key weight for textgraph edge ( discovery , exploration ): 5.0504
	Value weight for textgraph edge ( discovery , exploration ): 8.0876
	Query weight for textgraph edge ( discovery , land ): 3.0338
	Key weight for textgraph edge ( discovery , land ): 6.2636
	Value weight for textgraph edge ( discovery , land ): 9.4934
1284.6 Earlier Bot implementation could have sourced answers from Google search but wikipedia corpus has better open API access compared to Google search code for which has since been commented.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1285.1 In continuation of earlier commit, QuestionAnswering.py has been refactored and enhanced to choose edges of high Query-Key-Values degree attention edges learnt from wikipedia summary answer textgraph and automatically write an answer by concatenating all WordNet walks between vertices of those high degree attention edges. 
1285.2 AIQuestionAnswering() as a new function within QuestionAnswering.py has been supplied with lot of configurable parameters (questionfraction=5,maxanswers=1,keywordsearch=False,wsheading=False,answersliced=1,answerfraction=20) to respectively (*) choose fraction of question textgraph cores (*) restrict maximum number of answers per question (*) to choose between dense subgraph core number keyword search of question textgraph and direct question search without question textgraph (*) to choose between wikipedia summary and page headings for a search() query (*) choose only a slice of sentences from wikipedia summary() (*) choose Fraction of sorted Query-Key-Values degree attention for answer WordNet walk.
1285.3 rlfg_transformers_attention_model() function of RecursiveLambdaFunctionGrowth.py returns Query-Key-Values and Degree Attention as tuple
1285.4 Query-Key-Values attention for answer textgraph are stored in a dictionary of edges-attention, sorted descending and onlyanswerfraction of those edges are chosen to be part of answer generated by concatenating WordNet walks between all pairs of vertices of the chosen edges connected by "is a" relation (WordNetPath.path_between() is used for WordNet walk between vertices - Section 249).
1285.5 Some array overflow errors in Grafit/course_material/NeuronRain/LinuxKernelAndCloud/code/Transformers_PerceptronAndGradient.py which is part of Transformers implementation Grafit/course_material/NeuronRain/LinuxKernelAndCloud/code/Transformers.py have been resolved.
1285.6 An excerpt of answer written based on WordNet walk for question "Which is the largest city in the world" (logs have been withleld because of huge sizes (GBs) of Transformer Training iteration logs and only a minimum slice (1 sentence) of wikipedia summary() is used to minimize runtime). Bot generated WordNet walk answer simulates a deep learning human thought process in grasping a question on urban areas, less readability notwithstanding. Though Wikipedia summary() does a reasonably great job of providing very relevant natural language answers to natural language questions, it is not always reliable due to rare exceptions in which case an alternative answer source might have to be resorted to for answer textgraph creation. Question textgraph-Answer textgraph duo is a graph theoretic Meaning Representation,a drastic departure from conventional natural language question-answer pair and is useful in inferring first order logic sentences from lambda functions computed by Recursive Lambda Function Growth algorithm Beta Reduction and multilingual question-answering by mapping textgraph vertices in one language to another (Example: Earlier question is answered in First Order Logic and its equivalent lambda function as "There exist x,y - x and y are cities - For all y, x !=y and x is larger than y")

1285.16 GPT 3.5 - https://platform.openai.com/docs/model-index-for-researchers - Lambda Calculus Beta Reduction meaning representation in Recursive Lambda Function Growth (Graph Tensor Neuron Network in Section 412) could more accurately simulate a natural language writing by choosing a connective between every pairs of vertices in Lambda composition tree from a pretrained set of connectives (presently the connectives are restricted to WordNet relations "is a","has a" etc.,) - Example: Lambda function composition tree for Question "What states border Texas?" from Figure 14.14 of https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/14.pdf - "... λx.state(x)∧borders(x,texas) ..." could be reverse-engineered to natural language by choosing from synonymous connective phrases {"What","Which"} weighted by some pretrained attention model - If connective chosen is "Which" earlier question is reversed as "Which states border Texas?" though meaning represented is same. 
1285.17 Human Language Understanding and Reasoning - https://www.amacad.org/sites/default/files/publication/downloads/Daedalus_Sp22_09_Manning.pdf - Figure 1 - Prediction of word "Committee" in masked sentence "CLS Judicial <--masked--> Annual Report" as "CLS Judicial Committee Annual Report" by softmax(QK^T/sqrt(d))V) attention for each word. In the context of Lambda Function composition meaning representation example of 1285.16 - λx.state(x)∧borders(x,texas) - reverse engineering the lambda represented meaning to a sentence as "What States Border Texas" (or) "Which States Border Texas" is a perfect usecase for Transformer attention model that chooses the best Value (for a Query) between "What" and "Which". This requires a massive pretrained dataset matrix of connectives between all possible words in natural languge (English) - if English has a vocabulary of 1 million, a 3D weight tensor (matrix) of 1 million * 1 million * 1 million might have to be pretrained for all possible connectives between all word pairs (of course word inflections might have to be stemmed). For example while choosing the right connectives for λx.state(x)∧borders(x,texas) following weights matrix example might have to be pretrained:
        <>-state(s) :{What:0.2,Why:0.0001,Which:0.3,When:0.00000001,Then:0.000000001,...<entire vocabulary>}       
which has argmax for "Which" of maximum weight 0.3 filling the meaning as "Which" States Border Texas. Another example is the prediction of missing connective in lambda function "choose(best)" for which following entry of 3D weights tensor has to be looked-up as:
        choose-best:  {the:0.9,a:0.001,...<entire vocabulary>}
which has the argmax "the" predicting "choose the best" from lambda composition. Another major benefit of Transformer attention is in Vowelless Syllable Vector Text Compression (Section 2) in which missing vowel in compressed word has to be accurately predicted e.g - Word "Vowel" hyphenated as syllables "[Vow,el]" is compressed as "V-w-l" and could be decompressed by a pretrained Transformer attention model as "Vowel" - earlier pretrained weights tensor maxmimum likelihood model (Markov k-order) from an english dictionary is already implemented in NeuronRain.
1285.18 Markov Model of Natural Language - https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr05/cos126/assignments/markov.html - "... An Markov model of order k predicts that each letter occurs with a fixed probability, but that probability can depend on the previous k consecutive letters (k-gram). For example, if the text has 100 occurrences of "th", with 60 occurrences of "the", 25 occurrences of "thi", 10 occurrences of "tha", and 5 occurrences of "tho", the Markov model of order 2 predicts that the next letter following the 2-gram "th" is 'e' with probability 3/5, 'i' with probability 1/4, 'a' with probability 1/10, and 'o' with probability 1/20...." - Example texts generated by Markov k-order - Generative Pretrained Transformer attention models are in a way modern machine learning versions of Markov k-order models where order is replaced by attention.

1285.23 Artificial grammar learning meets formal language theory: an overview - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3367694/ - ".....  In particular, Chomsky pointed out that English cannot be captured by a regular or ‘finite-state’ grammar (FSG) because it includes structures (particularly, phrase structures with multiple long-distance dependencies and recursive sentence structures) that are beyond any FSA's capabilities. He further argued that various linguistic phenomena of movement and sentence transformation (e.g. from active to passive) are beyond the capability of context-free languages as well, and thus that natural languages must occupy some broader subset of the type 0 grammars (which he termed ‘transformational’). However, it quickly became clear that transformational grammars are in fact too powerful, requiring a cumbersome set of constraints to make grammars with this degree of power tractable. Subsequently, theoretical linguists working within this formal paradigm have gradually honed in on the level of computational power required for natural language [25,26]. After some years of suspicion that context-free grammars were up to the task, it is now clear that certain phenomena of natural language require context-sensitive grammars, and most researchers in this field now agree that human languages require ‘mildly context-sensitive’ grammars (MSCGs): grammars whose power is just a bit beyond those captureable by a context-free grammar [27–29]......" - Natural Languages require Mildly Context Sensitive Grammars (between Context Free and Context Sensitive) - References 25,26,27,28,29

There is another concept of ProofNet in Girard Geometry of Interation (GoI) where proofs are networks or graphs of MLL logical statements. Corpus search by GoI would require similar autoformalization of all available research publications to one giant proof network in MLL linear logic and search the GoI proof network for vertices matching the autoformalized query (a kind of concept search).
1285.28 Autoformalization with Large Language Models - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.12615.pdf - Case studies for translating natural language mathematics to Isabelle theorem prover code - Example - "Case Study 1 Question: "Prove that there is no function f from the set of non-negative integers into itself such that f(f(n)) = n + 1987 for every n." Codex Output: theorem fixes f :: "nat \<Rightarrow> nat" assumes "\<forall> n. f (f n) = n + 1987" shows False " - Following Question from IIT-JEE Advanced 2023 - https://jeeadv.ac.in/documents/JEEAdv2023_Paper1.pdf - could be autoformalized to Isabelle theorem prover code :
	Q.1 Let S = (0,1)U(1,2)U(3,4) and T = {0,1,2,3} . Then which of the following statements is(are) true?
		(A) There are infinitely many functions from S to T
		(B) There are infinitely many strictly increasing functions from S to T
		(C) The number of continuous functions from S to T is at most 120
		(D) Every continuous function from S to T is differentiable 
which is about set of all functions f:R->Z from real open interval (with gaps) to discrete integer set {0,1,2,3} and CNFSAT for above questions is (!A V !B V !C V !D) as none of the above are true as f can only be a partial function (and not a function) as it is not defined over 0,1,and real closed interval [2,3]. Manual effort in answering above question is non-trivial as notations of real intervals and integer subsets have to be reconciled with definition of a function and partial function (but could be autoformalized by a proof assistant). Advanced interpretation of above question also requires topological concepts of atlas of manifolds which are partial functions defined between two surfaces. If function implies partial function in above question then (A),(B) are true (CNFSAT: A V B V !C V !D)). An outline of CNFSAT learning algorithm based on Geometry of Interaction (GoI) for academic multiple choice question-answering similar to one above:
        1285.28.1 Autoformalize the query (question and 4 answer choices) in natural language to a linear logic GoI proof net theorem prover notation - results in a query graph of cut-eliminated sequent logical implications. Every sequent is the edge connecting two sets of logical statements.
        1285.28.2 Search the query (question along with 4 choices) proof net GoI graph within the gigantic GoI corpus graph sourced from all academic publications and textbooks (equivalent of proof-pile in 1285.27). Corpus GoI graph is pre-created by autoformalization to linear logic GoI proof networks, similar to query GoI graph (equivalent of search engine index for plain text search).
        1285.28.3 Find all subgraphs in Corpus GoI proof network graph (can be precreated and cached)
        1285.28.4 Find k-nearest subgraphs of query GoI proof net graph in Corpus GoI proof net graph ranked by graph edit distance (plain text) or number of mismatches in truth tables - each of the k query graph result could be a tuple of 4 graphs, one per answer choice. Every edge  (A,B) of GoI subgraph is a proof entailment morphism A |- B and GoI subgraph is, category theoretically, a quiver (Section 827).
        1285.28.5 Variables (one per answer choice) within the CNFSAT clause for the question are negated or not depending on boolean value of the corresponding query option proof network GoI matching subgraph in result tuple.
        1285.28.6 For question example above, matching k GoI subgraph quiver tuples (all related to partial functions) are retrieved from corpus GoI as (g11,g12,g13,g14),(g21,g22,g23,g24),...,(gk1,gk2,gk3,gk4) and evaluated for truth to learn the 4 variable clause per question (k could be restricted to 1 for one-shot learning).

Auction - related to 400,790,791 and all sections on Majority Voting, Auction Design, Mechanism Design, Economic Merit, People Analytics,
Quantitative Majority Circuit - 8 August 2022
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1286.1 Traditional mechanism of simultaneous ascending auctions for pricing commodities could be suitably translated to an Election Design
Mechanism which allows multiple rounds of voting and flexible values per vote by mapping ascending prices per round (or bidders up the ante every round) to votes by electorate (Price = Vote). 
1286.2 Following is a simplified example for Auction Design-to-Election Design translation involving 3 voters, 2 candidates and 3 rounds:
--------------
Candidate 1:
--------------
Round1 (all voters vote simultaneously per round by incrementing on previous rounds and votes are ascending monotone):
-------
Voter1 - (Round1, 10 votes), (Round2, 20 votes), (Round3, 40 votes)
Voter2 - (Round1, 20 votes), (Round2, 30 votes), (Round3, 45 votes)
Voter3 - (Round1, 5 votes), (Round2, 15 votes), (Round3, 55 votes - Highest Bidder)
Total votes for Candidate1 at the end of Round3: 140
--------------
Candidate 2:
--------------
Round1:
-------
Voter1 - (Round1,5 votes),(Round2,25 votes),(Round3,35 votes)
Voter2 - (Round1,15 votes),(Round2,30 votes),(Round3,45 votes - Highest Bidder)
Voter3 - (Round1,10 votes),(Round2,20 votes),(Round3,30 votes)
Total votes for Candidate2 at the end of Round3: 110
1286.3 Candidate1 wins over Candidate2 (Either by Highest Vote 55 to 45 or Sum of Votes 140 to 110) at the end of Round3. Number of votes per voter per round is arbitrarily non-descending and arbitrary increment-decrement of votes per round per voter is allowed. Multiround voting relaxes traditional voting by permitting voters to rethink decisions on earlier rounds (if negative votes are allowed,votes can descend in next rounds). Votes for Candidates earlier are stored (as secret ballots) either in a separate chaining hashtable or appended to a chronological blockchain per voter.

1287.2 Following are the sorted PageRanks of the textgraph vertices deep-learnt from the predictions for Pashupathi seal image through ResNet50:
[('brass', 0.2087566573359813), ('pickelhaube', 0.09785508542625027), ('shield', 0.06616892202346995), ('base', 0.05032584032207979), ('buckle', 0.05032584032207979), ('support', 0.026561217769994573), ('foundation', 0.026561217769994573), ('fasten', 0.026561217769994573), ('buckles', 0.026561217769994573), ('structure', 0.023920704153096214), ('covering', 0.023920704153096214), ('protective', 0.023920704153096214), ('helmet', 0.021808293259577533), ('worn', 0.021808293259577533), ('spiked', 0.021808293259577533), ('German', 0.021808293259577533), ('soldiers', 0.021808293259577533), ('usually', 0.01995993372774868), ('means', 0.01995993372774868), ('mouthpiece', 0.01995993372774868), ('blown', 0.01995993372774868), ('cup-shaped', 0.01995993372774868), ('wind', 0.01995993372774868), ('variable', 0.01995993372774868), ('instrument', 0.01995993372774868), ('consists', 0.01995993372774868), ('tube', 0.01995993372774868), ('funnel-shaped', 0.01995993372774868), ('length', 0.01995993372774868)]
1287.3 Seat of the posture is identified by ["base","support","structure","pedestal","foundation"]. Posture is identified by "buckles" (resembling folded legs of Mulabandhasana). Crescent Moon Crown is identified by ["pickelhaube","helmet","worn","spiked"]. Martial nature of the seal is deciphered by ["soldiers","shield","protective","instrument","brass"] perhaps indicative of a warfare culture.
1287.4 There are some out of place vertices namely "German" originating from "pickelhaube" which is German military helmet (Crown in seal is matched to German helmet by decode_predictions()). Apart from earlier figurine motif decipherment, ["funnel-shaped","cup-shaped","wind","tube"] seem to indicate rebus decipherment of the script on seal - coincidentally funnel-shaped,cup-shaped,wind and tube are related to respiratory tract and breathing exercises. Possible automated rebus decipherment from earlier predictions is (which is in no way a decipherment claim but could assist a manual decipherment): the script on seal might be a description on modus operandi of martial (weaponry) respiratory ritual (which could be yogic posture). 
1287.5 It can be observed from earlier ResNet50 (Version 1 and 2) predictions and the logs testlogs/ImageGraph_Keras_Theano.log.PashupathiSeal.9August2022 that ResNet50 produces more meaningful, contextually relevant predictions than ResNet50V2 (except "starfish" for fish shaped script on seal).

By rebus principle, common motifs in two artefacts should result in common predictions corresponding to the common motifs.

The conditional entropy of Indus inscriptions is substantially below those of the two biological nonlinguistic systems (DNA and protein) and above that of the computer programming language (Fig. 1B). Moreover, this conditional entropy appears to be most similar to those of Sumerian (a logo-syllabic script roughly contemporaneous with the Indus script) and Old Tamil (an alpha-syllabic script) and falls between those for English words and for English characters.....The conditional entropy of a token j following token i is defined as: ∑ P(i) ∑ P(j/i)logP(j/i) .... For most linguistic corpora, it has been found that the rank-ordered frequency fr of words can be fit very well to the Zipf-Mandelbrot law: log fr = a – b log(r + c) (7). .....we have found an excellent fit to the Zipf-Mandelbrot law with the values a = 15.39, b = 2.59, and c = 44.47 ....."-  (Equation S2) .... the bulk of the perplexity in the Indus corpus can be captured by a bigram (n = 2) (or equivalently 1st-order Markov) model as used in this paper.....We believe that answering the question of linguistic affinity of the Indus texts requires a more sophisticated approach, such as statistically inferring an underlying grammar for the Indus texts from available data and comparing the inferred rules with those of various known language families including Dravidian and Indo-European.....

1288.7 A STATISTICAL COMPARISON OF WRITTEN LANGUAGE AND NONLINGUISTIC SYMBOL SYSTEMS - [Richard Sproat] - Google - https://www.linguisticsociety.org/sites/default/files/archived-documents/Sproat_Lg_90_2.pdf - "..... Are statistical methods useful in distinguishing written language from nonlinguistic symbol systems? Some recent articles (Rao et al. 2009a, Lee et al. 2010a) have claimed so. Both of these previous articles use measures based at least in part on bigram conditional entropy, and subsequent work by one of the authors (Rao) has used other entropic measures. In both cases the authors have argued that the methods proposed either are useful for discriminating between linguistic and nonlinguistic systems (Lee et al.), or at least count as evidence of a more ‘inductive’ kind for the status of a system (Rao et al.).  Using a larger set of nonlinguistic and comparison linguistic corpora than were used in these and other studies, I show that none of the previously proposed methods are useful as published.  However, one of the measures proposed by Lee and colleagues (2010a) (with a different cut-off value) and a novel measure based on repetition turn out to be good measures for classifying symbol systems into the two categories.....Lee and colleagues develop two measures, Ur and Cr, defined as follows. First, Ur is defined as in 3, where F2 is the bigram entropy, Nd is the number of bigram types, and Nu is the number of unigram types.  F2 (3) Ur = log2(Nd/Nu) Cr is defined as in 4, where Nd and Nu are as above, a is a constant (for which, in their experiments, they derive a value of seven, using cross-validation), Sd is the number of bigrams that occur once (hapax legomena), and Td is the total number of bigram tokens; this latter measure will be familiar as n1 N , the Good-Turing estimate of the probability mass for unseen events (Good 1953, Baayen 2001).  Nd Sd (4) Cr = + a Nu Td Lee and colleagues use Cr and Ur to train a decision tree to classify symbol systems....."
1288.8 Inferring Grammars for Mildly Context Sensitive Languages in Polynomial-Time - https://static.aminer.org/pdf/PDF/000/311/015/learning_mild_context_sensitiveness_toward_understanding_children_s_language_learning.pdf - "...... In this paper, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for learning Simple External Contextual (SECp) languages from positive data. SECp languages are mildly context sensitive. ....." - Figure 2 Pseudocode for inference algorithm - Most natural languages are mildly context sensitive grammars (MCSG). Learning MCSG from an unknown set of symbols is archaeologically the decipherment of the script - for example, a Mildly Context Sensitive Grammar can be learnt by this algorithm from the Indus script symbol corpus which "computationally deciphers" the script.
1288.9 Efficient, correct, unsupervised learning of context-sensitive languages - https://aclanthology.org/W10-2904.pdf - Distributional Lattice Grammars for Natural Languages - Algorithm 1: DLG learning - Given a set of strings in a language L and membership oracle, this algorithm learns the DLG for the language - In the context of archaeological script decipherment, DLG learning could be worth trying as the membership oracle (set of all strings in undeciphered script) is available and it is not necessary to know the meanings of the script symbols to deduce the grammar (e.g Chomsky sentences are grammatically correct but meaningless - https://kuja27.blogspot.com/2018/04/grafit-course-material-chomsky.html). Deciphering the grammar of an unknown ancient script is in itself a breakthrough (let alone the semantics) as its equivalence to present era known natural language grammars could be investigated.

Instead, Earth’s plates might be shifting because the sun exerts such a strong gravitational pull on the moon that it has caused the moon’s orbit around Earth to become elongated.  Over time, the position of the barycenter — the center of mass between the orbiting bodies of the Earth and the moon — has moved closer to Earth’s surface and now oscillates 600 km per month relative to the geocenter, Hofmeister said. This sets up internal stresses, as the Earth continues to spin...."

1292.1 GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.py has been updated to rename and add parameters to function population_estimate_from_raster_georeferencing(geotifffile,longitude=None,latitude=None) as generic data_from_raster_georeferencing(geotifffile,shapes=False,longitude=None,latitude=None,bandnum=1,datatype="Population",windowslice=100) to facilitate window read of huge GeoTIFF raster files which cause VSIMalloc3() allocation memory errors within gdalnodatamaskband.cpp of GDAL C++ (known issue). Tuning GDAL_CACHEMAX does not solve the exception. 
1292.2 Boolean flag shapes optionally enables or disables masking of the raster to remove unnecessary pixels and computation of polygon shapes from raster. Parameter bandnum determines band number of the raster and windowslice configures the number of horizontal and vertical slices to tile huge raster files into smaller rectangular windows. Type of data analyzed is denoted by "datatype" argument (set to "Population" as default, other value being "Radiance"). 
1292.3 Rectangular window chunks are read from raster in 2 for loops by raster.read() and longitude-latitude value is searched in each window by index() which throws an exception if search fails. Exception is ignored and exhaustive search resumes(a Duff's device) scanning the whole raster till match is found. 
1292.4 Function translate_geotiff_to_jpeg(geotifffile,display=True,topx=0,topy=0,bottomx=1000,bottomy=1000,bandnum=1) has been updated to replace hardcoded band number. GDAL translate scaleParams are sourced from GetStatistics() as  gdal.Translate("testlogs/RemoteSensingGIS/"+jpegfilename[2] + ".jpg",geotifffile,format='JPEG', width=1024, height=0, scaleParams=[[statistics[0],statistics[1]]], outputType = gdal.GDT_UInt16)

1295.1 GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.py now imports fiona transforms and rasterio sample modules. Function data_from_raster_georeferencing(geotifffile,shapes=False,longitude=None,latitude=None,bandnum=1,datatype="Population",windowslice=100,sample=False) has been updated to add sample as a parameter.
1295.2 New if-else clause has been introduced which checks the CRS of the raster and if crs is (*) EPSG:4326 and if sample is enabled raster is sampled by sample_gen for data at a longitude-latitude coordinate and if sample is disabled usual window read scan of whole raster is performed to search for data at longitude-latitude (*) other than EPSG:4326 which could most likely be mollweide, EPSG:4326 source longitude-latitude reference system is transformed to destination mollweide reference system ESRI:54009 by reprojection and data is sampled by sample_gen at transformed coordinates.

1296. (THEORY and FEATURE) GIS Urban Sprawl Analytics - Facebook (Meta) High Resolution Settlement Layer (HRSL) and Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) GDAL-Rasterio Georeferencing - Gini Index of Population and Built-Surface - 28 August 2022 - related to 1174,1175,1179,1194,1211,1290,1291,1292,1295 and all sections on GIS Urban Sprawl Analytics, Merit of Large Scale Visuals, Gridded Population Estimators (SEDAC GPW4 and GHSL convex hull estimators), DBSCAN and Neural Network Urban Extent Learners, Computational Geometry, Intrinsic Merit Rankings, R Ricker Population Estimation, Community detection, Social Network Analytics, Space filling by Curves, Unequal Circle and Polynomial packing, Computational Geometry and Polygonal packing by Voronoi Tessellation, Four color theorem, Economic Merit, Computational Economics - GDP estimation from electricity consumption, Poverty alleviation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1296.1 GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.py has been updated to define two new functions (*) urbansprawl_gini_coefficient(urbansprawldata) and (*) urban_sprawl_from_raster(longx,latx,longy,laty,raster,dt) for computing Gini Coefficient measure of inequality in an urban sprawl statistical parameter and to wrap the longitude-latitude urban sprawl bounding box computation of data_from_raster_georeferencing() for a raster respectively.
1296.2 urban_sprawl_from_raster() is computed on following 2 datasets of GHSL R2022A Built-Surface and Facebook Meta HRSL Indian subcontinent Population for Chennai Metropolitan Area Longitude-Latitude (80.2707,13.0827) Bounding Box - (80.1,13.0) to (80.3,13.2):
    urban_sprawl_from_raster(80.1,13.0,80.3,13.2,"testlogs/RemoteSensingGIS/GHS_BUILT_S_P2030LIN_GLOBE_R2022A_54009_100_V1_0_R8_C26.tif",dt="BUILT-S")

1296.3 Following excerpts of Gini coefficient computations from python-src/image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/testlogs/GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.log.28August2022 for earlier Built-Surface and Population datasets ignore NaN values by math.isnan() filtering. Gini coefficient is defined as ratio of area bounded by hypotenuse and Lorenz curve to total area of right-angle triangle and ranges from 0 (complete equality) to 1 (complete inequality):
	Built-Surface - urbansprawl_gini_coefficient(): Gini Index of the dataset =  0.48700616284225207 (48.7%)
	Population - urbansprawl_gini_coefficient(): Gini Index of the dataset =  0.28008540547871624 (28.0%) ignoring NaNs.
1296.4 Disparity of 48.7% and 28% between Built-Surface (less equality) and Population (more equality) implies construction activity is not commensurate and hasn't caught up with burgeoning population.

(THEORY and FEATURE) GIS Urban Sprawl Analytics - Facebook (Meta) High Resolution Settlement Layer (HRSL) - Population estimation from GDAL-Rasterio Georeferencing - 30 August 2022 - related to 1174,1175,1179,1194,1211,1290,1291,1292,1295,1296 and all sections on GIS Urban Sprawl Analytics, Merit of Large Scale Visuals, Gridded Population Estimators (SEDAC GPW4 and GHSL convex hull estimators), DBSCAN and Neural Network Urban Extent Learners, Computational Geometry, Intrinsic Merit Rankings, R Ricker Population Estimation, Community detection, Social Network Analytics, Space filling by Curves, Unequal Circle and Polynomial packing, Computational Geometry and Polygonal packing by Voronoi Tessellation, Four color theorem, Economic Merit, Computational Economics - GDP estimation from Urban sprawl demographics, electricity consumption, Poverty alleviation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1297.1 GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.py has been updated to enhance urban_sprawl_from_segments() by adding a clause for looking up population value for a pixel in JPEG translation of a GeoTIFF raster by raster.xy() and compute population estimation based on it.
1297.2 Within translate_geotiff_to_jpeg(), gdal.Translate() has been changed to write JPEG file from GeoTIFF raster after scaling down X and Y sizes by function parameter scaledown. Scaling is necessary to reduce JPEG file sizes from actual raster dimensions. Scale parameters have been restored to [[0, 255, 0, 65535]]
1297.3 Function urban_sprawl_from_segments(image,segment,maximum_population_density=100000,sqkmtocontourarearatio=0,legend=None,sqkmareatopopulationratio=6.22,voronoi_delaunay=False,number_of_clusters=2,maxiterations=2,populationfromraster="None") has been updated to include an argument populationfromraster for name of raster TIF file. New if clause for reading a raster file has been introduced to find minimum enclosing circle of every contour in JPEG translation of TIF file and centroid of the enclosing circle. Pixel coodinates of contour centroids are lookedup in raster TIF of translated JPEG by xy() to find longitude-latitude after scaling up by factor scaleup to restore the coordinates to GeoTIFF dimensions as JPEG version is scaled down version of TIFF.
1297.4 Longitude-Latitude earlier is passed on to data_from_raster_georeferencing() to get population at the centroid coordinates within GeoTIFF raster. Scaling up and down earlier might cause some loss in pixel coordinate information because of integer division and actual longitude-latitude might vary and be inaccurate depending on scaling. Scaling has to be resorted to only when size of the raster and translated JPEG are huge and there are out of memory errors while loading. Setting scaleup and scaledown to 1 results in same size of JPEG as raster and doesn't distort the dimensions.Some example deviations due to scale up and down which are out 80-87 and 13-20 longitude-latitude bounding box ambit:
        urban_sprawl_from_segments(): raster xy longlat =  (87.66500000000613, 20.00638888888889)

        urban_sprawl_from_segments(): raster xy longlat =  (87.35944444445033, 20.00638888888889)
1297.5 Image file tokenization has been changed to remove hardcoded indices and replace them by last index of the tokens array in both ImageGraph_Keras_Theano.py and GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.py. Array length check in contours kmeans clustering has been added.
1297.6 Following are logs,contour-segment-tessellation-edgedetection images and some example population estimates computed within testlogs/GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.log.30August2022 for urban sprawl contour centroid long-lat (83.56,18.20) looking up Meta HRSL EPSG:4326 Raster FacebookMetaHRSL_IndiaPak_population_10_lon_80_general-v1.5.tif (not committed) bounded by longitudes 80-87 and latitudes 13-20 (unscaled GDAL translated JPEG testlogs/RemoteSensingGIS/FacebookMetaHRSL_IndiaPak_population_10_lon_80_general-v1.jpg is of size ~25 MB and slow to process which has been scaled to a factor of 50):

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1301.1 GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.py Polya Urn Urban Growth Model function polya_urn_urban_growth_model(image,ncoloredsegments,segmentedgis,iterations=1000) has been changed to add image filename parameter and allow arbitrary number of colored contour segments. Contours segmented earlier from a GIS JPEG image are iterated and an n-colored dictionary of colors-to-segments is populated by looking up the color of contour centroid pixel in image ndarray construed as color of the contour segment.
1301.2 Contents of Polya Urn before and after growth (by choosing a random colored segment and replicating it) are printed.
1301.3 GHSL SMOD R2022A Degree of Urbanization JPEG image from https://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ghs_smod2022.php for Chennai Metro Sprawl testlogs/RemoteSensingGIS/ChennaiMetropolitanArea_GHSL_R2022A_GHS_SMOD_DegreeOfUrbanisation.jpg which follows a 3-colored high level zoning (open space-water-vegetation, built space-residential, built space-non-residential) has been segmented for contours,watershed,canny edge detection and grown by Polya Urban Growth Model for 1000 iterations. Non-residential Built space includes both commercial and industrial areas. Following are affected image, DOT and log files:

1301.4 Differentiating Industrial and Commercial segments within Non-residential built space is non-trivial and necessary for 4-colored segmentation. While Polluting Manufacturing industries could be discerned by air quality index (PM2.5,PM10) from a datasource, for example, OpenWeatherMap Longitude-Latitude REST API - https://openweathermap.org/api/air-pollution, distinguishing non-polluting Manufacturing-IT-ITES from commercial activity is a problem unless they are of varying building heights or luminosity in NightLights data from VIIRS. Urban GDP Growth could be estimated from percentage growth of Urban centre (City), Urban cluster (Metro) and Rural outskirts between 2 releases of GHSL - for example growth of urban areas between R2019A and R2022A could be a training data for Polya Urn Urban Growth Model earlier for learning the replication rate of contour segments based on their color coding. To put things in perspective, growth of urban center of Chennai Metropolitan Area is 700% over a period of 50 years (1972-2022) which could be projected as growth rate of peri-urban metropolitan area.

Additional evidence provided by ancient tree rings suggests climatic variation may have been the nail in the coffin. Tree ring cross-sections taken from long-lived conifers indicate a major drought in Angkor towards the middle of the 14th century, followed by intense monsoons and then another big drought.  The problem was not drought or flood, but variability between both, Penny says. The collapse of the water network – due to a combination of intense summer monsoon rains and lack of maintenance – likely hastened the city’s desertion. ..."

1302.1 This commit adds a NeuronRainApps LIDAR usecase for Autonomous Driving - python-src/NeuronRainApps/AutonomousDriving/AutonomousDriving.py - which reads a LIDAR LAS format file, detects Ground and Other Obstacles based on Return Number of LASER pulse and writes a Lattice obstacle matrix which could be read by latticewalks.cpp (NeuronRain Grafit - Section 1294) to compute Obstacle Free optimal lattice walks. 
1302.2 Function read_lidar_stream() reads a LAS file simple.las (Laspy test dataset - https://github.com/laspy/laspy/blob/master/tests/data/simple.las) from LIDAR by laspy utility and finds points within a clearance query range parameter through KDTree representation of LAS point cloud. Rendering of simple.las Point Cloud through http://lidarview.com/ has been added to repository as PDF file simple.las.pdf showing number of returns and points per return number. 
1302.3 It also differentiates points as Ground points and Obstacle points based on return number of the point and total number of returns of a LIDAR pulse reflected from surface. Mostly points of return number equal to number of returns are bottommost and reflected from ground while other points of less return number are obstacles (trees,buildings) which are iterated and populated in a lattice array after scaling (captured in testlogs/AutonomousDriving.log.5September2022). Lattice array requires Terabyte memoryview() allocation and has been commented.

1302.4 Number of Returns and Return number in LIDAR - Graphic illustration - https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/data/las-dataset/what-is-lidar-.htm - "... Laser pulses emitted from a lidar system reflect from objects both on and above the ground surface: vegetation, buildings, bridges, and so on. One emitted laser pulse can return to the lidar sensor as one or many returns. Any emitted laser pulse that encounters multiple reflection surfaces as it travels toward the ground is split into as many returns as there are reflective surfaces.  The first returned laser pulse is the most significant return and will be associated with the highest feature in the landscape like a treetop or the top of a building. The first return can also represent the ground, in which case only one return will be detected by the lidar system. Multiple returns are capable of detecting the elevations of several objects within the laser footprint of an outgoing laser pulse. The intermediate returns, in general, are used for vegetation structure, and the last return for bare-earth terrain models. ..."

1304.1 GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.py has been updated to learn replication weights of Polya Urn Urban Growth Model sampling which chooses a random colored segment and replicates it while replacing, through function learn_polya_urn_growth_weights().
1304.2 Function learn_polya_urn_growth_weights(ncolorsegments_date1,ncolorsegments_date2) takes as arguments two n-colored segments of date1(earlier) and date2(later) computed from an urban sprawl segmentation by function polya_urn_urban_growth_model() and returns dictionary of replication weights per color as ratio of lengths of corresponding colored bins within Polya Urns of date2 and date1. 
1304.3 Function polya_urn_urban_growth_model(image,ncoloredsegments,segmentedgis,iterations=1000,replicationweights=None) additionally takes an optional argument replicationweights which is the dictionary of color-to-weights learnt by learn_polya_urn_growth_weights(). Polya Urn Growth routine has been rewritten, if learnt replicationweights are supplied, to replicate a randomly sampled contour color segment as many times as the color's weight lookedup within replicationweights which makes the Polya Urn Growth a Randomized Controlled Trial or a predictable randomization learnt from the past - contours of different colors grow at different rates based on past historical growth (typical preferential attachment or Rich-get-richer - a trend which may not be disrupted unless a radical new masterplan is drafted). 
1304.4 Percentage Growth of an Urban Sprawl after Polya Urn UGM process is printed as ratio of total number of segments (all colors) before and after Urn growth. Replication weights are learnt from two GHSL GIS Imagery separated by 3 years for Chennai Metropolitan Area Sprawl - testlogs/GHSL_GIS_ChennaiMetropolitanArea.jpg (R2019A) and testlogs/RemoteSensingGIS/ChennaiMetropolitanArea_GHSL_R2022A_GHS_SMOD_DegreeOfUrbanisation.jpg (R2022A) - and learnt weights are applied to project future growth after 2022 on R2022A testlogs/RemoteSensingGIS/ChennaiMetropolitanArea_GHSL_R2022A_GHS_SMOD_DegreeOfUrbanisation.jpg (Assumption: Same color coding is used across R2019A and R2022A and images approximately have similar scales)

1306.1 AudioToBitMatrix.py has been updated to implement new function music_synthesis(training_music,dur=5,samplerate=44100,polynomial_interpolation=True) which learns music (based on a boolean flag polynomial_interpolation) from training music waveforms by (*) interpolating training music to polynomials by polyfit() and computing a function over interpolated polynomials which is passed on to notes_to_audio() for synthesizing new music by tone() (*) or mapping training music waveforms to array of notes in CDEFGABC notation by hertz-to-notes and synthesizing signal frequencies (by random sampling) from training music notes collated to new music waveform by notes-to-hertz and tone()
1306.2 Invocation of SciPy barycentric_interpolate() which is a recent advance in Lagrange interpolation and could be better than polyfit() has been commented due to slowdown. Function computed over polynomial interpolation of music waveforms is simple summation at present and could be arbitrary. Synthesis by random sampling of notes from training music waveforms is discrete version of continuous polynomial interpolation and randomness could be replaced by a predictable sampling function. Synthesized music earlier (random notes sampling especially) could be one of the 68 billion 12-note melodies (Section 1223.14). Music synthesis by polynomial interpolation learning as opposed to neural network deep learning (which are threshold circuits) is more algebraic and closer to theoretical gadgets of polynomial threshold functions.

1307.1 AudioToBitMatrix.py has been updated to import librosa.display and librosa has been upgraded to 0.9.2. Function audio_to_notes() has been enhanced to set default duration and print Carnatic and Hindustani notes of a music waveform based on newly added support for Hindustani and Carnatic music in Librosa 0.9.2 through hz_to_svara_c() and hz_to_svara_h() API based on argument "music" set to default "Carnatic" - Index of mela has been hardcoded to 66.  
1307.2 Function music_synthesis(training_music,dur=5,samplerate=44100,polynomial_interpolation=True,polyfeatures=False) has been changed to exploit poly_features() API of Librosa which fits the spectrogram of a waveform to n-th order polynomial. If boolean flag polyfeatures is set to True, poly_features() of order-5 is invoked on stft() of the waveform to interpolate the spectrogram to degree-5 polynomial. Spectrogram Interpolation and music waveform are plotted as graphics and order-5 interpolation is chosen by polyfit() of timepoints versus degree-5 interpolation points. Use of polyfeatures refines the structural analysis of music waveform. If polyfeatures is False, behaviour is limited to usual polyfit() earlier. Synthesis by polynomial interpolation is a Waveshaping technique for turning simple sounds to complex sounds.
1307.3 Periodicity has been increased to 100 in notes_to_audio(function=synth_poly_string[:len(synth_poly_string)-1], fractal=False, periodicity=100). Librosa tone() synthesis has been further refined by abs() cast of frequencies.

Mathematicians like them for lots of different reasons, but computer musicians like them because they can be used to make weird noises, er, we mean music. These Chebyshev polynomials have the property that if you input a sine wave of amplitude 1.0, you get out a sine wave whose frequency is N times the frequency of the input wave. So, they are like frequency multipliers. If the amplitude of the input sine wave is less than 1.0, then you get a complex mix of harmonics. Generally, the lower the amplitude of the input, the lower the harmonic content. This gives musicians a single number, sometimes called the distortion index, that they can tweak to change the harmonic content of a sound..."

Notes based synthesis is more human than polynomial interpolation and strings of notes alphabets could be programmatically churned out. 
1308.2 Notes from virtual_piano_notes in usual CDEFGABC 12-note Piano notation [C, C-Sharp (D-Flat), D, D-sharp (E-Flat), E, F, F-Sharp (G-Flat), G, G-Sharp (A-Flat), A, A-Sharp (B-Flat), and B] are converted to frequency domain by note_to_hz() and signals are synthesized from them iteratively by librosa.tone(). Synthesized music is written to separate WAV file virtual_piano_music.wav and plotted as waveform by waveshow() - commented at present. Invocation of mir_eval.sonify.pitch_contour(librosa.times_like(freq),freq,samplerate,amplitudes=amps) has also been commented which is a music synthesizer similar to librosa.tone().

1310.2 Function all_12notes_melodies(iterations=10,number_of_notes=10,keynotes=88,tempo=0.25,musicgenre="WesternClassical")
has been changed to add music genre as parameter("WesternClassical" or "Carnatic") and if genre is Carnatic, notes basis is
a concatenation of 72 melakarta notes from librosa.mela_to_svara() which is randomly sampled to synthesize music. As number of possible
melodies in Carnatic are limited to 72000 (Janya or derivatives of 72), synthesis of Carnatic music must be a mathematical function of
72000 derived raaga(s). Existing state-of-the-art in music synthesis is centered around Deep Learning Convolution Neural Networks of huge parameter set and multiple convolution-maxpooling-perceptron layers. An alternative automata theoretic view of music envisages set of notes as language accepted by a finite state automaton. Ramifications of music as automata are enormous - synthesis of new music could be reduced to closure operators of Finite State Machines - Union, Intersection, Difference, Concatenation, Kleene Closure, Reversal, Homomorphism, Inverse Homomorphism - or new music is obtained from operand music FSMs through closures.
1310.3 Function get_piano_frequencies(virtual_piano_notes,genre="WesternClassical") has been changed to add genre of music as parameter.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
1311.1 Following example is a walkthrough of how a Music Synthesis based on Convolution Neural Network might look like and how formal language models and Boolean function composition might play a key role as Convolution Kernels in Hidden Layer and Maxpooling Layer of CNN, causing a merger of Boolean Function Composition, Computational Learning Theory and Machine Learning.
1311.2 For 7 music waveforms of 7 notes each following is an input 2D matrix of 7*7=49 notes in CDEFGABC notation:
				C-D-E-F-G-A-B
				F-D-C-F-D-A-D
				C-F-E-G-D-A-B
				F-F-E-F-G-A-D
				C-C-E-F-G-G-B
				F-D-E-F-G-D-B
				F-D-E-F-G-D-D
1311.3 For simplistic 1 Convolution Layer Kernel (which is a Majority function returning majority note in receptive field window of 3*3) of Stride=3 (window jumps 3 elements per entry) and 1 Max Pooling Layer (also a Majority function) - Majority() returns lexicographically maximum note in case of tie:
			Convolution Layer for input music earlier - Hidden (Majority function as Convolution Kernel)
			 	C-A-B
				F-G-B
				F-G-D
			Maxpooling Layer (Majority as maximum function)
				G
returning G as the most prominent note in 7*7 input 2D music matrix earlier. For massive input matrices, earlier convolution scales to millions of notes learnt in Maxpooling layer. Choice of Majority function earlier is only an example of how deep structure could be learnt (Usually convolution map kernels are bit matrices and convolution layer is computed by linear algebra of input and convolution kernel) and could be replaced by an arbitrary finite state automata learner per stride which replaces each entry of convolution layer matrix by an automaton learnt from receptive field window alphabets. Maxpooling layer likewise could be any of closure operator on automata (Union, Intersection, Difference,Concatenation, Kleene Closure, Reversal, Homomorphism, Inverse Homomorphism) in convolution layer. 
1311.4 It is obvious that earlier choice of majority function for convolution kernel layer and maxpooling layer indirectly implements a function composition of Majority of Majorities or Depth-2 majority. Replacement of Convolution Kernel and Maxpooling Layer by Automata Learners gives birth to a hybrid Deep Learner of Automata blending the power of Deep Learning, Function composition and Computational Learning Theory in one. 
1311.5 Music waveforms could be learnt by simple CNN implementation in NeuronRain - python-src/DeepLearning_ConvolutionNetwork_BackPropagation.py  by encoding notes to numeric frequencies in input matrix - which implements 1 Convolution Layer of 3 Kernels and 1 Maxpooling layer of 3 Kernels finally flattened and learnt by Perceptron BackPropagation. Massive Music waveform datasets require on-chip implementations of Deep Learning as input could be a million * million notes matrix.

1312.1 python-src/image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.py has been updated to compute total area of urban sprawl before and after Polya Urn UGM expansion simulation by sum of contour areas (cv2.contourArea()). Area computation reflects percentage growth of urban sprawl better than number of contour segments.
1312.2 Polya Urn contents are now tuples of the form (<colored_segment>,<contour_area>) for facilitating area computation.
1312.3 Function urban_sprawl_from_raster(79.07,12.41,80.3,13.19,"testlogs/RemoteSensingGIS/GHS_SMOD_POP2015_GLOBE_R2019A_54009_1K_V2_0.tif",dt="Degree of Urbanization") has been invoked for computing Degree of Urbanization of Chennai Metropolitan Area for R2019A dataset from R2019A GHS-SMOD DEGURBA GeoTIFF raster testlogs/RemoteSensingGIS/GHS_SMOD_POP2015_GLOBE_R2019A_54009_1K_V2_0.tif. There is no visual explorer available for R2019A GHS-SMOD as datasets have been replaced by R2022A and Polya Urn UGM has to be populated from settlement classes of the raster pixels instead of contour segments (classes listed in 1312.7). Following are some examples of classes printed from raster for bounding box coordinates: 
Degree of Urbanization from raster: [array([30], dtype=int16)]
Degree of Urbanization from raster: [array([30], dtype=int16)]
Degree of Urbanization from raster: [array([10], dtype=int16)]

1313.1 New function compare_raster_data(raster1data,raster2data) computes dictionary histograms from longitude-latitude rectangle bounding boxes data returned by urban_sprawl_from_raster() for 2 GeoTIFF Rasters of 2 time points belonging to same genre. Two Rasters of same datatype (e.g Degree of Urbanization - R2019A and R2022A) are separated by time duration which could be in years. This kind of comparison has no assumption on scale of imagery as same longitude-latitudes are taken into account.
1313.2 Contents of 2 Dictionary histograms are iterated and percentage change of each bin is printed (as 100*(earlierdate - laterdate)/earlierdate) - Negative percentages imply expansion and Positive percentages imply contraction. Following 2 rasters from GHSL SMOD R2019A and R2022A are compared for change in urbanization between Chennai Metropolitan Sprawl Bounding Boxes of same dimensions and ordinates separated by 3 years:

1313.4 Gini coefficient of inequality has increased from 0.17 to 0.19 in 3 years. Following urban and water classes have undergone expansion between 2019 and 2022 for same Chennai Metropolitan Area bounding box sprawl (by negative percentages earlier coinciding with or even bettering Image Facegraph Polya Urn UGM projections):

— Class 21: “Suburban or per-urban grid cell”, if the cell belongs to an Urban Cluster cells at first (Massive 2634% expansion implying suburban fringe has witnessed an abnormal boom)
— Class 10: “Water grid cell”, if the cell has 0.5 share covered by permanent surface water and is not (7% expansion of waterbodies)
1313.5 Following rural classes have contracted between 2019 and 2022 (by positive percentages):
— Class 13: “Rural cluster grid cell”, if the cell belongs to a Rural Cluster spatial entity; (99% decrease in rural clusters)
— Class 12: “Low Density Rural grid cell”, if the cell is classified as Rural grid cells at first hierarchical
level, has more than 50 inhabitant and is not part of a Rural Cluster; (14% decrease in low density rural regions)
— Class 11: “Very low density rural grid cell”, if the cell is classified as Rural grid cells at first hierarchical (68% decrease in very low density rural regions)

1314.1 complement.py has been changed to import barycentric_interpolate(), lagrange() interpolators in SciPy and to plot the complement polynomial in matplotlib.
1314.2 Function  complement_diophantine(enumerableset, interpol_algorithm="barycentric") has been changed to add parameter "interpolation_algorithm" and clauses to fit the elements of a complementary set to a polynomial by polyfit, barycentric interpolation or Lagrange interpolation based on values to interpol_algorithm={'polyfit','barycentric','lagrange'}.

1314.4 There is a Taylor series interpolation variant which approximates a function at pre-defined point in terms of existence of derivatives at that point.

1314.5 Polynomial interpolations could serve as tools to quantify Question-Answering as polynomials where set of ordered pairs (question(i),score_for_answer_to_question(i)) are interpolated. Section 864.63 of NeuronRain Design - https://neuronrain-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ - delves into learning theory and complexity lower bounds aspects of Question-Answering in multiple choice and boolean setting. Complementation has nice implications for Question-Answering in boolean setting E.g. For 10 Questions of Binary Yes-No answers, if all 10 questions are answered correctly in the form of a vector [1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0] and interpolated by a polynomial over GF[2], its complement polynomial over GF[2] represents "all wrong answers" defined by complement vector [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1].

1317.1 python-src/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized_MultipleIntegers.py has been upgraded to Python 3.10.4 and 51 consecutive integers from 1000 to 1050, 101 consecutive integers from 10000 to 10100 and 101 integers from 20000 to 20100 have been factorized by Computational Geometric Factorization (253 integers in total). 
1317.2 Benchmark runtime numbers for factoring 20000 to 20100 have been plotted as observed curve against a theoretical curve for k*logN*logN for k=1 (testlogs/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized_MultipleIntegers.jpg). Factors are captured in testlogs/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized_MultipleIntegers.log.29September2022 (1000 to 1050), testlogs/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized_MultipleIntegers.log2.29September2022 (10000 to 10100) and testlogs/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized_MultipleIntegers.log3.29September2022 (20000 to 20100). Earlier consecutive integers factorization includes primes.
1317.3 Actual versus theoretical runtime curves of testlogs/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized_MultipleIntegers.jpg are in concurrence and the few spikes could be latencies due to Python Virtual Machine Garbage collection, CPU and Spark scheduling vagaries.

1318. (THEORY and FEATURE) GIS Weather Analytics and Climate Analytics - 3 October 2022 - related to 148,445,446,463,1165,1171,1176,1266,1289,1316 and all sections on Correlation between gravitational effects of Mined Celestial N-Body Patterns and terrestrial extreme weather events (or Gravitational effects on climate change), Drone natural obstacle avoidance, Drone autonomous online shopping delivery, Drone Electronic Voting Machine, Large Scale Visuals Recognition, Artificial Intelligence models for Climate Change, Astronomical algorithms
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
1318.1 GISWeatherAnalytics.py has been updated to integrate N-Body Gravitational Acceleration computation for Solar System bodies implemented in EphemerisSearch.py to correlate climate events and gravitational pull of Solar system N-Body celestial choreographies on Earth and Ocean surface (especially role of Syzygies of solar system bodies). While Sun-Earth-Moon Syzygy has been widely studied and found to have high correlation to storm intensification (Sections 1266,1289,1316), gravitational influence of rest of Solar system planets on Earth has been less studied in literature.
1318.2 Function climate_analytics(datasource,date="",time="") has been changed to include a clause for "n-body-analytics" datasource which accepts an array of extreme weather event dates, instantiates Ephemeris object (NASA JPL DE421 Ephemeris) and invokes extreme_weather_events_n_body_analytics() on those dates to compute gravitational pull and pairwise angular separation of solar system bodies. 
1318.3 Function climate_analytics(datasource="n-body-analytics",date=datesofstorms) is invoked for following formation dates of storms:
	1318.3.1 North Atlantic Hurricanes - Harvey (Category 4 - 17 August 2017), Irma (Category 5 - 30 August 2017), Ian (Category 4 - 23 September 2022) 
	1318.3.2 Bay of Bengal - Very Severe Cyclonic Storms - Amphan (20 May 2020),Gaja (10 November 2018),Vardah (6 December 2016),Thane (25 December 2011),Ockhi (29 November 2017) 
1318.4 Following are excerpts of angular separations for Sun-Moon and Venus-Mercury from testlogs/GISWeatherAnalytics.log.3October2022 for earlier storms:
	Angular separations for  Venus-Mercury : [<Angle 51deg 49' 11.5">, <Angle 26deg 43' 05.0">, <Angle 09deg 23' 44.3">, <Angle 04deg 59' 58.7">, <Angle 44deg 15' 04.4">, <Angle 23deg 56' 21.0">, <Angle 54deg 10' 52.4">, <Angle 31deg 00' 20.5">]
	Angular separations for  Sun-Moon : [<Angle 63deg 35' 41.0">, <Angle 97deg 36' 37.7">, <Angle 33deg 52' 36.9">, <Angle 30deg 22' 33.5">, <Angle 28deg 39' 00.4">, <Angle 73deg 45' 38.6">, <Angle 04deg 17' 26.3">, <Angle 117deg 39' 43.0">]
1318.5 Angular separations of Venus-Mercury range from 4 to 54 degrees for all storms which could perhaps be anecdotal evidences for 1266.18 indicating a synergy of Venus and Mercury and not just Venus. Correlation between lowest pressure (millibar) of the storm and angular separations of solar system bodies earlier could be of importance.

1319.1 Updated python-src/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized.py to import numba JIT (Just In Time)
python compiler that achieves upto 20X speedup on Numeric Python-Scientific Python and Loops computation.
1319.2 Maximum number of factors found per integer has been made configurable by maxfactors. DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized.py is a Parallel Planar Point Location Factoring implementation on MapReduce that is inherently capable of finding all factors by parallel invocation of local sequential binary or interpolation search ((logN)^k sequential binary or interpolation searches of logN or loglogN time each on N/(logN)^k PRAMS-Multicores which is NC(k) contained in DMRC(k-1)) while traditional factorization is mostly limited to finding one factor alone (all factors of N can be recursively found by applying same algorithm - whether it is Quadratic Sieve,Dixon,Pollard-Rho or CADO-NFS - on N/f(prev) where f(prev) is the last factor found).
1319.3 Restricting the number of factors per integer is necessary for accurate benchmarking as different integers have different number of factors and number of factors has to be same across the board. 
1319.4 Function tilesearch_nonpersistent(y,numfactors=maxfactors) and binary_search_interval_nonpersistent(xl, yl, xr, yr, numfactors=3) have been updated to pass on maxfactors as parameters which is checked by an inequality clause on length of _value field of factors Spark accumulator.
1319.5 All functions have been decorated by @jit(parallel=True) directive of Numba for enabling parallelism but commented due to compile errors per caveats in Numba documentation - https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/reference/pysupported.html#pysupported.
1319.6 101 consecutive 22-bits integers from 3203023 have been factorized by restricting the maximum number of factors per integer to 3 and their actual and theoretical (O(logN)^2 for BigO constant 1) runtimes have been plotted in python-src/testlogs/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized_MultipleIntegers.jpg:

1319.7 Theoretical and Actual runtime curves in python-src/testlogs/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized_MultipleIntegers.jpg match except spikes caused by Spark Executor while doing a futile search for non-trivial factors in following integers which are primes (independently verified by Google Prime Search e.g https://www.google.com/search?q=3203117+prime) - 3203041,3203047,3203059,3203063,3203071,3203093,3203099,3203107,3203111,3203117. It is worth observing to note that spikes for primes in actual runtime curve touch the theoretical curve for upperbound of O(logN*logN).

	Percentage change in  10 : -6.747230614300101 (6% expansion of waterbodies versus 7% in 1313)
1320.4 Raster comparison and growth trends earlier could be used as guiding principles in Urban sprawl delineation, DNFMAXSAT Urban sprawl facegraph MARA and weights learning in Polya Urn UGM:
	1320.4.1 Heavy expansion of Urban centre, Dense-Semidense Urban clusters and Periurban Pixel classes - 21,23,22 - imply an urban sprawl extension qualifying them for inclusion in metropolitan jurisdiction. In earlier example massive expansion of 2355% in suburban (class 21) and 700% in semidense urban cluster-metro (class 22) pixels show a sudden spurt in urbanization in 3 years along peripheries. 
	1320.4.2 Heavy contraction of rural clusters and waterbodies implies depletion of greenery and natural resources. Disproportionate growth percentages between settlements and waterbodies might require corrections.

1322.1 This commit resolves JIRA issue https://krishnairesearch.atlassian.net/browse/NEUR-1 concerning problem within python-src/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized.py in finding square roots,a very important special case of factorization. It is worth noting that Newton-Raphson square root algorithm is polylogarithmic - O((logN)^k*loglogN) - which is used for approximate factor rayshooting queries in algorithm of https://kuja27.blogspot.com/2018/04/grafit-course-material-newton-raphson.html - and Computational Geometric Factorization implies general cases of primality testing and factorization are polylogarithmic (O((logN)^kloglogN) if interpolation search is employed) as well which includes almost-squares (integer squareroots). Principal Ideal Algebraic Geometry and Differential Calculus involved in computation of arithmetic progression hyperbolic arc rasterization (rectification) are quite similar to Newton-Raphson algorithm:
	tile_segment of length delta (from first derivative - tangent - of hyperbolic arc at x) = N/x - N/(x+delta) = N *[delta/x(x+delta)] or N/(x(x+1)) for delta=1
1322.2 New clause has been added to handle when intervalmidpoint of binary search is 0 and tile x and y ordinates are equal. 
1322.3 Multiple Consecutive integers from 50000 to 50100 have been factorized and following primes have been captured in python-src/testlogs/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized_MultipleIntegers.log.10October2022 (spikes in runtimes):

1323.1 GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.py has been updated to define new function three_dimensional_urban_growth_model(rasterdata_2d,rasterdata_3d) for computing third dimension (height) from two histograms for 2D raster and 3D raster for any datatype. This function takes as input the data for 2 rasters of 2D (Surface) and 3D (Volume) from urban_sprawl_from_raster(), populates 2 defaultdict() histogram dictionaries from them, sorts the 2 histograms by values of the pixels and computes the third dimension (height) by fraction of maximum elements in the two histograms (Volume/Surface) which is an estimate of the height. GHSL Data Package 2022 report has more on definitions of ANBHx (Building height), BUVOL (Building volume) and BUSURF (Building surface) in Reference 1323.6.

1324.1 python-src/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized.py b/python-src/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized.py has been updated to import joblib Parallel processing framework.
1324.2 Factors accumulator Spark Global variable has been updated within each clause of factor criteria which was printing wrong factors earlier though factors were correctly computed. 
1324.3 New function parallel_tile_segments() has been defined and Numba JIT decorated for computing tile segments in parallel which is computed sequentially at present. 
1324.4 Function SearchTiles_and_Factorize(n, k, Parallel_for="False") has been changed to add a boolean flag Parallel_for to choose between parallel version and sequential version of for loop. If Parallel_for is set to False tiles computation for loop is sequential.
1324.5 If Parallel_for is set to True following commented sequential for-loop code block is replaced by joblib Parallel() processing which parallelly invokes parallel_tile_segments() by setting n_jobs=<number of multicores> followed by Spark parallelize() of the 2D array which is flattened to 1D array by flatMap() and foreach() is invoked in the end - parallel version of a doubly nested for loop. This triply speeds-up the hyperbolic arc bow segmentation by combining Spark Parallelize() + Numba JIT + Joblib Parallel(). Caveat: Following sequential for loop implements (logN)^k PRAMs * N/(logN)^k tiles = N which is DMRC simulation of NC necessitated by hardware limitations and not N/(logN)^k PRAMs * (logN)^k tiles = N which is true NC though effective work is same. Tile segments computed are stored in a huge 2D array in-memory and number of jobs in joblib have to be set to N/(logN)^k equal to number of multicores-PRAMs in NC-DMRC-MapReduce cloud to prevent out of memory errors - requires a Supercomputing or Large cloud infrastructure of massive multicores-PRAMs - for huge integers normal desktop configurations might not work:   
            #((logN)^k sequential binary or interpolation searches of logN or loglogN time each on N/(logN)^k PRAMS-Multicores
            #for x in range(int(polylog_n)):

            #    print("tiles_end:", tiles_end)
            #    tiles = list(range(tiles_start, tiles_end))

            #    tiles_start = tiles_end
            #    tiles_end += tiles_per_PRAM
            #    if len(factors_accum.value) > maxfactors:
            #        break
            #Earlier sequential for loop is parallelized by joblib to obtain a 2D array of set of tile segments followed by another nested parallelize() for each tile segment 1D array 
            tile_segments=Parallel(n_jobs=4)(delayed(parallel_tile_segments)(tiles_per_PRAM,x) for x in range(int(polylog_n)))
            print("tile_segments:",tile_segments)
            spcon.parallelize(tile_segments).flatMap(lambda x: x).foreach(tilesearch_nonpersistent)

1325.1 python-src/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized.py has been updated to get maximum number of factors from commandline. If argv[5] is set to "all"
factorization is unlimited and all factors (limited by sys.maxsize) are parallel-planar-point-located.
1325.2 tiles_start is now set to begin from square root of the integer to be factorized instead of 1 earlier (factors are symmetric on either halves of the hyperbolic arc separated by (sqrt(N),sqrt(N)) point) as an optimization because almost all CPUs now support division-square_root instructions in their instruction sets which are implemented by Digit Recurrence Algorithm of low complexity. GCC square root functions internally invoke square root assembly instructions and it has been assumed that Python math.sqrt() internally is bytecode compiled to CPU sqrt instruction. Being hardware implementation square root might only add a polylogarithmic overhead or even less.

SV simulators, also known as “full-state”, “brute-force” and “Schrödinger-style” simulators, maintain a complete numerical description of the evolving quantum state of a quantum circuit. As such, they require memory that scales exponentially with the number of qubits in the circuit, but their runtime scales linearly with the quantum circuit depth. Since their complete quantum state output permits the precise and efficient a posteriori calculation of any property, they are the conventional first choice of simulator for much of quantum computing research.... In a State-vector (SV) simulation, an N-qubit register is represented by a state-vector of 2^N complex amplitudes and can be numerically instantiated as an array of 2×2^N real floating-point numbers. SV simulation of N=40 qubits at double precision would therefore require 16,384 GiB, well beyond the capacity of a typical HPC compute node. This makes the use of distributed memory systems essential. To date, large-scale SV simulations were performed exclusively on purpose-built supercomputers and required a long lead time just to allocate the resources...." - Presently only known quantum factoring algorithm due to [Shor] is in BQP. Computational Geometric Factorization by Parallel Planar Point Location in NeuronRain is classical algorithm in class NC or DMRC depending on hardware and MapReduce software used. Classical simulation of period finding or modular exponentiation part of Shor's quantum algorithm (which finds period r of a^r = 1 mod N by quantum Fourier transform) if represented as quantum circuit and simulated by State-Vector simulators could iteratively zero-in-on the factor in classical setting and classical runtime might require only a linear overhead.

In the example derandomization gadget of section 1152 (https://neuronrain-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which is boolean function composition of Majority + BQPVoterSAT, all voters are homogeneous and their private signals are the quantum oracles which factor a common-knowledge integer N by Shor's BQP factorization algorithm. By Condorcet Jury Theorem,Weak Law of Large Numbers and definition of BQP every voter is atleast 67% right and collective decision tends to 100% correctness miracle asymptotically implying exact (but Las Vegas) quantum factorization which could be in class EQP (and boolean Majority+BQPVoterSAT composition might be relativizable as NC^ZPP^BQNC since factorization by quantum fourier transform is known to be in ZPP^BQNC).

Democracy with 99 percent ignorance looks a lot more like democracy with full information than democracy with total ignorance. Why? First, imagine an electorate where 100 percent of all voters are wellinformed. Who wins the election? Trivially, whoever has the support of a majority of the wellinformed. Next, switch to the case where only 1 percent of voters are well-informed. The other 99 percent are so thick that they vote at random. Quiz a person waiting to vote, and you are almost sure to conclude, with alarm, that he has no idea what he is doing.  Nevertheless, it is basic statistics that—in a large electorate—each candidate gets about half of the random votes. Both candidates can bank on roughly a 49.5 percent share. Yet that is not enough to win. For that, they must focus all their energies on the one wellinformed person in a hundred. Who takes the prize? Whoever has the support of a majority of the well-informed.  This result has been aptly named the “miracle of aggregation.” It reads like an alchemist’s recipe: mix 99 parts folly with 1 part wisdom to get a compound as good as unadulterated wisdom. An almost completely ignorant electorate makes the same decision as a fully informed electorate ..."

New function predict_EWE(datefrom,dateto,loc,bodypair,angularsepbounds) has been implemented to obtain dates range from user for a Longitude-Latitude location, Solar system body pair, range of angular separations between the pair and search the dates range for matching angular separations (SkyCoord.separation()) between the pair of celestial bodies by Angle.is_within_bounds() which could be potential days of extreme weather events (heavy rain or cyclonic storms in this case).
1327.3 JIRA Bug NEUR-6 raised earlier concerns erroneous overwrite of datesofEWEs variable and the problem in vectors() invocation on Horizons() object when Longitude-Latitudes are supplied. Problem is due to the lack of support for Longitude-Latitude in vectors_async() code at https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_modules/astroquery/jplhorizons/core.html which raises exception ValueError(('cannot use topographic position in state vectors query')) if location is a dictionary of Longitude-Latitude. As an alternative to dictionary, location could be one of the 2300 pre-defined earth sites in https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons/manual.html#center which is a numeric id and not in Longitude-Latitude format. But there doesn't seem to be a comprehensive documentation of 2300 earth site codes except 500 which is geocenter. 
1327.4 From AstroQuery JPL Horizons documentation https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jplhorizons/jplhorizons.html only following locations are supported by Horizons.vectors() though ephermerides() supports Longitude-Latitude dictionaries for locations but there is no API support to map ephemerides() data to vectors() format:
	-------------------------------------------------
	Method location refplane refsystem astropy frame
	-------------------------------------------------
	.vectors() '@0' 'ecliptic' N/A 'custombarycentricecliptic'
	.vectors() '@0' 'earth'    N/A 'icrs'
	.vectors() '@10' 'ecliptic' N/A 'heliocentriceclipticiau76'
1327.5 Because of earlier AstroQuery-AstroPy limitations (or could imply Longitude-Latitude is not necessary for vectors computation) Longitude-Latitude arguments are ignored (ephemerides() invocation has been commented which could be reverted if there is an API support for ephemerides() to vectors() conversion) at present and replaced by hardcoded "@0" as below: 
                    obj = Horizons(id=i, location="@0", epochs=Time(str(date[0])+"-"+str(date[1])+"-"+str(date[2])).jd, id_type='id').vectors(refplane="earth")
1327.6 predict_EWE() is invoked to search for matching angular separations between 2 solar system body pairs "Sun-Moon" and "Venus-Mercury" respectively of separation ranges (120-180 degrees) and (0-30 and 0-60 degrees) for dates between 21/10/2022 and 1/12/2022 to match for Sun-Moon-Earth and Venus-Mercury-Earth 3-body syzygies which have been investigated in 1266,1267,1268,1316 and 1318 supra:
    predict_EWE(datefrom=(2022,10,21,1,00,00),dateto=(2022,12,1,1,00,00),loc='@0',bodypair="Sun-Moon",angularsepbounds=('120d','180d'))
    predict_EWE(datefrom=(2022,10,21,1,00,00),dateto=(2022,12,1,1,00,00),loc='@0',bodypair="Venus-Mercury",angularsepbounds=('0d','30d'))
1327.7 Following dates match earlier angular separation bound Syzygy queries which coincide with active North-East Monsoon and Bay of Bengal Cyclone seasons in peninsular India predicting heavy rainfall - this forecast differs from MaitreyaEncHoro_RuleSearch.py Sequence Mining - Class Association Rule - based forecast of Section 313 and relies only on patterns found from planetarium search of sky for angular separations learnt from HURDAT2 datasets and does not compute N-Body gravitational accelerations for these dates. Of particular significance are the dates 25/10/2022 and 8/11/2022 which are days of Solar and Lunar Eclipse Syzygies :

1342.1 This commit defines a new function verhulste_ricker_population_growth_model(population_at_t1,intrinsic_growth_rate,carrying_capacity,metropolitan_agglomeration) for Verhulste Population Growth Model within GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.py which is the Population Dynamics equivalent of Ricker Model (implemented in NeuronRain Grafit - course_material/Programming/R/code/Ricker.R) defined in terms of population at time t1, intrinsic growth rate of population and Carrying capacity (or sustainable population):
 	projected_population_at_t2 = population_at_t1 * math.exp(intrinsic_growth_rate*(1 - population_at_t1/carrying_capacity))
1342.2 Differential Equation for Verhulste Population Growth Model has been defined as:
	dN/dt = rN(1 - N/K) 
	where N is the population size,
	r is the intrinsic growth rate
	K is the carrying capacity of the local environment, and
	dN/dt, the derivative of N with respect to time t, is the rate of change in population with time.
1342.3 Population Projection is computed based on SEDAC PopEst 3 population data 2020 for 5904 square km Chennai Metropolitan Area post-expansion:
    	verhulste_ricker_population_growth_model(14730872,2.39,30000000,"Chennai Metropolitan Area Population")
for 2020 approximate population N=1,47,30,872, intrinsic growth rate r = 2.39% annual, carrying capacity K = 30 million inhabitants (tentative)
1342.4 From testlogs/GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.log.26October2022:
	verhulste_ricker_population_growth_model(): projected Chennai Metropolitan Area Population =  49718940.56063712

1342.8 Overpopulation and urban sustainable development—population carrying capacity in Shanghai based on probability-satisfaction evaluation method - https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/7281019 - "... Several important findings are derived: First, there is a general pattern that the urban population carrying capacity increases as the probability-satisfaction level decreases; second, the sensitive degrees of the population carrying capacity of different constraining factors vary. The sensitive degrees of the city’s GDP, fiscal revenues and paved road areas are lower than those of other constraining factors; third, currently the number of medical practitioners, the paved road areas and the volume of waste emission are the three most important constraining factors in Shanghai. Fourth, results of the multifactor analysis reveal that when the probability-satisfaction level is equal to the ideal level, the overall population carrying capacity of Shanghai is between 17.55 million and 23.52 million; when the probability-satisfaction level research the acceptable level, the overall population carrying capacity of Shanghai is between 20.35 million and 30.12 million people ..."

1343.1 Function verhulste_ricker_population_growth_model(population_at_t1,intrinsic_growth_rate,carrying_capacity,metropolitan_agglomeration,fromyear,toyear) has been enhanced to include range of years for population projection (fromyear to toyear) as arguments.
1343.2 New loop has been introduced to compute Verhulste Population Estimator YoY (Year on Year) assuming constant annual intrinsic growth rate and carrying capacity during fromyear to toyear which is quite a rigid constraint as carrying capacity might increase over the years by infrastructure development (for example if probability-satisfaction method of 1342.8 is applied) and intrinsic growth rate depends on infrastructure and opportunities.
    for y in range(1,number_of_years):
        projected_population_at_t2 = population_at_t1 * math.exp(intrinsic_growth_rate*(1 - population_at_t1/carrying_capacity))
        print("verhulste_ricker_population_growth_model(): projected " + metropolitan_agglomeration + " (year " + str(fromyear+y) + ") = ",projected_population_at_t2)
        population_at_t1 = projected_population_at_t2
1343.3 Two different Chennai Metropolitan Area population projection estimates have been derived for year ranges 2020-2050 and 2019-2050 by Verhulste Estimator based on 2 datasources: 
    1343.3.1 SEDAC Population Estimator v3 - Chennai Metropolitan Area Population Estimates 2020 - 14730872 - verhulste_ricker_population_growth_model(14730872,2.39/100.0,30000000,"Chennai Metropolitan Area Population",fromyear=2020,toyear=2050) - already computed in 1342 but annual intrinsic growth rate percentage 2.39 has been divided by 100.
    1343.3.2 Census of India 2011 statistics - Chennai Metropolitan Area Population Estimates 2011 - 15195379 - verhulste_ricker_population_growth_model(15195379,2.39/100.0,30000000,"Chennai Metropolitan Area Population",fromyear=2019,toyear=2050)
1343.4 Notion of intrinsic population growth rate in urban sprawls has uncanny resemblance to intrinsic fitness in social network analysis (ability of a social profile vertex to attract adjacent vertices or Merit counterpart of Fame)

(THEORY and FEATURE) MultiFractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA) - for unearthing Fractal structure within any timeseries data (including Music, Medical Imageing-ECG, Meteorology-Precipitation, Seismology-Tremors, NBody Gravitational Accelerations, Economics-Financial Markets) - 31 October 2022 - related to 690,691,692,1257,1315,1316,1327 and all sections on Music Information Retrieval(MIR), Climate analytics and Weather Forecast, Computational Economics-Quantitative Finance and TimeSeries Analysis, Graphical Event Models (GEM), Chaos and Fractals, Polynomial Interpolation

1348.1 This commit implements MultiFractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA) which oflate has been accepted as de-facto standard in analyzing and extracting fractal self-similarity within timeseries datasets across multiple fields - in python-src/MultiFractals.py
1348.2 Theory behind MultiFractals in a gist - quoted from https://mfdfa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions/index.html:
	"... MFDFA generates a fluctuation function F²(q,s), with s the segment size and q the q-powers, Take a timeseries Xₜ, find the integral Yₜ = cumsum(Xₜ), and segment the timeseries into Nₛ segments of size s.
	F^2(v,s)=1s∑i=1s[Y(v−1)s+i−yv,i]2, for v=1,2,…,Ns,
with yv,i the polynomial fittings of order m. Having obtained the variances of each (detrended) segment, average over s and increase s, to obtain the fluctuation function F2q(s) depending on the segment length.
	F^2q(s)={1Ns∑v=1/Ns[F2(v,s)]^q/2}^1/q
The fluctuation function F^2q(s) can now be plotted in a log-log scale, the slope of the fluctuation function F^2q(s) vs the s-segment size is the self-similarity scaling h(q) ..."
1348.3 In simple terms, timeseries is split into multiple segments,detrended by subtracting mean and each segment is fit to an order-n polynomial. Variances of the polynomials fit to each segment are computed and averaged by raising each variance to fractal exponents q/2 and finding 1/q root of their sum. 
1348.4 Every timeseries data used within NeuronRain - Music waveforms, Medical Imagery-Heartbeats, Weather and Seismic models of NBody gravitational acceleration timeseries for Hurricanes-Earthquakes, Stock quote tickers, Event Timeseries of GEM - could be brought under single umbrella of MFDFA models.
1348.5 Function stockquote_mfdfa_model() defined within MultiFractals.py imports Yahoo Finance python package (yfinance), obtains price history of a ticker symbol for a period and intervals, and fits the quotes data by MFDFA python package function:
	def stockquote_mfdfa_model(ticker,period='2y',interval='1wk',order=2):
		...
	    lag, dfa = MFDFA(timeseries, lag=lag, q=q_list, order=order)
		...
which takes timeseries, lag range of points, list of fractal exponents q and order of polynomial fit to each segment.
1348.6 Function stockquote_mfdfa_model() has been imported within Streaming_StockMarketData.py and Three ticker symbols TSLA,MSFT and AAPL belonging to IT sector have been fit to MFDFA model (2 year history and 1 week interval) and logs-plots (quite similar fluctuations) of the DFA data for each exponent q could be found in:

1349.1 python-src/image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.py has been updated to import OSMnx python library which optimizes and wraps OpenStreetMap Overpass API for retrieving road network topology for an urban sprawl. 
1349.2 Function urban_sprawl_road_network_OSM(cityname=None,latx=0,laty=0,longx=0,longy=0) accepts name of an urban area or longitude-latitude bounding box as parameters and internally invokes OpenStreetMap Overpass API wrappers of OSMnx to get road network graph as NetworkX MultiDiGraph object for those parameters.
1349.3 Nodes (locations) and Ways (roads) connecting the locations are printed along with the most important bottleneck measure of Betweenness Centrality for the road network graph. Betweenness Centrality is the ratio of number of shortest s-t paths passing through a vertex to total number of shortest paths between vertex s and t. Betweenness centrality is ideal metric for transportation networks in which every vertex is assigned a bottleneck centrality score compared to MaxFlow-Mincut (which is the minimum size set of edges when removed disconnect the graph). High betweenness vertices are more likely to be in minimum cut set and might carry major chunk of traffic as major fraction of shortest paths between pairs of localities pass through them. High betweenness vertices are potentially part of central business district as well since they could be part of arterial highways (thus delineating non-residential-commercial segments). 
1349.4 Road network graph for a tiny urban area (Kumbakonam,India) by name (graph_from_place()) and longitude-latitude bounding box (graph_from_bbox()) is computed from OpenStreetMap by OSMnx and has been plotted in python-src/image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/testlogs/GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.OSMnx.RoadNetwork.2November2022.jpeg (name) and testlogs/GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.OSMnx.RoadNetwork2.2November2022.jpeg (bounding box) :

1350. (THEORY and FEATURE) GIS Urban Sprawl Analytics - Urban Sprawl Road Network Analytics (OSMnx) based delineation for periurban sprawl of Chennai Metropolitan Area - a case study - 3 November 2022 - related to 823,1163,1164,1174,1175,1177,1179,1194,1211,1226,1234,1290,1291,1292,1295,1296,1297,1301,1304,1312,1313,1320,1323,1326,1328,1342,1343,1349 and all sections on GIS Urban Sprawl Analytics, Merit of Large Scale Visuals, Gridded Population Estimators (SEDAC GPW4 and GHSL convex hull estimators), DBSCAN and Neural Network Urban Extent Learners, Computational Geometry, Intrinsic Merit Rankings, R Ricker Population Estimation, Community detection, Social Network Analytics, Space filling by Curves, Unequal Circle and Polynomial packing, Computational Geometry and Polygonal packing by Voronoi Tessellation, Four color theorem, Economic Merit, Computational Economics - GDP estimation from Urban sprawl demographics, electricity consumption, Poverty alleviation, Preferential Attachment, Automatic Delineation of Urban Sprawls, Cellular Automata-SLEUTH-Polya Urn-Dynamic Facegraph Urban Growth Models, Drone Electronic Voting Machines, Drone Autonomous Delivery

1350.1 python-src/image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.py has been updated to add more parameters to urban_sprawl_road_network_OSM(cityname=None,latx=0,laty=0,longx=0,longy=0,address=None,radius=1000) for additional clauses to accept geocoded address and radius around the address in meters as parameters. 
1350.2 OSMnx graph_from_address() is invoked for the address and radius supplied to get the road network subgraph within cicle of radius around an address as a new clause:
        roadgraph = osmnx.graph.graph_from_address(address,dist=radius)
1350.3 Some very crucial statistics of the road network graph are printed by basic_stats() API of OSMnx which are precisely THE urban sprawl analytics showing various metrics of urban road network density. High road network density implies high urbanization and high built up surface by road gravity factor (1226.9). 
1350.4 Minimum weighted vertex cover (minimum weight set of vertices on which atleast one endpoint of every edge of the road network graph is incident) of the road network graph is printed by NetworkX min_weighted_vertex_cover() which in urban sprawl setting translates to the set of prime localities (which could constitute non-residential-commercial central business district) where road network is concentrated and are prone to traffic congestion.
1350.5 Strongly connected components of road network are listed which is a crucial analytics measure in delineating suburban areas where road connectivity is close-knit.
1350.6 Road graph Statistics earlier are computed by urban_sprawl_road_network_OSM() for following 6 contiguous periurban areas (circles of radius 3 km) outside periphery of Chennai Metropolitan Area (5904 sqkm) but are within 130 * 130 sqkm suburban commuting bounding box comparisons for GHSL R2022A BUILT datasets in Sections 1313 and 1320 which showed an abnormal class 21 pixel periurban growth between 2019 and 2022 (~2500 to 2700%):

1350.8 From road network density statistics in 1350.6 periurban regions [1350.6.2],[1350.6.4],[1350.6.5],[1350.6.6] are high ranked and stand out as dense periurban contiguous extensions of Chennai Metropolitan Area sprawl and contribute to suburban commute. Of six regions earlier [1350.6.5 - Ranipet] has highest road network density. 
1350.9 OSMnx graph_from_address() is quite helpful for Drone EVMs and Drone Autonomous Delivery - Drone, during its navigation, could compute road network subgraph for a pre-defined radius with intermedidate nodes as centroids on the fly and shortest paths within those subgraphs - a dynamic mission plan disassociated from ground control. For example goto_location() in concept Drone EVM implementation in https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/Grafit/blob/master/course_material/Programming/Python/code/Drone_MAVSDK_Client.py could be optimized by piecemeal approach earlier. This addresses memory efficiency concerns as entire road network graph need not be loaded in memory a priori.  It needs to be noted that union of shortest paths for subgraphs of road graph G centered around intermediate nodes ik (s,i1,i2,...,in,t - as drone flies from source(s) to destination(t)) may not be the same as shortest path between s-t within the graph G. 
1350.10 Average Circuity of road network computed by OSMnx is an important statistical measure of circuitous nature of a road (as against straightline connectivity) which has parallels to Lattice walks obstacle avoidance theory and prototype of Autonomous Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) in Section 1302. Lattice grids approximate circuity of road network carriageways by multiple 90-degree turn variant of Wiring problem (or multiple bend routes).

1351.4 OSMnx graphics have been changed for background,node and edge colors.

1351.5 Increased Road Densities imply high Road gravity factor and high built-up surface and volume (or) GHSL BUILT-V and BUILT-S datasets can be indirectly estimated from densities of road networks. Densities and Cheeger constants of Six Road networks in 1350 have been recomputed as below (from testlogs/GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.log.7November2022) for increased radius of 6 kilometres:

Let G be an undirected finite graph with vertex set V(G) and edge set E(G). For a collection of vertices A ⊆ V(G), let ∂A denote the collection of all edges going from a vertex in A to a vertex outside of A (sometimes called the edge boundary of A): h(G):=min {{|dA|}/{|A|}}\ : A subseteq V(G),0<|A| <= 0.5|V(G)|
The Cheeger constant is strictly positive if and only if G is a connected graph. Intuitively, if the Cheeger constant is small but positive, then there exists a "bottleneck", in the sense that there are two "large" sets of vertices with "few" links (edges) between them. The Cheeger constant is "large" if any possible division of the vertex set into two subsets has "many" links between those two subsets. ..."

An exception is the phenomenon of Conurbation in which a metropolitan area grows by set of non-contiguous urban sprawls separated by distance and develops as a single urban sprawl primarily because of travel patterns - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conurbation. Conurbation differs from Megalopolis which are caused by both labour markets and travels. Localities in case study earlier have been chosen along highways and as abutting contiguous extensions of the Chennai Metropolitan Area (CMA) where SEZs are located (and it still excludes road density of SEZ in northern fringes- Sricity-TADA in AP - which is also a contiguous extension of CMA thus making a multistate urban sprawl similar to Delhi-NCR)

1352.1 This commit resolves 2 JIRA issues :https://krishnairesearch.atlassian.net/browse/NEUR-11 and https://krishnairesearch.atlassian.net/browse/NEUR-12
1352.2 Function predict_EWE() in python-src/EphemerisSearch.py has been changed to correct the date formats of from and to date range for including time in hour:minute:seconds before passing on to JPL Horizons API as Julian Date object. 
1352.3 New function precipitation_mfdfa_model() has been defined in python-src/MultiFractals.py to accept precipitation (rainfall timeseries) history as argument and create an MFDFA model for it. Rainfall and Financial Market timeseries data are non-stationary (their mean and variance is not a constant but seasonal) and fluctuate seasonally depending on Monsoon and Global cues respectively. Usual timeseries analysis by ARMA, ARIMA are suited mostly to stationary timeseries which have predictably constant mean and variance while MFDFA is specific to non-stationary timeseries having varied mean and variance across segments(seasons). 
1352.4 GISWeatherAnalytics.py has been updated to redefine climate_analytics(datasource,date="",time="",predict_EWE_params=None,precipitation_timeseries=None) to accept paramaters for predict_EWE() as dictionary and rainfall timeseries as array. Rainfall timeseries is analyzed by precipitation_mfdfa_model() in MultiFractals.py through segments of order 2 polynomials. Clause of N-Body analytics has been updated to do sanity check on date and time and invoke predict_EWE() from EphemerisSearch.py
1352.5 climate_analytics() has been invoked for predicting Extreme Weather Events based on solar system Syzygies for a narrowed down angular separation search ranges for Venus-Mercury (10 degrees) and Sun-Moon (60 degrees) body pairs between 21 October 2022 - 15 December 2022:
    climate_analytics(datasource="n-body-analytics",predict_EWE_params={'datefrom':(2022,10,21,17,30,00),'dateto':(2022,12,15,17,30,00),'loc':'@0','bodypair':"Venus-Mercury",'angularsepbounds':('0d','10d')})
    climate_analytics(datasource="n-body-analytics",predict_EWE_params={'datefrom':(2022,10,21,17,30,00),'dateto':(2022,12,15,17,30,00),'loc':'@0','bodypair':"Sun-Moon",'angularsepbounds':('120d','180d')})
1352.6 An example timeseries of North East Monsoon Rainfall from https://mausam.imd.gov.in/chennai/mcdata/hydro.pdf has been modelled by MFDFA:
    nem_rainfall_timeseries=[2,1,3,1,4,2,1,8,21,10,6,4,8,16,9,14,8,6,10,16,5,2,1,1,1,1,3,4,2,4,14,18,10,10,5,8,2,4]
    climate_analytics(datasource="precipitation_MFDFA",precipitation_timeseries=nem_rainfall_timeseries)
Precipitation timeseries are unique which preserve annual rainfall average over many decades though short term day-to-day fluctuations are unpredictable implying an order in random data - dating of extreme weather events in medium range weather forecasting is feasible to some extent by projecting a precipitation timeseries based on known average. For example following timeseries for 17 cms rain over 4 days could be approximately projected to 10 days by a priori knowledge of average rainfall:
                2,3,10,2,day5,day6,day7,day8,day9,day10  = 50 cms (seasonal annual average for 10 days)
as 33 centimetres precipitation is highly likely over next 6 days possibly caused by extreme weather events. Average normal monsoon rainfall in India is revised every decade - https://www.financialexpress.com/lifestyle/science/imd-pegs-new-all-india-rainfall-normal-at-87-cm/2492190/ - "... The new all India annual rainfall normal, based on the 1971-2021 data, has been fixed at 1160.1 mm compared to the earlier normal of 1176.9 mm based on the 1961-2010 data. ...". In example above, probability of accurately predicting day5 + day6 + day7 + day8 + day9 + day10 rainfall distribution from average normal rainfall = 1/(number of 6-part restricted partitions of 33) = 1/restricted_6part_partition_number(33) without any assistance from weather model (ECMWF or GFS) non-linear chaotic equations of the form Aforecast =  Ainitial + F(A)∆t .
1352.7 Predictions from predict_EWE() and rainfall MFDFA model have been captured in following logs and images:
	image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/testlogs/GISWeatherAnalytics.log.9November2022

1353.1 python-src/music_pattern_mining/AudioToBitMatrix.py has been changed to implement new function generate_virtual_piano_notes(function="",length=10, genre="WesternClassical") which evaluates a mathematical function passed on as lambda string (by eval()) and maps each point value of function to a WesternClassical or Carnatic music piano 12-note octave symbol. Complex note patterns could be created by generate_virtual_piano_notes() through choice of appropriate mathematical functions. 
1353.2 music_synthesis() is invoked on virtual_piano_notes obtained from generate_virtual_piano_notes() for an example summation of damped sinusoids (in Fourier frequency domain notation):
	    music_synthesis(virtual_piano_notes=generate_virtual_piano_notes(function='(np.iinfo(np.int16).max*math.sin(2*3.1428*720*x) + np.iinfo(np.int16).max*math.sin(2*3.1428*1240*x) + np.iinfo(np.int16).max*math.sin(2*3.1428*2400*x) + np.iinfo(np.int16).max*math.sin(2*3.1428*4800*x))',length=300,genre="WesternClassical"),tempo=0.25)
1353.3 New function music_mfdfa_model(music,order=2,q=41,lagfrom=0.5,lagto=3,lagnum=100) has been defined within MultiFractals.py which loads a music file in librosa and analyzes the music waveform from it as a non-stationary timeseries by MFDFA - function has been parameterized by order of polynomial per segment, lag range and number of exponents(q). Music is non-stationary as mean and variance vary over time depending on notes, pitch and tempo.
1353.4 Following 3 music files belonging to different genres are analyzed by MFDFA:
    Synthesized by Virtual Piano - music_mfdfa_model("virtual_piano_music.wav",order=2)
    JSBach Sonata Flute EFlat - music_mfdfa_model("testlogs/Bach_Flute_Sonata_EFlat.mp4",order=2)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1355.1 python-src/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized.py has been updated to add a boolean parameter StartFromSquareRoot to SearchTiles_and_Factorize(n, k, Parallel_for="False", StartFromSquareRoot="False") for optionally choosing square root optimization (single CPU divmod-sqrt instruction) which begins binary searching for factors from square root of N to N along the rasterized hyperbolic arc tile segments instead of 1 to N.
1355.2 StartFromSquareRoot is passed on as commandline boolean flag to python-src/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized.py by sys.argv[6].
1355.3 python-src/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized_MultipleIntegers.py has been changed to import os and DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized modules. Commandline argument sys.argv[2] has been renamed as integerrange from increment.
1355.4 subprocess.call() within python-src/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized_MultipleIntegers.py has been replaced by os.system() for its simpler syntax - subprocess and os.system wrap respectively popen() and system() system calls. Direct invocation of DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized.SearchTiles_and_Factorize() is the obvious choice but Spark executors go erratic in cross-module invocation of a spark parallelized routine and since has been commented.

(THEORY and FEATURE) GIS Weather Analytics and Climate Analytics - 24 November 2022 - Prediction of Extreme Weather Events based on angular separations-NBody gravitational accelerations of solar system bodies from Sequence Mining - Graphics plot of Gravities - related to 148,172,313,445,446,463,1165,1171,1176,1266,1289,1316,1318,1327,1358 and all sections on Correlation between gravitational effects of Mined Celestial N-Body Patterns and terrestrial extreme weather events (or Gravitational effects on climate change), Drone natural obstacle avoidance, Drone autonomous online shopping delivery, Drone Electronic Voting Machine, Artificial Intelligence models for Climate Change, Astronomical algorithms, Multifractals, Timeseries analysis, Sequence Mining-Class Association Rules
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1359.1 python-src/EphemerisSearch.py has been changed to import SciPy L2 norm() and matplotlib plot() functions.
1359.2 Function predict_EWE(datefrom,dateto,loc,bodypair,angularsepbounds) has been changed to instantiate EphmerisSearch object and function extreme_weather_events_n_body_analytics() has been invoked to get details of the gravitational accelerations for every solar system body pair. Conjunctions of arbitrary number of solar system planets (some of the sequence mined rules contain 4 or 5 planets in HURDAT2 dataset example) could be searched by intersection of date ranges of pairwise angular separations. E.g Class association rule Sun+Moon+Mercury+Jupiter could be searched in Ephemeris by intersection of 30 degree angular separation dates for (1) Sun+Moon (2) Moon+Mercury (3) Mercury+Jupiter (4) Sun+Mercury (5) Sun+Jupiter (6) Moon+Jupiter (or) 4C2 = 4!/(2!2!) = 24/4 = 6 pairs.
1359.3 3D Gravitational acceleration vectors (x,y,z) computed for the pair of solar system bodies are plotted as L2 norms in matplotlib. From 1266.18 the vertical component z of the gravitational vectors is especially crucial as it could act on ocean surface and pull water vapor towards upper atmosphere by angular momentum decided by the aligning solar system bodies. As altitude of water vapor increases, pressure and temperature get lowered thus making a perfect recipe for storm surge (by Barometric Height Formula). 
1359.4 Function extreme_weather_events_n_body_analytics(self,datesofEWEs=None,loc="@earth-moon",angularsep=False,maxiterations=200) has been updated to change datatype of gravity vectors to dictionary of planet-gravity_vector from present arrays.
1359.5 python-src/image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/GISWeatherAnalytics.py has been updated invoke predict_EWE() for new date range 8 December 2022 to 27 December 2022 and 3 pairs Venus-Mercury,Mercury-Jupiter and Jupiter-Venus: 
    climate_analytics(datasource="n-body-analytics",predict_EWE_params={'datefrom':(2022,12,8,17,30,00),'dateto':(2022,12,27,17,30,00),'loc':'@0','bodypair':"Venus-Mercury",'angularsepbounds':('0d','30d')})

1359.6 Gravitational accelerations for 3 pairs have been plotted with legend in following JPG files and computations are in image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/testlogs/GISWeatherAnalytics.log.24November2022:
	image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/testlogs/GISWeatherAnalytics.Jupiter-Venus.Gravity.24November2022.jpg

	image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/testlogs/GISWeatherAnalytics.Venus-Mercury.Gravity.24November2022.jpg
1359.7 Gravity plots earlier show spike in pull of Mercury on Earth during the date range while Jupiter and Venus are static (abnormally high mercury gravity have been found earlier in Section 1271 and 1273). In theory, values of gravitational accelerations over ocean longitudes should peak (proportionately lowering pressure) during conjunctions of 2 or more solar system bodies and thus forming an one-to-one correspondence between Category of the storm and N-Body Gravity.

It is relevant to relate, that, the moon rises with a diurnal lag of 54 minutes and while at perigee takes around 5 hours to attain apparent zenith. Luni gravity makes the saturated clouds and neighbour hood atmospheric fluid mass significantly buoyant. This imparts additional dynamics as with monsoon drafts [14]. Thus, dense banks of moisture initially experience Brownian motion, congregate (centripetal), collate, ionize; form ionic boundaries; form corridors; gain velocity; become unidirectional (yet non-stratified); gain corollary momentum (primarily due to mass, which is looselarge, suspended over a rotating sphere along a near tangential line) in the direction of selenic transit; maintaining much higher rate of forward motion, more particularly when the moon is in perigee at syzygy. In the case of TCs in the northern hemisphere the following natural conditions act as additional upregulators (i) number of astral bodies that are aligned with the ecliptic (ii) thence the ecliptic being aligned with the latitude of system pass (iii) west-to-east geostrophic rotation ... Numerical model (software) may have to take the ephemeris data into account as well."

1361. (THEORY and FEATURE) GIS Weather Analytics and Climate Analytics - 29 November 2022 - Prediction of Extreme Weather Events based on angular separations-NBody gravitational accelerations of solar system bodies from Sequence Mining - Arbitrary Celestial Conjunctions and Reading Sequence mined Class Association Rules from JSON - related to 148,172,313,445,446,463,1165,1171,1176,1266,1289,1316,1318,1327,1358,1359,1360 and all sections on Correlation between gravitational effects of Mined Celestial N-Body Patterns and terrestrial extreme weather events (or Gravitational effects on climate change), Drone natural obstacle avoidance, Drone autonomous online shopping delivery, Drone Electronic Voting Machine, Artificial Intelligence models for Climate Change, Astronomical algorithms, Multifractals, Timeseries analysis, Sequence Mining-Class Association Rules,Computational Geometry on Riemannian Manifolds-Spacetime, ECMWF equations
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1361.1 GISWeatherAnalytics.py has been updated to change climate_analytics() to generalize celestial bodypairs to arbitrary celestial conjunctions by finding all possible pair combinations of a n-body conjunction to search in sky for a date range. Parameter "bodypair" has been changed to "bodyconjunctions" in predict_EWE_params and function itertools.combinations() has been invoked to compute all pairs of bodies on a tokenized "bodyconjunction" string parameter. 
1361.2 predict_EWE() is invoked on every pair of the body pair combination computed earlier. New function sequence_mining_CAR_search(carjsonfile,pEWEparams,support=10.0,maxiterations=5) has been defined to read HURDAT2 Sequence Mined Class Association Rule JSON file populated in Section 1360 by json module. Every rule in JSON file is sifted for Solar system bodies (for ignoring any other strings and intercuspal rules) and valid (intracuspal) rules which have frequencies above support are searched by climate_analytics() by setting "bodyconjunctions" dictionary parameter. Number of iterations are limited by maxiterations. 
1361.3 Functions sequence_mining_CAR_search() and climate_analytics() are called as below for new date range of 28 November 2022 to 8 December 2022 and angular separation of 30 degrees - First 5 valid rules in MinedClassAssociationRules.json are searched by sequence_mining_CAR_search() and 5 planetary conjunctions are searched by climate_analytics() :
    sequence_mining_CAR_search("../../MinedClassAssociationRules.json",pEWEparams={'datefrom':(2022,12,8,17,30,00),'dateto':(2022,12,27,17,30,00),'loc':'@0','angularsepbounds':('0d','30d')},maxiterations=5)
    climate_analytics(datasource="n-body-analytics",predict_EWE_params={'datefrom':(2022,11,28,17,30,00),'dateto':(2022,12,8,17,30,00),'loc':'@0','bodyconjunctions':"Venus-Sun-Mercury",'angularsepbounds':('0d','30d')})
    climate_analytics(datasource="n-body-analytics",predict_EWE_params={'datefrom':(2022,11,28,17,30,00),'dateto':(2022,12,8,17,30,00),'loc':'@0','bodyconjunctions':"Venus-Mercury",'angularsepbounds':('0d','30d')})
    climate_analytics(datasource="n-body-analytics",predict_EWE_params={'datefrom':(2022,11,28,17,30,00),'dateto':(2022,12,8,17,30,00),'loc':'@0','bodyconjunctions':"Mercury-Jupiter",'angularsepbounds':('0d','30d')})
    climate_analytics(datasource="n-body-analytics",predict_EWE_params={'datefrom':(2022,11,28,17,30,00),'dateto':(2022,12,8,17,30,00),'loc':'@0','bodyconjunctions':"Jupiter-Venus",'angularsepbounds':('0d','30d')})
    climate_analytics(datasource="n-body-analytics",predict_EWE_params={'datefrom':(2022,11,28,17,30,00),'dateto':(2022,12,8,17,30,00),'loc':'@0','bodyconjunctions':"Sun-Moon",'angularsepbounds':('0d','30d')})
1361.4 Earlier ephemeris search for arbitrary bodies in spacetime (which includes Deep Field galaxies and Stars) is a computational geometric range query and point location problem on 3-Dimensional spacetime for retrieving celestial bodies within a 3-D bounding box of longitude-latitude-altitude on a date range. Spacetime is a pseudo-Riemannian Manifold (or a differentiable topological space) and existing computational geometric algorithms are mostly limited to terrestrial contexts involving euclidean geometry. 
1361.5 Barometric height formula in 1359.10 which relates Pressure, Gravity, Temperature and Height and is the fundamental equation in ECMWF PDEs, has the unexpected implication for variable gravity in N-Body gravity climate model - As gravity increases in exponent of the formula, pressure exponentially decreases potentially causing severe low pressure troughs, a particularly important observation,implying even gravitational fluctuations due to distant solar system bodies (example: Pluto) can't be ignored as negligible.  
1361.6 It is hereby disclaimed that N-Body climate model is still in drawing boards and thus experimental verification of it is a necessity (though it is prima-facie evidenced by Sequence Mining of HURDAT2 hurricane datasets and a classic Indian astronomy treatise - Brihat Samhita) - Following are the logs and gravity plots for sequence mined rules and new dateranges earlier which again show notable peaking of Mercury's gravity, slight increase on Moon's gravity and drop in Mars' gravity from 28 November 2022 to 8 December 2022 of all the bodies which should theoretically affect Barometric pressure on Oceanic Earth though pinpointing the location is difficult at present as N-Body gravity computation is global and not localized due to vectors() JPL Horizons API limitation (Section 1327):

The years 1974,1988 and 1995 of weak northeast monsoon are having negative anomaly of SPD (Sealevel Pressure Difference). ... The SST(sea surface temperature) area averaged over the Pacific Ocean boxbounded by 160°E and 120°W longitudes and the latitudes of 5°S and 5°N is represented as 'NinoT'.Similarly the local SST in Bay of Bengal averaged over the area of box extend from 80°E to 90°E longitudes and 5°N to 15°N latitudes is represented as BayT. ... Conclusion: Most of the strong northeast monsoon years have positive anomaly in NinoT, BayT, DMI and SPD.Most of the weak northeast monsoon years show negative anomaly in the same. SRNM shows verystrong correlations with the supporting parameters such as NinoT and BayT. ..." - Climate change manifests in the form of erratic rainfall deviating from normal causing cloudbursts e.g 1 month of rainfall in 1 day which skews the future rainfall timeseries projection. But average normal seasonal rainfall is mostly abided by nature over a period of few decades implying short and medium range timeseries forecast (Section 1352.6) in the context of climate change might have to fit a multimodal Gaussian distribution (having mean equal to average annual normal rainfall) to future unknowns where high modes correspond to cloudbursts or unusually heavy rainfall within short span of time.

1362.1 python-src/image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.py has been updated to perform segmentation and density clustering (DBSCAN) on overlay imagery of GHSL R2022A BUILT-V (https://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/visualisation.php#lnlt=@13.05139,80.05875,10z&v=301&ln=0&gr=ds&lv=00000000000000000000000010000000000000011111&lo=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa&pg=V) and Chennai Metropolitan Area (testlogs/ChennaiMetropolitanAreaExpansion21October2022.jpeg) boundaries in the context of 2634% boom in periurban class 21 pixels found in Sections 1313,1320 and OSMNx Road Density rankings of periurban areas computed in 1350,1351. Overlay imagery is manually created from GIMP Layering tool by scaling and overlaying R2022A BUILT-V and testlogs/ChennaiMetropolitanAreaExpansion21October2022.jpeg after alpha channel coloring for opacity (transparency)
1362.2 DBSCAN clustering (neural network thresholding) and urban_sprawl_from_segments() are invoked for the overlay image to cluster the BUILT-V pixels in periurban regions of Chennai Metropolitan Area by density and segment by contours:
    #Chennai Metropolitan Area - GHSL R2022A BUILT-V overlay DBSCAN analysis

1362.3 DBSCAN clustering has been imported into GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.py. Matplotlib was slowing down heavily allocating huge anon pages for heap (few GBs) which required some optimizations - (*) Overlay image had lot of sea pixels which were curtailed (*) fast style is used in matplotlib (*) shapely speedups have been disabled due to following slowdown warning:
	/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/geopandas/_compat.py:115: UserWarning: The Shapely GEOS version (3.9.1-CAPI-1.14.2) is incompatible with the GEOS version PyGEOS was compiled with (3.10.1-CAPI-1.16.0). Conversions between both will be slow.
  shapely_geos_version, geos_capi_version_string
1362.4 python-src/image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/ImageGraph_Keras_Theano.py has been updated to do periodic garbage collection because of huge memory footprint.
1362.5 Functions image_segmentation_edge_detection(imagefile,plot="savefig"), contours_kmeans_clustering(imagefile,segment,number_of_clusters=3,maxiterations=3,plot="savefig"), image_segmentation_contours(imagefile1,plot="savefig") have been changed to choose between savefig() and show() in matlplotlib plots by parameter plot set to "savefig" or "show". The two functions have divergent codepaths and runtimes are different.
1362.6 Following are the affected logs,DOT file and images (Canny edge, kmeans, contour bounding circles, contour segments, watershed segments and DBSCAN neural network thresholding):

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1363.1 python-src/DBSCANClustering.py has been updated to introduce fraction of image as parameter to DBSCAN __init__() constructor. Image is sliced for the fraction specified before clustering.
1363.2 Neural network thresholding has been made similar to conventional thresholding and inequality has been reversed:
                         if evaledthreshold < threshold:
1363.3 Function clustering(self,maxclusters=100000,neuralnetwork=False) now accepts maximum number of clusters as additional argument for limiting the runtime while processing huge images.
1363.4 Two versions of find_neighbours() with and without neuralnetwork have been made into if-else clause depending on neuralnetwork flag. Erroneous remove() from seedpoints array have been commented (DBSCAN pseudocode from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN has been exactly adhered to)
1363.5 In write_clustered_image(self,neuralnetwork=False,fraction=1) clause for undefined cluster labels (-1) has been introduced which was missing until now.
1363.6 DBSCAN clustering densities for BUILT-V overlay has been computed as below and logged to testlogs/DBSCANClustering.log.2December2022:
    dbscan3=DBSCAN("image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/testlogs/ChennaiMetropolitanAreaExpansion21October2022_GHSLR2022A_BUILT-V-overlay.jpg")
    dbscan3.clustering()
    dbscan3.write_clustered_image(neuralnetwork=False)
1363.7 find_neighbours() function has been implemented at present as a square of side 2*epsilon which results in somewhat tiled clustering in ChennaiMetropolitanAreaExpansion21October2022_GHSLR2022A_BUILT-V-overlay_dbscanclustered.jpg . Circular neighbourhood of area Pi*epsilon*epsilon could cluster better but approximation of circular vicinity on 2-D array is non-trivial (which reduces to rasterization of a circle). Cluster statistics for this image are:
	number of DBSCAN density clusters: 15684
	size of image: 1272000

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1364.1 python-src/image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/GISWeatherAnalytics.py has been updated to comment unnecessary imports and import GaussianMixture Model from scikit-learn.
1364.2 Function climate_analytics(datasource,date="",time="",predict_EWE_params=None,precipitation_timeseries=None) has been updated to include a clause for new datasource "precipitation_GaussianMixture" which instantiates Scikit Learn Gaussian Mixture Model and fits precipitation timeseries to a multimodal Gaussian at present restricted to 2 modes (bimodal Gaussian or mixture of 2 unimodal Gaussians) - number of modes or components should infact be equal to number of peak dates in N-Body Gravitational accelerations that would perturb every ECMWF partial differential equation involving constant gravity (g) including Barometric Height Formula and Gravity Wave Drag-Buoyancy (which constitutes 30% of ECMWF supercomputer simulations) making it a variable. 
1364.3 GaussianMixture() object accepts 2D version of timeseries (ordered pairs of the form day-rainfall) and prints the means for each component of mixture model:
    climate_analytics(datasource="precipitation_GaussianMixture",precipitation_timeseries=nem_rainfall_timeseries)
1364.4 GMM computation is captured in testlogs/GISWeatherAnalytics.log.5December2022. Timeseries forecast example in Section 1352.6 and cloudbursts due to climate change in Section 1361.15 could be modelled by Gaussian Multimodal Mixture by setting means_init parameter to average normal seasonal rainfall and n_components parameter to number of peaks in N-Body gravity fluctuations computed by EphemerisSearch N-Body anaytics (for example from forecast made on 22 November 2022 - Section 1358 - Mercury's gravity on Earth peaks on two dates - 8 December 2022 and 27 December 2022 - which might potentially translate into a low pressure system).

1367. (THEORY and FEATURE) GIS Weather Analytics and Climate Analytics - 12 December 2022 - Prediction of Extreme Weather Events from Gaussian Mixture Model - Multimodal Gaussian fit of the precipitation timeseries - Modes set from N-Body gravitations - related to 148,172,313,445,446,463,1165,1171,1176,1266,1289,1316,1318,1327,1358,1359,1360,1361,1364 and all sections on Correlation between gravitational effects of Mined Celestial N-Body Patterns and terrestrial extreme weather events (or Gravitational effects on climate change), Drone natural obstacle avoidance-Drone autonomous online shopping delivery-Drone Electronic Voting Machine, Artificial Intelligence models for Climate Change, Astronomical algorithms, Multifractals, Timeseries analysis, Sequence Mining-Class Association Rules,Computational Geometry on Riemannian Manifolds-Spacetime, ECMWF equations
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1367.1 python-src/EphemerisSearch.py has been updated to return L2 norms of N-Body gravitational acceleration vectors as tuples in predict_EWE()
1367.2 python-src/image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/GISWeatherAnalytics.py has been updated to import find_peaks from scipy.signal
1367.3 Function climate_analytics(datasource,date="",time="",predict_EWE_params=None,precipitation_timeseries=None) has been updated to change the argument precipitation_timeseries to a dictionary of key-value pairs - "timeseries","forecast_timeseries" and "averageseasonalrainfall"
1367.4 Two timeseries supplied by user - for training and forecast - are zipped to 2D array of ordered pairs. 
1367.5 predict_EWE_params are now necessary from which N-Body conjunctions of solar system bodies (angular separation of 30 degrees) are obtained and for every pair of planets in the conjunction, predict_EWE() is invoked to get gravity L2 norms for the body pair.
1367.6 SciPy signal module has a dedicated method find_peaks() to infer the modes or peaks in a signal timeseries which is useful for wide range of disciplines (music, electrocardiogram and other medical imagery, stock market sensitive indices, commodity prices, graphical event models-GEM and CEM, telecom signals among others). Function find_peaks() is invoked on N-Body gravity L2 norm timeseries of the planetary pair for the required forecast daterange and a GaussianMixture model is fit for training timeseries (argument "timeseries") for n_components (modes) equal to peaks of training timeseries. This preprocessing gives means or average rainfall estimate for future GMMs.
1367.7 GaussianMixture models are then fit for forecast timeseries but for n_components (modes) equal to number of peaks of gravity L2 norms for a planet in the body pair and means_init equal to means computed for training timeseries in 1367.6. Fit GMMs are used to predict probability of a user supplied rainfall forecast timeseries (argument "forecast_timeseries"). Rationale is to fit a forecast GMM from past average rainfall history and correlate the peaks in future rainfall to peak N-Body gravity L2 norms which could be verified by the probability of a future precipitation timeseries - high probability implies correct forecast. Argument "averageseasonalrainfall" is at present used only for printing to logs but in future it could be used to plot the GMM forecast itself (sklearn.mixture.GaussianMixture - predict() and predict_proba() support only probability prediction of future timeseries points which is a forecast verfication and doesn't predict the future timeseries as such). Algorithm earlier is somewhat similar to Gaussian Ensemble Weather Forecast Models which choose the best fit from an ensemble of forecasts: 
                gmm_predict_body1_fit = GaussianMixture(n_components=no_of_modes_body1,random_state=0,means_init=gmm_fit.means_).fit(precipitation_timeseries_2D)
                gmm_predict_body1_predict = gmm_predict_body1_fit.predict_proba(precipitation_timeseries_forecast_2D)
                gmm_predict_body2_fit = GaussianMixture(n_components=no_of_modes_body2,random_state=0,means_init=gmm_fit.means_).fit(precipitation_timeseries_2D)
                gmm_predict_body2_predict = gmm_predict_body2_fit.predict_proba(precipitation_timeseries_forecast_2D)
                print("climate_analytics(): number of N-Body gravity peaks (modes of predicted GMM for average seasonal rainfall ",precipitation_timeseries['averageseasonalrainfall'],") for bodypair ",bp," for daterange ",predict_EWE_params['datefrom'],"-",predict_EWE_params['dateto'],":",(no_of_modes_body1,no_of_modes_body2)) 
                print("climate_analytics(): GMM probabilities of user supplied Forecast rainfall timeseries for bodypair ",bp," for daterange ",predict_EWE_params['datefrom'],"-",predict_EWE_params['dateto'],":",gmm_predict_body1_predict) 
                print("climate_analytics(): GMM probabilities of user supplied Forecast rainfall timeseries for bodypair ",bp," for daterange ",predict_EWE_params['datefrom'],"-",predict_EWE_params['dateto'],":",gmm_predict_body2_predict) 
1367.8 climate_analytics() is invoked for following 3 prominent body pairs - Mercury-Venus, Mercury-Jupiter and Sun-Moon - for user specified training timeseries and forecast timeseries on future date range 12 December 2022 to 31 December 2022 when Mercury's gravity again peaks around 27 December 2022 and probability of user supplied future rainfall timeseries is printed by GMM in image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/testlogs/GISWeatherAnalytics.log.12December2022 :

1367.10 PDEs and Equations of ECMWF or any other model involving constant gravity could be augmented by a function of N-Body gravity vectors of solar system that might increase the forecast accuracy, but the caveat is this kind of N-Body variable gravity augmentation is location and date specific and would exponentially blow-up the supercomputer simulations compared to constant gravity PDEs.
1367.11 NeuronRain Climate model goes beyond conventional wisdom of pollution induced climate vagaries and introduces variable gravity as an additional catalyst in determining weather. Going by similar line of reasoning gravitational effects on atmospheric carbon foot print and melting arctic-antartic ice sheets might need to be investigated in the context of global warming.

1368.1 python-src/image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/GISWeatherAnalytics.py has been updated to import integer partition functions from SymPy and norm from SciPy.
1368.2 New function gaussian_ensemble_forecast_rainfall_timeseries(predEWEparams=None,days=5,forecast_seasonal_rainfall=20,historic_training_timeseries=None,maxiterations=100) has been defined to implement Gaussian Ensemble Forecast model mentioned in 1367.7 based on integer partitions described in 1352.6 which accepts predict_EWE() dictionary parameters, number of days to forecast (defaults to 5 days), remaining rainfall to be received in the season (forecast_seasonal_rainfall), past historic training rainfall timeseries (historic_training_timeseries) and maximum number of integer partitions to enumerate.
1368.3 Basic algorithm implemented in a loop is to enumerate all restricted k-parts integer partitions (k=number of days forecast) of remaining rainfall to be received as candidate forecast rainfall timeseries (assuming nature sticks to average normal rainfall thumbrule for a seasonal non-stationary rainfall timeseries) and estimate Gaussian Mixture Model N-Body gravities in climate_analytics() for "forecast_timeseries" set to candidate timeseries partition and find the forecast timeseries which maximizes the N-Body gravity for any solar system bodypair - in other words, candidate timeseries are the elements of Gaussian Ensemble from which best fit forecast timeseries probability distribution is chosen corresponding to maximum GMM gravity L2 norm thus establishing a correlation between rainfall timeseries peaks and N-Body gravity peaks. Number of k-part partitions of remaining rainfall are available from functions partition() filtered by "days" of forecast which is equal to number of parts per candidate partition. Partitions are enumerated in lexicographic order by SymPy next_lex():
    if sum(candidate_partition_dict.values()) == days:
             gmm_gravity=climate_analytics(datasource="precipitation_GaussianMixture",predict_EWE_params=predEWEparams,precipitation_timeseries={"timeseries":historic_training_timeseries,"averageseasonalrainfall":forecast_seasonal_rainfall,'forecast_timeseries':candidate_partition_dict.values()})
	...

1368.4 Gaussian Ensemble 5-day forecast by N-Body gravity model (Mercury-Jupiter pair) for remaining season of North-East Monsoon and Cyclones over Bay of Bengal for date range 13/12/2022 to 31/12/2022 (which contains Mercury gravity peak on 27/12/2022) has been captured in logs testlogs/GISWeatherAnalytics.log.13December2022 by a fictitious forecast_seasonal_rainfall value of 10 and the most probable timeseries distribution of 10 over 5 days is found as [4,3,1,1,1]: 
	gaussian_ensemble_forecast_rainfall_timeseries(): Maximum probability rainfall timeseries =  [4, 3, 1, 1, 1]
1368.5 Timeseries candidates are printed as Ferrer histograms in testlogs/GISWeatherAnalytics.log.13December2022 as visual representation of rainfall forecasts. 
1368.6 Algorithm earlier is brute force and its complexity depends on partition number of an integer (remaining rainfall to be distributed over forecast days) which is computable in polynomial time by Hardy-Ramanujan-Rademacher formula.

Over long periods of time, the gravitational pull of other members of our solar system slowly change Earth’s spin, tilt, and orbit. ... Small changes in Earth’s spin, tilt, and orbit over these long periods of time can change the amount of sunlight received (and therefore absorbed and re-radiated) by different parts of the Earth. Over 10s to 100s of thousands of years, these small changes in the position of the Earth in relationship to the Sun can change the amount of solar radiation, also known as insolation, received by different parts of the Earth. In turn, changes in insolation over these long periods of time can change regional climates and the length and intensity of the seasons. The Earth’s spin, tilt, and orbit continue to change today, but do not explain the current rapid climate change. ..."
1368.14 Other Planets Influence Earth's Climate - [Jerry Mitrovica and Allessandro Forte - University Of Toronto] - Nature article - https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1997/12/971218090305.htm - "... We're showing for the first time that changes in the Earth's shape, when coupled with the gravitational effects from other planets, can produce large changes in the Earth's climate ... The evolution of the Earth's precession and obliquity are known to have a long-term impact on climate. Precession refers to the slow movement of the rotation axis in a 26,000-year cycle and obliquity, which varies with a 40,000-year cycle, refers to the tilt of the Earth's axis. As the precession and obliquity change, climate is directly affected because the pattern of the sunshine that falls on the Earth has been altered. ... Mitrovica has used numerical simulations to show that these aspects of the Earth's orbit have been affected by the gravitational attraction of Saturn and Jupiter ..."

1372.4 multiple-cado-nfs.py wraps around cado-nfs.py by backup of the logs,removes files from logs directory before proceeding to next integer and appends to existing logs - necessary because cado-nfs.py stalls in Square Root (a,b) files creation as logs folder is non-empty.   
1372.5 It needs to be observed that Spark-Python is a huge overhead in above numbers as heavy marshalling takes place between Spark Python + Py4J and Java in NeuronRain implementation which is absent in cado-nfs.py. CADO-NFS implements its own distributed computing framework (multiple IP address for servers, server threads for multicores) based on lightweight Clustering MPI C++ API (GMP) for parallelizing GNFS - IntelMPI, OpenMPI for Mellanox Infiniband,Intel Omni-Path - Refer cado-nfs source tree READMEs in cado-nfs/linalg/bwc/. It is also worth noting that mere parallelism was not enough to better GNFS in benchmarks so far - it also matters on what gets parallelized: CADO-NFS parallelizes linear algebra and sieving which themselves are broad search spaces involving lethargic polynomial selection while NeuronRain computational geometric factorization searches a narrow set of points on a hyperbolic arc (an affine Algebraic Variety over Galois Field or union of unions of intersections of Principal Ideals mentioned in Section 601) on rectified hyperbolic arc by parallel planar point location. Comparison above is not apples-to-apples exactly as factors found are different, software implementations are different and NeuronRain is at disadvantage as it is implemented for cloud computing and not for HPC clusters running performant C++ MPI cluster frameworks while CADO-NFS is HPC implementation. 
1372.6 CADO-NFS also requires setting the following additional config parameters in parameters/factor/params.c30 for logging:
tasks.workdir = multiple-cado-nfs-logs
tasks.name = multiple-cado-nfs

1373.1 NeuronRain computational geometric factorization has been benchmarked versus General Number Field Sieve (CADO-NFS) for 40 consecutive 236 bits integers from 90109209192120930920930920323828398923232323828382938928399283982983959 to 90109209192120930920930920323828398923232323828382938928399283982983999

1373.3 python-src/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized.py has been updated to introduce padding of tilesegments for elongating a rasterized hyperbolic arc line segment on either ends which ensures better search coverage along the hyperbolic curve (consecutive tilesegments overlap along the hyperbolic hillclimbing simulating a curved staircase):
	def tilesearch_nonpersistent(y, numfactors=maxfactors, padding=1)
1373.4 Interval midpoint computation has been further finetuned by Decimal() division instead of int(). Absolute function abs() has been replaced by bidirectional differences within inequality clauses. More factors_accum.add() calls have been added wherever necessary. Additional clauses for factor point location verification and square root point verification have been included in factorcandidate if-else.
1373.5 python-src/multiple-cado-nfs.py has been changed to add Special Number Field Sieve factorization CADO-NFS os.system() commandline as it involves special parameters file parameters.F9 which has to be manually edited and has since been commented.

1373.8 Similar to earlier CADO-NFS benchmarks above numbers are not fair as software platforms and languages are different and CADO-NFS is for HPC written in C++ and NeuronRain factorization is written for cloud mapreduce in Python+Java and better benchmarking could be obtained by replacing cloud MapReduce by MapReduce on MPI (MR-MPI) depending on feasibility.

1374.1 Multiple consecutive 97 bits integers in the range of 100000000000000000000000000000 to 100000000000000000000000000010 are factorized by GNFS (CADO-NFS) and NeuronRain computational geometric factorization. 
1374.2 python-src/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized.py has been updated to correct maximum factors if-else clause by stop()-ping the SparkSession and exit()-ing after maximum factors are found. 
1374.3 python-src/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized_MultipleIntegers.py has been updated to print nanoseconds timestamps before and after consecutive integer factorization. Number of factors which was hardcoded to 1 earlier was perhaps limiting the number of factors printed in 1373 which has been made a command line parameter resolving https://krishnairesearch.atlassian.net/browse/NEUR-19 though round off error in extreme cases may not be ruled out as rasterization used is naive and not Graphics grade. Check for maxfactors on Spark accumulator length is not global at present and local to executor instance (as Spark global state can't be broadcast from an instance though there are distributed caches - redis,memcache - might reflect the state globally) which might limit per instance factors and reduce step might print more factors than the maximum limit. Rasterization algorithm described for quadratic rational Beziers (a unifying concept of ellipse,hyperbola,parabola) in listing 13 of https://zingl.github.io/Bresenham.pdf for plotting hyperbola segmentwise could be a sophisticated alternative to naive rasterization implemented at present. Grobner bases are subsets of ideal I of a polynomial ring K[x1,x2,...,xn] which contain generating set of polynomials g1,g2,...,gm. Ideal I of polynomial ring K[x1,x2,...,xn] is a subset of K under addition and for all k in K and i in I, k*i in I. Grobner bases have been shown to generate any conical section by obtaining polynomial equation of quadratic rational Beziers and parameters of quadratic rational Beziers (Buchberger algorithm) determine whether the curve is hyperbola,ellipse or hyperbola.  
1374.4 JSON factors file read has been commented as redundant.
1374.5 Numbers head-to-head (not a fair comparison as platforms are HPC OpenMPI versus Cloud MapReduce) - Factors computed are different in CADO-NFS and NeuronRain - durations are almost same for CADO-NFS and NeuronRain as CADO-NFS is optimized for small integers and slows down in polynomial selection only for big integers above 200 bits:
----------------------------
1374.5.1 CADO-NFS - approximately 15.5 minutes - 9 97-bits integers - mostly prime factors - on an average ~1 minute per integer

In 1999, Ambainis [20], building on work of Buhrman and de Wolf [73] and Farhi, Goldstone, Gutmann, and Sipser [117], showed that for searching an ordered list, quantum computation can give no more than a constant factor improvement over the best possible classical algorithms..." - Amplitude amplification condition of QNC version of Computational Geometric Factorization in 562 requires the classical probability of complex amplitude Bi for a point on rectified hyperbola to be 1 satisfying the identity: (modulus(Bi))^2 = f(xi,yi)^2 + g(xi,yi)^2 = floor(1 - abs(xi*yi/N - 1)) which is 1 when xi*yi = N (factor points). From [Farhi-Goldstone-Gutmann-Sipser] result, quantum search may be only constant factor better than classical search for unstructured data. [Brasser-Hoyer-Tapp] derandomization of Grover search in Section 9.4 of 1373.11 by amplitude amplification implies Grover search version of Quantum Computational Geometric Factorization in 562 - by iterations of UV rotations till factor point (xi*yi=N) is found - is also derandomizable but search time is O(sqrt(N)) and cost of U,V rotations are prohibitive (O(N)) making derandomization of quantum factorization in 562 less attractive in the context of [Farhi-Goldstone-Gutmann-Sipser] constant factor speedup for unstructured list search - Set of points on rectified hyperbola rasterization is unstructured data apt for Grover search to locate factor point. 
1374.11 Practical applications of integer factorization - Cooley-Tukey Fast Fourier Transform algorithm - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooley%E2%80%93Tukey_FFT_algorithm - FFT algorithms depend on integer factorization and are of complexity O(NlogN). Fast factorization algorithms improve FFTs which are central to music synthesis, large scale visuals, large integer multiplications, telecom FDM (5G) among others - NC algorithm for FFTs could bring down runtime of O(NlogN) to O((logN)^k) and thus revolutionize any depending technologies.
1374.12 Lower Bounds for Quantum Search and Derandomization - [Harry Buhrman - Ronald de Wolf - CWI Amsterdam] - https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9811046.pdf - "... We prove lower bounds on the error probability of a quantum algorithm for searching through an unordered list of N items, as a function of the number T of queries it makes. In particular, if T ∈ O( √ N) then the error is lower bounded by a constant. If we want error ≤ 1/2^N then we need T ∈ Ω(N) queries. We apply this to show that a quantum computer cannot do much better than a classical computer when amplifying the success probability of an RP-machine. A classical computer can achieve error ≤ 1/2^k using k applications of the RP-machine, a quantum computer still needs at least ck applications for this (when treating the machine as a blackbox), where c > 0 is a constant independent of k. Furthermore, we prove a lower bound of Ω(√ log N / log log N) queries for quantum bounded-error search of an ordered list of N items. ..."
1374.13 Remarks on Quantum Modular Exponentiation and Some Experimental Demonstrations of Shor's Algorithm - https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6252v2 - "... An efficient quantum modular exponentiation method is indispensible for Shor's factoring algorithm. But we find that all descriptions presented by Shor, Nielsen and Chuang, Markov and Saeedi, et al., are flawed. We also remark that some experimental demonstrations of Shor's algorithm are misleading, because they violate the necessary condition that the selected number q=2s, where s is the number of qubits used in the first register, must satisfy n2≤q<2n2, where n is the large number to be factored. ..."

Null hypothesis: Timeseries Y does not cause Timeseries X. Timeseries Y Granger-causes Timeseries X if p-value if array of ordered pairs of two timeseries X and Y - (x1,y1),(x2,y2),(x3,y3),...,(xn,yn) - is more than a threshold rejecting Null hypothesis.

-------------------
1375.6 High p-value for TSLA and AAPL (~99%) implies AAPL Granger-causes TSLA (or causality between Apple and Tesla) and Low p-value for TSLA and MSFT (~15%) implies there is no Microsoft-Tesla causality. 
1375.7 Edges of a Graphical Event Model (GEM) or Causal Event Model (CEM) could be added dynamically based on pairwise Granger causality p-values of multiple event timeseries each of which is a vertex in GEM or CEM. For example, GEM for economic markets could be inferred by high Granger causality between timeseries for oil prices, commodity prices, automobile stocks, banking stocks (high vehicle loans), interest rates and inflation creating following causality edges between events: 
				Interest rates (adjusted to lower money circulation and inflation)
				     |
	Oil ----- Automobile ----- Banking ----- Inflation (high money circulation)
			|			   |
		  Commodity prices -----------------
1375.8 Similarly correlation between N-Body gravity timeseries of solar system and terrestrial extreme weather event timeseries could be Granger-caused (Granger causality is more of a forecast of one variable based on past values of another or deferred causality) and Music timeseries could be correlated for causal similarities.

1376.1 python-src/MultiFractals.py has been updated to import write_dot,matplotlib plot, networkx and graphviz.
1376.2 New multipurpose function granger_causality_GraphicalEventModel(dictoftimeseries,GEM_edge_probability_threshold=0.5,maxlag=3) has been defined to read a dictionary of event timeseries (map of event_name--to--event_timeseries) and iterate through the dictionary to infer top p-value (of 4 statistical tests) Granger causality edges between each pair of event timeseries in the dictionary.
1376.3 An edge is added to a NetworkX GEM DiGraph for the inferred causality direction if maximum p-value exceeds threshold (which is 50% by default or majority support). 
1376.4 GEM NetworkX graph is written to a DOT file testlogs/GrangerCausality_EventTimeseriesGraphicalEventModel.dot and read as GraphViz object for rendering it to a JPG file testlogs/GrangerCausality_EventTimeseriesGraphicalEventModel.gv.jpg.

(*) CADO-NFS GNFS factorization of same number had to be abandoned because of polynomial selection slowdown.

1379.3 This execution completes benchmark of all major factorization algorithm implementations - General Number Field Sieve(GNFS),Elliptic Curve Method(ECM),Pollard-Rho,Quadratic Sieve(QS),Flint,Mathematica,Pari-GP - versus NeuronRain computational geometric factorization though underlying platforms and languages are different and thus comparison may be unfair. Special Number Field Sieve (SNFS) factorization (meant for special form of integers) of Fermat Number F9 (2^2^9 + 1) was also tried and had to be abandoned because of polynomial selection slowdown in CADO-NFS. 
1379.4 Note: SIQS+ECM factorization was in the midst of factorizing 6th factor recursively before interruption at 25 minutes and NeuronRain factorization was interrupted after 1 minute after first pair was found. Individual times for 1st to 5th factors were not known for https://www.alpertron.com.ar/ECM.HTM SIQS+ECM which could be potentially on more sophisticated hardware (number of cores could be > 4).

Isochrones are standard urban planning metrics - more asymmetric the isochrones are more congestion prone is the urban sprawl - ideally isochrones have to be concentric circles for planned cities. Isochrones could be tools for commute based automatic delineation of urban sprawls.

1388.1 python-src/image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/GISWeatherAnalytics.py has been updated to analyze N-Body gravitational accelerations for few solar system body conjunctions in Sequence mined class association rules for Earthquakes and Hurricanes (Section 148 and Section 1358) from 31 January 2023 to 10 February 2023 which might be correlated. Three events occurred during this daterange: 1) An unseasonal depression over Bay of Bengal bringing heavy rainfall to east coast of Tamilnadu-India 2) A high intensity Turkiye-Syria earthquake (7.8 richter, Mercalli intensity 11 (maximum 12)) 3) Once in 50000 years Oort cloud Comet ZTF was closest to earth (and its gravity could be non-negligible being a long-tailed comet of few million kilometers) - Following are the n-body conjunctions analyzed for their gravitational effects - prominent among them are Venus-Sun-Mercury (a sequence mined rule and for their alleged role in heavy rainfall) and Sun-Mars(which is a sequence mined rule in few past earthquakes - Sendai 2011,Nepal and Chile 2015) :

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1395.1 Isochrone could be useful as flood mitigation tools - asymmetric,less concentric isochrone urban sprawls are more likely to be flood-prone by replacing vehicles by flood water (or) water is less likely to recede fast in asymmetric isochrones as storm water drains are mostly aligned along road networks. 
1395.2 Drive time radius for defining vehicular traffic isochrone convex hulls is replaced by Flow time radius (radial distance or ego graph convex hull inundated by flood water in a predefined time along road networks and larger the convex hull more flood-vulnerable the locality is) and dynamics of flood water can be explained by Navier-Stokes equation (Flow down an inclined plane - 2.5.3 - http://www.cbeaume.com/download/MATH3620_chap2.pdf) for fluid flow subject to predefined slope and flow velocity. 
1395.3 Flooding caused during natural calamities belong to the class of turbulent flows or unsteady-nonuniform flows which are more virulent and random than predictable laminar flows. Watershed segmentation algorithm in image segmentation is founded on similar principle (https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d3/db4/tutorial_py_watershed.html) - low-lying pixels in image (local minima or valleys) are filled by flooding till all local minima intersect to create barrier of shallow pixels or segments. Isochrone convex hull polygons could be inferred from Google Live Traffic ViteJS TypeScript implementation in Section 1387 (NeuronRain Grafit) by following algorithm:
   1395.3.1 Capture snapshot of Google live traffic in periodic intervals - every x minutes.
   1395.3.2 Create isochrone convex hull around busy marker points in 1395.3.1
   1395.3.3 Loop 1395.3.1 and 1395.3.2 for n number of iterations obtaining n concentric traffic isochrones for n*x minutes.
1395.4 Flood Detection is a SpaceNet 8 AI challenge - https://spacenet.ai/sn8-challenge/ - and Flood Isochrone Models are early warning solutions instead of detection after flooding. Navier-Stokes equations which are one of the Clay Mathematics Institute millennium problems have remained elusive to date as far as turbulent flows are concerned. Navier-Stokes equations relate rate of change of flow velocity of fluid, density of fluid,gravity and Cauchy stress tensor. Isochrone polygonal area covered by flood fluid is defined in terms of flow time radius computable from rate of change of flow velocity in Navier-Stokes equation. 
1395.5 There is subtle difference between vehicular traffic drive time radius isochrones and flow time radius flood isochrones - former is 2-dimensional as surface transport is 2-D and the latter is 3-dimensional in which area swept by flood waters depend also on depth of the terrain. Watershed segmentation is the obvious choice of flood modelling but the rider is how the valley pixels are filled by water to demarcate segment boundaries - conventional implementations of watershed algorithm most likely do not take into account simulation of Navier-Stokes turbulent flow (e.g OpenCV watershed() - https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/952962a111d533ec8de13c351a3d3e192ae6fc5d/modules/imgproc/src/segmentation.cpp). 
1395.6 Augmentation of Watershed algorithm pixel fill phase by Navier-Stokes flow velocity differential might be able to approximate how flooding unfolds on an urban sprawl road network and temporal checkpoint snapshots of isochrone polygons could be extracted from such a simulation quite similar to live traffic checkpointing algorithm in 1395.3. Depth relief data of terrain is a prerequisite for Navier-Stokes flow velocity but most GIS raster datasets are limited only to building height information of an urban sprawl. These factors warrant significant changes to conventional watershed algorithm implementations.

1397.1 python-src/image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.py has been updated to import Google Earth Engine Python (geemap,ee), Seaborn and Pandas libraries. 
1397.2 Code for this commit is based on Tutorial from Worldbank OpenNightLights GitHub - https://worldbank.github.io/OpenNightLights/tutorials/mod5_4_comparing_cities.html - for comparing urban areas by their Nighttime Lights radiance from Google Earth Engine VIIRS dataset. 
1397.3 Map functions GEE_city_average_radiance() and GEE_get_date() have been defined to gather radiance data and dates of the VIIRS imagery as per Google Earth Engine MapReduce functionality.
1397.4 New Function urban_sprawl_from_GEE(imagecollection,featurecollection,nightlightsparameter,cities) has been defined to authenticate and initialize Google Earth Engine (requires installation of Google Cloud SDK - https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference and Google Earth Engine Python API - https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/python_install)  
1397.5 Function urban_sprawl_from_GEE() authenticates and initializes a project "urbansprawlviirsanalytics" in https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome?project=urbansprawlviirsanalytics (pre-created manually in https://cloud.google.com). Array of Cities is searched in Google Earth Engine by ADM1_NAME (Global Administrative Unit Layer - GAUL - defined by UN FAO - https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/FAO_GAUL_2015_level1) for their average radiance and formatted to a Pandas dataframe datewise.
1397.6 VIIRS NightLights radiance data from 2014 till 2022 for 3 example cities are searched in Google Earth Engine VIIRS-DNB by urban_sprawl_from_GEE("NOAA/VIIRS/DNB/MONTHLY_V1/VCMSLCFG","FAO/GAUL/2015/level1","avg_rad",['Berlin','Seoul','Sao Paulo']) and plotted as timeseries. Through this nightlights are quantified numerically which were so far analyzed visually only through geometric clustering (k-means,DBSCAN,minimum enclosing circles,convex hulls). NightLight radiance could be substituted in data models as deemed necessary e.g GDP regression based on VIIRS radiance in Section 864.1.6 of https://neuronrain-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ relates GDP of a square bounding box and brightness variation of VIIRS NightLights.

1398.1 python-src/image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.py has been updated to import json for printing Google Earth Engine Radiance Feature collections.
1398.2 Function urban_sprawl_from_GEE(imagecollection,featurecollection,nightlightsparameter,cities=None,boundingbox=None,daterange=None) has been redefined to include Longitude-Latitude bounding box and date range of imagery as additional parameters for supporting user defined longitude-latitude bounding boxes of urban sprawls and dates filter. New if-else clause has been introduced to handle generic case of longitude-latitude bounding box geometry over Google earth engine imagery by filterBounds() on ee.Geometry.BBox() defined by boundingbox rectangle and EE image collection is filtered for the daterange parameter and usual GAUL city administrative name based VIIRS radiance (Section 1397) is handled in else. 
1398.3 Radiance mean values for a date range are accessed directly as JSON string, bypassing usual Featue collection API and iteratively appended to radiance array as urbansprawlBBaverageradiance["features"][n]["properties"]["mean"] by JSON dictionary dereferencing.

1405.6 Hardness of Natural Language Grammar and various TAG efforts - https://www.nltk.org/book/ch08.html - "..... So far, we have only considered "toy grammars," small grammars that illustrate the key aspects of parsing. But there is an obvious question as to whether the approach can be scaled up to cover large corpora of natural languages. How hard would it be to construct such a set of productions by hand? In general, the answer is: very hard. Even if we allow ourselves to use various formal devices that give much more succinct representations of grammar productions, it is still extremely difficult to keep control of the complex interactions between the many productions required to cover the major constructions of a language. In other words, it is hard to modularize grammars so that one portion can be developed independently of the other parts. This in turn means that it is difficult to distribute the task of grammar writing across a team of linguists. Another difficulty is that as the grammar expands to cover a wider and wider range of constructions, there is a corresponding increase in the number of analyses which are admitted for any one sentence. In other words, ambiguity increases with coverage.  Despite these problems, some large collaborative projects have achieved interesting and impressive results in developing rule-based grammars for several languages. Examples are the Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) Pargram project, the Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) LinGO Matrix framework, and the Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar XTAG Project. .....

Tamil is agglutinative.

Another example is verb conjugation. In all Dravidian languages, verbal markers are used to convey tense, person, and mood. For example, in Tamil, "சாப்பிடுகிறேன்" (cāppiṭukiṟēṉ, "I eat") is formed from the verb root சாப்பிடு- (cāppiṭu-, "to eat") + the present tense marker -கிற்- (-kiṟ-) + the first-person singular suffix -ஏன் (-ēṉ). ....."

1406.1 This commit implements a function opinion_mining() within new Python 3.x source file SocialNetworkAnalysis_OpinionMining.py for scraping Google News search results mostly from newspapers (print media) for a user query by GoogleNews Python API and aggregating the texts of the results by Newspaper3k library to get an approximate estimate of popular opinion on the queried topic. 
1406.2 Earlier function is an auxiliary tool to sample the psychological trend of population reported in media for a queried topic(sentiment polarity of the news article could be measured by various sentiment analyzers implemented in NeuronRain - MarkovRandomFields,RecursiveGlossOverlap_BeliefPropagation,SentiWordNet) and is most useful in Election analytics-Opinion surveys-Psephology. 
1406.3 Function opinion_mining() takes a query string, date range and maximum number of pages to scrape and invokes GoogleNews and Newspaper3k API and returns the results as Pandas DataFrame. An example query "Chennai Metropolitan Area" has been searched on Google News and newspaper articles have been aggregated as dataframe (detailed logs - testlogs/SocialNetworkAnalysis_OpinionMining.log.24March2023)
1406.4 This kind of opinion mining from streaming news feeds could serve as a representative sample of population, especially when size of electorate is huge and unknown, manual sampling is costly and some random sample has to be chosen for an opinion. GoogleNews aggregation implemented in this commit adds to Twitter-Facebook-PIPL-LinkedIn social media scrapers implemented few years ago (which often require developer accounts and API keys,get broken due to proprietary API changes,suffer from ratelimit and not suitable for largescale opinion mining)

1408.1 python-src/SocialNetworkAnalysis_OpinionMining.py has been updated to import VADER(Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning) Sentiment analyzer from NLTK and Empath sentiment analyzer.
1408.2 sentiment_analyzer() function has been updated to add clauses for 2 more sentiment analyzers - VADER and Empath - and implement a virtual opinion poll from sentiments of news articles returned for a user query. Set of news articles constitute the sample population and weighted numeric sentiment of the article computed by an ensemble of algorithms (RGO_Belief_Propagation,RGO_Belief_Propagation_MRF,TextBlob,SentiWordNet,VADER and Empath) is construed as vote of the article on the query. Sum of votes (numeric sentiments) from sample population (all news article) is the outcome of opinion poll. Traditional definition of a vote is usually unipolar binary (whether a voter chooses a candidate or not) while sentiment voting is tripolar (a voter has fractions of like,dislike and neutrality towards a candidate - lovehate). Neutral voters are theoretically indispensable - Some voting machines support "None of the above" button for neutrality or abstention. A Godelian design defect in democracy could be theoretically demonstrated by neutral voters who abstain from majority voting - Majority is effected by more than 50% votes and if more than 50% of an electorate abstains from an election definition of "Majority weilding power" is violated - Example: If 51 of 100 voters abstain and remaining 49 vote to elect a leader, resulting outcome is non-majoritarian (not voted for by more than 50 voters) whatever be the voting pattern of 49 who voted.  
1408.3 Earlier Google News based sentiment analysis could be extended to Google trends and Twitter trending hashtags. Function opinion_mining(query,fromdate,todate,maxpages=2,maxarticles=10,articlefraction=0.2) has been changed to add an argument articlefraction by which only a fractional summary of a big (TL;DR) article could be easily parsed for sentiments.
1408.4 News articles (population sample) for an example query "Stock market volatility" from 1 January 2023 to 1 March 2023 are sentiment analyzed and votes of the opinion poll are computed.
1408.5 Logs of virtual opinion poll are captured in testlogs/SocialNetworkAnalysis_OpinionMining.log.28March2023:

How] - Figure 2 - Hierarchy of the proposed planner. In the highest level, a decentralized planner assigns a TMA to each robot. Each TMA encompasses a specific task (e.g. picking up a package). Each TMA in turn is constructed as a set of local macro-actions (LMAs). Each LMA (the lower layer) is a feedback controller that acts as a funnel. LMAs funnel a large set of beliefs to a small set of beliefs (termination belief of the LMA) - "...... A Dec-POMDP [8] is a sequential decision-making problem where multiple agents (e.g., robots) operate under uncertainty based on different streams of observations. At each step, every agent chooses an action (in parallel) based purely on its local observations, resulting in an immediate reward and an observation for each individual agent based on stochastic (Markovian) models over continuous states, actions, and observation spaces..... Robots are classified into two categories: air vehicles (quadcopters) and ground vehicles (trucks). Air vehicles handle pickup of packages from bases, and can also deliver packages to two delivery locations, Dest1 and Dest2. ....." - Voting in Drone Electronic Voting Machines could be modelled as Partially Observable MDP by which multiple EVM drones (multirobots) fly to voter areas designated to them (task macro action assigned to each drone EVM) and operate under uncertainties.

Section 1165 describes a transportation graph masking and geodesic algorithm for choosing an obstacle avoiding route between source and destination. If number of waypoints in the geodesic between source and destination are N, in 3D cellular automata model drone could deviate in any of the 26 directions in each of N waypoints and has to be course-corrected.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1411.1 python-src/SocialNetworkAnalysis_OpinionMining.py has been updated to rectify computation of nett multipolar sentiment vote by subtracting negative polarity scores - every article is a voter on the candidate search query and multipolar vote (like-neutral-dislike) by an article is computed as positive-negative+objective sentiment scores from various algorithms.  
1411.2 Nett sentiment vote was earlier computed as positive+negative+objective which has been corrected to subtract negative sentiment. JIRA issue https://krishnairesearch.atlassian.net/browse/NEUR-22 has been raised for this error.
1411.3 Sentiment analyzer based multipolar vote envisages a fundamental change to conventional ballot besign where vote button against every candidate is of 3 columns (in percentage) - like %, neutrality %, dislike % (or) in quantum computation terms every vote is a superposed state of amp1<like| + amp2<neutral| + amp3<dislike| for respective complex amplitudes amp1,amp2 and amp3 and classical probabilities are obtained by Born's rule (classical probability = |complex amplitude|^2). Conventional boolean (bipolar) majority gate gets converted to ternary majority gate of leaves -1(dislike),0(neutral),+1(like) in complexity theoretic version of multipolar majority. Ternary majority gate discards 0(neutral) votes if they are less than 50% of total and calculates majority from -1(dislike) and +1(like) leaves. If number of 0(neutral) votes are > 50%, ternary majority gate fails with Godelian design defect(described in 1408.2). Thus boolean majority gate is a special case of ternary majority gate.
1411.4 New boolean flag UseNeuronRainSentimentAnalyzer has been introduced in opinion_mining() to optionally include votes from NeuronRain recursive gloss overlap textgraph sentiment analyzers based on sentiwordnet,belief propagation and markov random fields which are not normalized to 0 to 1 decimal fraction scale. By default UseNeuronRainSentimentAnalyzer is set to False and multipolar sentiment votes for news articles are based only on TextBlob,VADER,Empath with VADER being best suited for social media.

The difference between this common voting method and the Electoral College system is in fact stunning. The first person to determine a way to calculate the error for these voting methods was statistician W. F. Sheppard back in 1899. He determined that majority voting takes a noise rate of x to an error that’s approximately the square root of x. So under majority vote, if the voting machine flips votes with a probability of 1 in 10,000, the chance that the result of the election will be flipped is roughly the square root of that probability, or 1 in 100.  “With Electoral College voting, in essence you’re doing majority twice,” Mossel says. “First you do majority in each state and then you do the majority of the majority, so you take the square root of the square root. So you take square root of 1/10,000 once and get 1/100, and then you take square root again and get 1/10.” ....." - In essence depth-2 majority (traditional parliamentary democracy is an instance of depth-2 majority as electorate choose representatives in depth-1 and representatives choose head of state in depth-2 where "choice function" is contingent upon Axiom of Choice - AOC illustration by jars - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice#/media/File:Axiome_du_choix.png) is susceptible to high voting error by double square root of the error.

Query-Key-Value triples were hardcoded earlier within machine_translation() and now the transformers degree attention computation has been made essential part of Recursive Lambda Function Growth algorithm. JIRA issue https://krishnairesearch.atlassian.net/browse/NEUR-24 has been raised for this.

1413.5 Query-Key-Value matrices of word vertex degree attention are as equally important as dense subgraph document classifiers since degree attention is another spectacle to view subgraph core numbers (attention by a word vertex to another = incoming degree). Existing generative pretrained transformer models consider a text as one dimensional sequence of words while transformer degree attention makes it deeper by concentrating on degrees of textgraph obtained from flat text - in other words Generative AI meets formal languages and algorithmic graph theory. Tree adjoining grammar parse trees could be integrated into transformer degree attention model by recursively assigning an attention query-key-value to each auxiliary tree adjoined to an initial tree nonterminal. An example is described in 1413.7. 
1413.6 Following are updated text,DOT and logs for this update - textgraph obtained for updated RecursiveLambdaFunctionGrowth.txt shows Gross Domestic Product as prominent word vertex of high core number and degree attention (Query,Key,Value matrices):

1413.7 Fill-in-the-blanks word prediction by transformers - Example in 1285.17 - could be alternatively implemented in terms of textgraph degree attention (which is a deeper version of flat sequence model transformer attention) - Prediction of word "Committee" in masked sentence "CLS Judicial <--masked--> Annual Report" could be based upon Query-Key-Values learnt from degree attentions of textgraph word vertices of a larger contextual text containing "CLS Judicial ---- Annual Report". Word-Word pairwise QKV attentions for all pair shortest paths in textgraph of the context could assist in computing the argmax() for maximum likely word filling the blank by computing path degree attentions for each s-t word vertex pair as a function of individual vertex degree attentions (sum of attentions of all word vertices in a path is the simplest such function). If for instance the context text graph has following word-word paths of respective attention values captured in a hashmap - {Judicial....Court:1.22223, Judicial....Committee:2.331212, Judicial....Legal:1.001221,Committee....Annual:1.21214,Judicial....Annual:0.0000121 and so on} argmax() on either side of the blank returns Judicial....Committee and Committee....Annual implying "Committee" is the maximum likely word for the blank. Algorithm for Vowelless text (de)compression is similar (Section 2) - instead of blank words, one of the missing vowels a,e,i,o,u has to be predicted and restored by argmax(). Accuracy of this algorithm depends on context surrounding the blanks.Blank word prediction algorithm might also leverage data from linguistic studies  - Zipf-Mandelberot law,Markov K-Order Model,Shannon and Conditional Entropy (1288.6)

1416.1 ImageGraph_Keras_Theano.py has been updated to change kmeans cluster image drawing by choosing between 1) OpenCV2 drawContours() which is the obvious and 2) OpenCVs drawContours() with Convex Hull by a flag opencv2drawconvexhull. Existing pyplot code which was implemented to circumvent occassional drawContours() errors has been commented due to a sudden mysterious error that drew blank images (which was a working code so far). 
1416.2 Non-trivial changes were required to refactor above code which include defining a new inverted index contour2cluster mapping array_repr() string of each contour to its containing cluster. If opencv2drawconvexhull is False contours are drawn by drawContours() color coded by cluster id. If opencv2drawconvexhull is True all contours within a cluster are bounded by convex hulls showing a cluster boundary and drawn by drawContours() color coded by cluster_id.
1416.3 In addition, contours within a cluster are drawn by polylines() color coded by cluster_id instead of pyplot (which is a non-OpenCV paradigm)

1417.1 Updated python-src/image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/ImageGraph_Keras_Theano.py to introduce another boolean flag usepyplot to choose between pyplot and drawContours() in plotting the contour segmented imagery - There seems to be a problem recently in pyplot and contours are now plotted by drawContours() within image_segmentation_contours(imagefile1,plot="savefig") by default.
1417.2 Either pyplot savefig/show or cv2.imwrite() are invoked based on usepyplot flag to write xxxxx_contoursegmented.jpg (all contour polynomials are drawn).
1417.3 Return tuple of image_segmentation() has been expanded to include cannyedge detected edges.
    return (ret, img, markers, labels, stats, contourcentroids, facets, triangles, contours, facegraph, edges)
1417.4 An image containing Asokan Brahmi-Tamil Brahmi(Early and Later) inscription and Modern Tamil from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil-Brahmi has been segmented to compute contour polynomials and canny edges which is an algebraic alternative to ingest undeciphered and ancient scripts vis-a-vis contemporary representation of natural language by ASCII-Unicode. Every letter in an undeciphered inscription (e.g Indus-Sarasvati script) is a polynomial curve and storing undeciphered text as huge set of polynomials (equal to number of symbols in the inscription text) opens up possibilities of algebraic and topological analysis (including Voronoi-Delaunay diagrams) of writing systems (For example same symbol in two inscriptions are homeomorphic deformations):
    seg5=image_segmentation("testlogs/Tamil_brahmi.jpg",voronoi_delaunay=True)
1417.5 Tamil Brahmi and Ashoka Brahmi are derivatives of Brahmi (Tamil Brahmi predates Ashoka Brahmi) which in turn is suspected to be a descendant of Aramaic-Phoenician scripts. Image earlier from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil-Brahmi shows a topological similarity between Tamil Brahmi and Ashoka Brahmi scripts (Letters m and ma in Asokan and Tamil Brahmi having close resemblance are homeomorphic deformations). Polynomial representation of scripts is useful in text restoration - if an ancient text in damaged manuscript has only few fragments of a symbol,missing pieces can be interpolated by contour polynomials learnt from intact symbols in manuscript and accuracy depends on frequency of intact symbols (Section 2.16 - DeepMind Ithaca is 71% accurate in restoring 485 BC Greek text). But the limitation is the storage requirement for polynomials (could be millions, equal to number of symbols).

1418. (THEORY) Merit of Large Scale Visuals - Archaeology - Text Restoration by Product Homotopies of Script Contour Polynomials - 20 April 2023 - related to 2,345,714,1203,1232,1233,1236,1237,1240,1287,1288,1417 and all sections on Merit of Large Scale Visuals, Physique Recognition From Quadrilateral mesh isomorphism,Topological Face and Handwriting recognition, Archaeology-Topological Script Recognition, Product Homotopy, Homeomorphism and Topological Deformations, People Analytics, Computational Geometry, Graph Edit Distance and Earth mover distance, Graph Isomorphism (Exact, Approximate and Subgraph),Graph matching,Graph similarity,Image Search,Quadrilateral Mesh Deformation and Isomorphism,Maximum Common Subgraph Problem and Approximate Topological Matching,Text restoration,Polynomial Reconstruction Problem (PRP)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1418.1 Section 714 describes pattern grammars by product homotopies and pasting lemma for topological handwriting recognition: "..... Product of Path Homotopy classes: Two paths f and f' are homotopic if they have same initial and final points x0 and x1 and there is a continuous map F:I * I ---> X for some topology space X such that F(s,0) = f(s) and F(s,1) = f'(s); F(0,t) = x0 and F(1,t) = x1. If f is a path in X from x0 to x1 of homotopy F and g is a path from x1 to x2 of homotopy G, product homotopy F*G by pasting lemma is the set of all continuous paths from x0 to x2 via x1. .....". In other words path homotopies formalize the notion of continuously deforming the path between two endpoints by keeping endpoints fixed.
1418.2 Text restoration problem for an undeciphered writing system represented as set of contour polynomials (one polynomial per each symbol) could have following topological algorithm that approximately restores a damaged text:
	1418.2.1 Fragments of a damaged manuscript (papyrus or rock inscription) are segregated into damaged symbols and intact symbols
	1418.2.2 Intact symbols are contour segmented to get contour polynomials
	1418.2.3 Damaged symbols are piecewise discontinuous polynomials (have gaps in them due to damage) which need to be smoothed to a continuous polynomial by looking up a tabular map of intact_symbol-to-polynomial
	1418.2.4 Best matching intact symbol to the damaged symbol is found by ranking the percentage match of path homotopic deformation.
1418.3 Example damaged inscription of numbers "882213" of which only "8-2-13" is legible:
	 ------  ---	-------	 ----	|  -------
	 |    |  |	      |		|	 |
	 ------    --	-------	 ---	|  -------
	 |    |	    |	|        |	|	 |	
	 ------  ---	-------	 ------	|  -------
1418.4 Letters "8" in position 2 and "2" in position 4 are restored by above algorithm as:
	1418.4.1 Contour polynomials of each of the 6 symbols (intact and damaged) are found by OpenCV2 Chain approximation
	1418.4.2 Contour polynomial of a damaged symbol is matched against each contour polynomial of intact symbols by topological similarity percentage criterion (which could be any of: (1) Homeomorphism (special case of Homotopic equivalence) (2) Homotopic Equivalence ) and maximum matching intact symbol is deciphered for damaged symbol.
	1418.4.3 In above example damaged symbol in position 2 is approximately homotopically equivalent to intact symbol "8" in position 1 and damaged symbol in position 4 is approximately homotopically equivalent to intact symbol "2" in position 3. Percentage of approximate homotopic equivalence could be quantified by a topological distance (for example Directed Hausdorff distance).
	1418.4.4 Python frameworks - phcpy and PyBertini - find solutions to homotopies between two fixed endpoints.
1418.5 Earlier example could also be interpreted as Polynomial Reconstruction Problem in which all possible polynomials (continuous deformations) passing through maximum number of points (which are homotopy endpoints through which these deformations pass through) of damaged symbols are recovered by a python homotopy continuation library and only those which have closest topological similarity (directed Hausdorff distance) to intact symbols are chosen as deciphered symbols (Definition of Polynomial Reconstruction Problem: Given a set of n points (x1,y1),(x2,y2),...,(xn,yn) recover all polynomials p of degree less than k such that pi(xi) != yi for maximum of i points in {1,2,3,...,n}.)

To take an everyday example, the letters of the alphabet can be written either as unions of finitely many straight and curved line segments, or in thickened forms that are compact regions in the plane bounded by one or more simple closed curves. In each case the thin letter is a subspace of the thick letter, and we can continuously shrink the thick letter to the thin one. A nice way to do this is to decompose a thick letter, call it X, into line segments connecting each point on the outer boundary of X to a unique point of the thin subletter X, as indicated in the figure. Then we can shrink X to X by sliding each point of X − X into X along the line segment that contains it. Points that are already in X do not move .... In all these examples the structure that gives rise to the deformation retraction can be described by means of the following definition. For a map f : X→Y , the mapping cylinder Mf is the quotient space of the disjoint union (X×I) ∐ Y obtained by identifying each (x, 1) ∈ X×I with f (x) ∈ Y . In the letter examples, the space X is the outer boundary of the thick letter, Y is the thin letter, and f : X→Y sends the outer endpoint of each line segment to its inner endpoint. ....."

1419.13 Half orders of magnitude and Reversing Russian Peasant's multiplication tableau - https://www.cs.utep.edu/vladik/2007/tr07-09.pdf - Efficient guessing of right column integer in last row ending with 1 in left is useful for reversing Russian Peasant's multiplication tableau. By HPC Computational Geometric Factorization implementation in Rust, Russian Peasant multiplication tableau could be easily and trivially reversed in Nick's class (in O((logN)^k) time which is only polylogarithmically slower than the forward direction of O(logN) multiplication) by finding the factors themselves. For example product of two prime integers 113 and 19 (=2147) always has a unique tableau obtained by halving in left and multiplication by 2 in right as below which could be reversed without resorting to any already known factorization algorithms and computational geometric factorization by efficient guessing of last row (1 and 1216). An approximate lowerbound estimate of last row is (1, 2^(log(N)-1)) or (1,2^(log(2147)-1)) = (1,1073) and every integer between 1073 and 1216 of the structure prime * 2^p (1216 = 19 * 2^6) has to be verified by trial and error for factorization (which is subexponential thereby making reversal by computational geometric factorization better):
	113  19 + 
	56   38 
	28   76
	14   152
	7    304 + 
	3    608 +
	1   1216 +
	=> (Sum of right columns for odd left columns) 1216+608+304+19 = 2147  
Trivial reversal of earlier tableau by Computational Geometric Factorization could be optimized by exploiting the structure of last row-right column integer which is always of the form 2^k * prime for a semiprime (product of 2 primes) and factoring it instead of actual integer. In earlier example 1216 (which is close to lowerbound 2^(logN-1)) could be factorized into form 19 * 2^6 and table could be reverted bottom-to-top instead of factoring 2147.

1421.2 PHC executable can be installed from source in http://homepages.math.uic.edu/~jan/phcpy_doc_html/index.html or https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/jammy/+package/phcpack (Ubuntu apt binaries) 
1421.3 Example commandline "phc -p input output" computes homotopy continuation for set of 2 polynomials in file HomotopyContinuation/input: 
	 f(x,y)=x*y + 2*y^3 - 3.14E-01;
	 g(x,y)=3*(x + y)*x - 2/3;
and writes the solutions and output to HomotopyContinuation/solution and HomotopyContinuation/output by getting user choices through CLI questions. PHC logs are written to python-src/HomotopyContinuation/testlogs/HomotopyContinuation.log.1May2023 by choosing CLI option "2 : intermediate solutions at each step along the paths"
1421.4 Of all Homotopy continuation solutions available, PHC commandline is the simplest and could be useful to simulate homotopy (continuous deformation) of contour polynomials often obtained from images of human handwriting,human facial deformations,fingerprints for unique identification - every feature of human face,handwriting and fingerprint is defineable by a pattern grammar postulated in Sections 714 and 715 and every symbol of the pattern grammar is a contour homotopy. 
1421.5 Set of all continuous deformations or homotopy between f(x) and g(x) is parameterized by h(x, t) = (1 − t)f(x) + tg(x) for t in [0,1]. Functions f(x) and g(x) could be two contour polynomials from human face-handwriting-fingerprint or an archaeological inscription. 
1421.6 At present PHCPy has not been integrated as phc commandline utility is comprehensive and fast. Unique identification by face-fingerprint-handwriting could be implemented by (#) populating the 2 contour polynomials (from segmentation of two visuals to be compared) within HomotopyContinuation/input (one polynomial from each image) (#) finding the solution polynomials (#) rank the solutions by distance to get best match (lowest Directed Hausdorff distance)

1421.7 Definition of Homotopy - https://www.britannica.com/science/homotopy - ".....  Two paths with common endpoints are called homotopic if one can be continuously deformed into the other leaving the end points fixed and remaining within its defined region. ..... More formally, homotopy involves defining a path by mapping points in the interval from 0 to 1 to points in the region in a continuous manner—that is, so that neighbouring points on the interval correspond to neighbouring points on the path. A homotopy map h(x, t) is a continuous map that associates with two suitable paths, f(x) and g(x), a function of two variables x and t that is equal to f(x) when t = 0 and equal to g(x) when t = 1. The map corresponds to the intuitive idea of a gradual deformation without leaving the region as t changes from 0 to 1. For example, h(x, t) = (1 − t)f(x) + tg(x) is a homotopic function for paths f and g in part A of the figure; the points f(x) and g(x) are joined by a straight line segment, and for each fixed value of t, h(x, t) defines a path joining the same two endpoints. ......"

1422.1 PHCPy python interface of PHC has been integrated into HomotopyContinuation.py as separate function def phc_homotopy(start_system) which has been derived and modified from documentation example at http://homepages.math.uic.edu/~jan/phcpy_doc_html/pathtrack.html 
1422.2 Function phc_homotopy() accepts a start system of polynomials (p), whose solutions are connected to a target solutions system of polynomials (q) by a homotopy. Homotopy continuation or deformation is by tracking function initialize_standard_tracker() which connects p and q. Functions intialize_standard_solution() and next_standard_solution() keep track of each polynomial defined by increment parameter t. Source and target polynomial systems could be contour polynomials of large scale visual segmentation from 2 images to be matched.
1422.3 Homotopy continuation between p and q are drawn by matplotlib which simulates contour polynomial homotopy in : (1) the human handwriting deformations - same letter written by two individuals are connected by a homotopy continuation (as endpoints are always constant in letter polynomials and only the curves connecting the endpoints are deformed - defined by Product Homotopy shape grammar of 714 and 715) (2) facial deformations in face recognition (3) fingerprint recognition
1422.4 PHCpy has been compiled by target "make phcpy2c3.so" on PHCPack source tree which has been added to repository en masse due to the difficulty in getting a correct PHCPy build. Dependencies are enormous:
	1422.4.1 GCC version 7 and GNAT ADA GPL version 7 installed from respective sources - https://packages.debian.org/source/buster/gcc-7 and https://packages.debian.org/buster/gnat-7  
	1422.4.2 QD cloned and built with -fPIC flag for Quad double datatype - https://github.com/scibuilder/QD 
	1422.4.3 PHCPy target phcpy2c3.so built with -fPIC flag

To quote from the original paper, which was “an address delivered before the Princeton Meeting of the (American Mathematical) Society on November 2, 1946”, Whitehead states: In this presentation we abandon simplicial complexes in favor of cell complexes.

1422.7 Computational Complexity of PHC Homotopy Continuation - #P-Hard - http://homepages.math.uic.edu/~jan/phcpack_doc_html/welcome.html - "...... The computational complexity of this problem is #P-hard because of the exponential growth of the number of solutions as the number of input polynomials increases. For example, ten polynomials of degree two may intersect in 1,024 isolated points (that is two to the power ten). Twenty quadratic polynomials may lead to 1,048,576 solutions (that is 1,024 times 1,024). So it is not too difficult to write down small input sequences that lead to a huge output. ....." - Contour polynomials  for a large scale visual (from chain approximation contour segmentation) intersect to create the shape of an object within the image (including face,handwriting,fingerprint) and number of such intersections increase exponentially as features of objects get more complex. A hypothetical face recognition by homotopy continuation could be atleast #P-Hard by following similarity routine:
	1422.7.1 F(x) is the start system = intersection of all contour polynomials of image1 (could be thousands)
	1422.7.2 G(x) is the target system = intersection of all contour polynomials of image2 (could be thousands)
	1422.7.3 Homotopy h(x, t) = (1 − t)F(x) + tG(x) ,if exists, continuously deforms contours of image1 to contours of image2 (or morphs image1 to image2). Two visuals image1 and image2 are similar if and only of there exists a homotopy between F(x) and G(x) and computational complexity of finding such a homotopy is the measure of percentage similarity.

1422.9 Bottlenecks and Reach of an Algebraic Variety - https://www.juliahomotopycontinuation.org/examples/reach-curve/ - System of Contour Polynomials of an image define an algebraic variety (set of solutions of polynomials). Reach of a planar curve is determined by its bottlenecks and curvature and quantifies how close a curve is from self-intersecting. Reach is highly useful in handwriting and fingerprint recognition by comparing the distance between reach(s) of contour polynomials in two visuals.

1425.1 python-src/image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.py has been updated to include a dictionary of longitude-latitude to data of the raster at that long-lat and return the dictionary (longlatstat) within the return tuple value. This crucial functionality was lacking thus far and enables lookup of raster at longitude-latitude granularity. 
1425.2 New function four_colored_morphological_settelement_zones(heightrasterdata,longx,latx,longy,laty) has been defined which iterates through building height raster data (GHSL BUILT-C MSZ dataset is implied unless otherwise stated) and categorizes the pixels by their morphological settlement zone (MSZ) which are broadly classified into vegetation-water,residential and non-residential segments (and their subsegments by height and NDVI). By this four colored urban sprawl facegraph theory is minimally implemented in NeuronRain if non-residential segment is split into industrial and commercial zones by building heights (a filter based on height standards might have to be added - Industrial buildings (manufacturing) have a standard clearing height of 32-36 feet - https://methodarchitecture.com/industrial-clear-height-36/). Function four_colored_morphological_settlement_zones() is invoked on testlogs/RemoteSensingGIS/GHS_BUILT_C_MSZ_E2018_GLOBE_R2023A_54009_10_V1_0_R8_C26.tif GHSL BUILT-C R2023A morphological settlement zones dataset (downloadable from https://jeodpp.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ftp/jrc-opendata/GHSL/GHS_BUILT_C_GLOBE_R2023A/GHS_BUILT_C_MSZ_E2018_GLOBE_R2023A_54009_10/V1-0/tiles/ - 183 MB - not part of the commit):

1426.1 cpp-src/miscellaneous/pgood.cpp has been updated to include <cmath> headers and has been enhanced to implement a new function condorcet_jury_theorem() which computes asymptotic appoximation of CJT when p is very close to 0.5 or voters are epsilon-bias spaces. New flag iterative chooses either the binomial series iterative evaluation of CJT or asymptotic approximation of CJT from expression mentioned in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet%27s_jury_theorem#Asymptotics based on user input of voter size n,probability p and constants c2,c3,c4. 
1426.2 Condorcet Jury Theorem is central to lot of majority voting consensus related theory mentioned in NeuronRain design and is used as asymptotic derandomization gadget for BP* classes, particularly asymptotic derandomization of Shor BQP factorization by majority voting in section 1152 (https://neuronrain-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) in which every BPQ voter factorizes an integer with 67% accuracy and by CJT p-bias=0.67 making the group decision tend to 100% correctness asymptotically (Margulis Ruzzo Sharp Threshold).
1426.3 Some example asymptotic approximation of CJT for various population sizes and probabilities have been captured in cpp-src/miscellaneous/testlogs/pgood.log.18May2023

Bias is the difference between parity Bad or 0 (Overall bad group decision of a vote vector) and parity Good or 1 (Overall good group decision of a vote vector) - Small bias spaces fool parity - Earlier asymptotic approximation is for p closer to 0.5 (e.g 0.49999999) giving rise to voter sample space that is too close to call.

If a team of decision makers utilizes a simple majority rule, the decision would be perfectly correct in the limit given that the size of the team tends to infinity, even if the individual competencies, the pi’s, are different, provided that pi≥1⁄2+ε, where the value of ε is a positive constant regardless of how small it is ......Relying on the law of large numbers, Berend and Paroush (1998) found a necessary and sufficient condition for the validity of the third part of the statement, even in the case that competencies are not identical. The condition is: (An-1⁄2) √n →∞ , where An=∑pi ⁄ n.  The meaning of this condition is that if all pi > 1⁄2, the team's competence Π is still equal to one in the limit, even if the sequence of the pi ‘s decreases towards 1⁄2 but only in a "moderate pace" ....." - All voters (e.g BQP VoterSAT leaves of Majority gate) in earlier Asymptotic CJT Derandomization of BP* classes are identically competent (p=2/3) by definition of "Bounded Probabilistic". In heterogeneous setting, VoterSAT leaves of Majority gate (which could be a mix of all possible deterministic and probabilistic classes) should abide by earlier condition of individual competencies (pi's - error) for derandomization (or 100% perfect group decision) . Side-effect of heterogeneous CJT in Opinion Mining (Prediction analytics): Multiple opinion polls originating from disjoint or overlapping population samples of different sizes could be aggregated by CJT to get asymptotically 100% certain predictions if each individual poll is atleast 50% + epsilon right (pi's are >= 1/2+epsilon though not necessarily identical subject to Nitzan-Paroush condition).

The following two-part statement is attributed to Condorcet (1785): (1) A group of individuals who use the decision rule of simple majority is more likely than any single member of the group, to select the ``better'' of two alternatives when there exists uncertainty about which of the two alternatives is, in fact, preferred.  (2) The likelihood that the ``better'' of two alternatives is selected by simple majority rule becomes a complete certainty, if the number of voters, i.e., the number of group members would tend to infinity. One can refer to (1) as the nonasymptotic part of Condorcet's statement and to (2) as the asymptotic part ...... Proposition: Given a team of n members, where n is an odd number greater than 1, the members are competent in a sense that pi > 0.5 and vote independently, then the nonasymptotic part of Condorcet's statement is invalid if B1 > B2*B3*...*Bn where Bi = pi/(1-pi) .... Corollary: Consider a subgroup of k individuals (k is an odd number such that 1 < k <= n) taken as a random sample out of any team of n members whose competence structure is unknown. The probability that this sample of individuals would reach a correct decision while using a simple majority rule is higher than the competence of a single member sampled at random from the original team ......" - Earlier Proposition predicts when non-asymptotic part of Condorcet Jury Theorem would be falsified (or) when group decision would be worse than a random individual's decision for a heterogeneously competent electorate. In the context of derandomization gadget in section 1152, the VoterSATs (of any complexity class - deterministic or probabilistic) having competence(error) profile p1,p2,p3,...,pn feeding their boolean vote to the leaves of the majority gate must comply with earlier proposition. For BP* VoterSATs, error profile is always (0.67,0.67,0.67,...,0.67) and B1 = (2/3)/(1-2/3) = 2 < B2*B3*B4* ... = 2*2*2* .... *2 implying non-asymptotic part of CJT is not invalid and derandomization is perfect subject to [Nitzan-Paroush] asymptotic condition in 1426.11 (An = 2/3 and (An - 1/2)*sqrt(n) = (2/3 - 1/2)*sqrt(n) tends to infinity) . Corollary of the result proves the non-asymptotic part of CJT for any sampled subset of the electorate (or opinion mined samples do predict correctly even if competence of the sample is a black box).

Pseudodeterministic VoterSATs are suitable choices for CJT depth-2 majority gate (Majority+VoterSAT boolean composition) derandomization gadget in section 1152 by heterogeneously competent VoterSATs who decide with probabilities pi = 1/2 + epsilon almost close to 1 e.g Each VoterSAT evaluates to 1 if next integer pseudodeterministically predicted is a prime and 0 otherwise.
1426.14 Towards Group Learning: Distributed Weighting of Experts - [Abramovitz-Mattei] - https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10386119 - "...... In the literature on Condorcet Jury theorems and weighting experts, the inaccessibility of expert competences has been addressed in several ways. One is to use each expert’s frequency of agreement with the majority vote as a proxy for their competence, and to iteratively re-weigh them over time [3, 19, 33]. It has also been suggested to have the experts assess each other’s competences, treat this matrix as a Markov chain, and use its eigenvector values as the experts’ weights [17] in a manner reminiscent of PageRank [27] ......" - Accuracy of PageRank which is a peer-to-peer heterogeneous CJT voting mechanism, depends on competence profile of Voter URLs (or VoterSATs). Group decision by PageRank majority voting may not converge to 100% correctness if [Nitzan-Paroush] and [Yashar-Paroush] conditions for Jury error (competence) are violated.

Based on the results of the 16 presidential elections since World War II, the estimates for the basic model are as follows: PV = 47.3 + (.107*NETAPP) + (.541*Q2GDP) + (4.4*TERM1INC).  PV stands for the predicted share of the major party vote for the party of the incumbent president, NETAPP stands for the incumbent president’s net approval rating (approval – disapproval) in the final Gallup Poll in June, Q2GDP stands for the annualized growth rate of real GDP in the second quarter of the election year, and TERM1INC stands for the presence or absence of a first term incumbent in the race .....

1426.18 Proof of Margulis-Russo Sharp Threshold (which is the boolean function counterpart of Condorcet Jury Theorem) - https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~odonnell/boolean-analysis/lecture24.pdf - Theorem 1.1 - Every monotone graph property has a sharp threshold or derivative of expected value of a boolean function f with respect to p tends to a step function at infinitesimal interval (p,p+delta) - Majority voting with error (p-bias) could be formalized as a random graph in which each vertex x votes for vertex y (or there exists an edge x to y) with probability p. In the example of WWW random graph of URLs, there exists a p-bias for which PageRank has a sharp threshold.

1427.4 Earlier results simulate the conflict between intrinsic merit (Bing SPTAG search intent) versus majority voting (PageRank voting). Theoretically both rankings must have concurred attaining Fame-Merit equilibrium. New Partial Ordered Ranking could be evolved (section 626) by merging the two search results arrays which are totally ordered into a single POSET array of feature tuples (e.g ((pagerank1,sptag1),(pagerank2,sptag2),......) - some or all ordinates of feature tuples within the partial order may not be comparable by < relation.

(THEORY and FEATURE) Social network analysis and People analytics - Opinion Poll from arbitrary URL content specialized to capture twitter trends - 9 June 2023 - related to Section 588,1380,1406,1407,1408,1409,1410,1411 and all sections on Majority Voting, Approximate Majority,Election analytics-Psephology-Opinion polls,Reservoir Sampling,Topic detection and tracking,Social network analysis and People analytics from Twitter-Facebook-LinkedIn-PIPL streams, Large Scale Visuals-Analyzing Audio-Visuals for sentiment (Movies,YouTube) by LIWC-Empath, Drone Electronic Voting Machines-Multipolar voting 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1430.1 python-src/SocialNetworkAnalysis_OpinionMining.py has been updated to import BeautifulSoup4,requests and defaultdict. New function opinion_mining_from_url() has been defined that retrieves the text content of any URL by requests.get(), parses the HTML by BeautifulSoup4, and searches the content for Twitter trends to consolidate the data into a Twitter poll - number of tweets for each trending hashtag.
1430.2 Scraping by BeautifulSoup has been preferred to Twitter API (e.g Tweepy) as there is no auth token preprocessing required for accessing Twitter developer account and only the collective trends (voting) are captured. 
1430.3 Regular expressions for "Tweet" "Number of Tweets","Trending" etc., in https://twitter.com/i/trends format are parsed from URL text in a for loop and a Tweet dictionary ballot is populated as <HashTag>:<NumberOfTweets> [Every hashtag is considered a candidate and number of tweets for it the votes polled]
1430.4 Sentiment polarity of trending twitter hashtags are analyzed by VADER. Twitter trends from https://trendlistz.com/india are analyzed and twitter poll dictionary is populated from tweets.
1430.5 An example twitter trends is cast as ballot in testlogs/SocialNetworkAnalysis_OpinionMining.log.9June2023 for following trending twitter hashtags (BTS TakeTwo KPop dominates the trends):

1432.1 python-src/music_pattern_mining/AudioToBitMatrix.py has been updated to import rstr and re for random notes string generation based on Mersenne twister and regular expressions. 
1432.2 Function get_piano_frequencies(virtual_piano_notes,genre="WesternClassical") has been simplified for both "WesternClassical" and "Carnatic" notes generation and some of the processing have been moved out.
1432.3 Function music_synthesis(training_music=None,dur=5,samplerate=44100,polynomial_interpolation=True,polyfeatures=False,virtual_piano_notes=None,tempo=1,amplitude=4096,musicgenre="WesternClassical") has been updated to write separate synthesized WAV files for WesternClassical and Carnatic genres.
1432.4 Function generate_virtual_piano_notes(function="",randomnotesstringfrom=None,length=10, genre="WesternClassical") has been changed to include a new argument for randomnotesstringfrom apart from lambda functions, based on which an if clause has been introduced to synthesize notes for WesternClassical and Carnatic genres by rstr library by passing the notes of respective genres including notes subdivisions in both. String tokenizing and processing loop for # subdivision notes in WesternClassical and 1,2,3 subdivision notes in Carnatic has been newly implemented (requires special delimitation processings for # and 1,2,3 note suffixes). So far note subdivisions in both genres were not properly synthesized which is resolved by this rewrite. 
1432.5 There is a Ramsey theoretic aspect to Music notes sequence which could be a key to Music information retrieval and AI music synthesis - quoted from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Waerden%27s_theorem:  "..... Van der Waerden's theorem states that for any given positive integers r and k, there is some number N such that if the integers {1, 2, ..., N} are colored, each with one of r different colors, then there are at least k integers in arithmetic progression whose elements are of the same color. ...." - Music notes sequences are colored by 12-note octaves usually (r=12) and by Van Der Waerden Theorem there is a lurking arithmetic progression of length k within Music waveform of length N (or) notes at positions x,x+p,x+2p,....,x+kp of periodicity p within N-notes sequence are always the same implying predictability of even randomly synthesized music (or in automata terms the same note state is periodically traversed). The least such N is the Van Der Waerden number W(k,r) which has the present known upperbound of 2^2r^2^(k+9) or 12-notes music waveform has to be atleast W(k,12) long to exhibit arithmetic progression patterns.

1433.2 New function music_weighted_automaton_from_waveform(music_clip,duration=10) has been defined to integrate Music Weighted Automaton function music_weighted_automaton() into music analytics and synthesis (a standalone functionality so far) which enables learning automata from any music clip (user defined or AI synthesized).
1433.3 Scikit-Splearn Weighted Automaton learnt from NeuronRain synthesized WesternClassical piano notes sequence virtual_piano_music.WesternClassical.wav is written to MusicWeightedAutomaton.gv.pdf (logs: testlogs/AudioToBitMatrix.log.28June2023) 
1433.4 AI synthesis or Formal language synthesis of music from learnt music weighted automata, for example, could be through (*) Creating new automata by closure (union,intersection,complementation,Kleene-star,...) of already learnt music Weighted Automata corpus (*) Use of Pumping Lemma on learnt Weighted Automata which churn out arbitrary length music notes sequences based on learnt music.
1433.5 Music similarity or Music clustering in terms of Music Weighted Automata thus reduces to their equivalence and similarity of graph underneath the automata - music could be clustered by their weighted automata which is a computable regular language version of Kolmogorov complexity and compresses the dataset a la Normalized Compression Distance.

In the particular case where two sets of strings are given by unweighted automata, their edit-distance can be computed using the general algorithm of composition of weighted transducers combined with a singlesource shortest-paths algorithm. In the general case, we show that general weighted automata algorithms over the appropriate semirings can be used to compute the editdistance of two weighted automata exactly. These include classical algorithms such as the composition and ǫ-removal of weighted transducers and a new and simple synchronization algorithm for weighted transducers which, combined with ǫ-removal, can be used to normalize weighted transducers with bounded delays ....." - Definition 4: Edit distance of 2 weighted automata - "...... There exists a general algorithm for computing the edit-distance of two sets of strings given by two (unweighted) finite automata based on the composition of weighted transducers combined with a single-source shortest-paths algorithm [32].  Its complexity is O(|A1| |A2|) where |A1| and |A2| are the sizes of the input automata A1 and A2. ...... Definition 6: Let A1 and A2 be two acyclic weighted automata over the probability semiring and let PA1 and PA2 be the probability laws they define. The edit-distance of A1 and A2 is denoted by d(A1, A2) and defined by: d(A1, A2) = Sumover(x,y)[PA1(x)*PA2(y)*d(x, y)] ......" - Edit distance of Music Weighted Automata learnt earlier could be the music clustering metric based on which similar music playlists could be recommended. Collaborative filtering is majority voting dependent while music automata clustering is intrinsic and absolute. It is worth investigating if playlist recommendations by music automata edit distance clustering concur with Collaborative filtering majority vote recommendations (a Fame-Merit coincidence).

The DOT and GV files are now prefixed by the name of the music clip as unique identifies. DOT strings from 3 Music Automata are written to following DOT files:
	python-src/music_pattern_mining/testlogs/054-SBC-Aanandhamridhakarshini.mp4_MusicWeightedAutomaton.dot
	python-src/music_pattern_mining/testlogs/Bach_Flute_Sonata_EFlat.mp4_MusicWeightedAutomaton.dot
	python-src/music_pattern_mining/testlogs/JSBach_Musicological_Offering.mp4_MusicWeightedAutomaton.dot
1434.6 Mined Frequent subgraphs of the three music waveforms can be found in python-src/music_pattern_mining/testlogs/AudioToBitMatrix.log.3July2023. It has to be noted that threshold value has to be suitably chosen to filter unnecessary transitions. In above 3 examples,weighted automata are structurally similar implying common underlying theme of any music but the weights of some of the transitions differ as could be gleaned from 3 visualizations (most transitions are of 0 weight and have to be discarded). GSpan Graph mining implementation in NeuronRain at present does not give importance to weights of the edges.     
1434.7 Music datasets having high number of frequent subgraphs amongst their weighted automata representation could belong to similar music genre cluster and thus could be recommended as a playlist. The fact that Weighted Automata are already used for image compression, makes it easier to represent both audio-music and visuals (AV) as single combined weighted automata entity.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1435.1 python-src/music_pattern_mining/AudioToBitMatrix.py has been updated to import networkx shortest_path() function which at present is limited only to printing all shortest paths.
1435.2 Function def notes_to_audio(automaton=False, function=None, deterministic=True, samplerate=44100, fractal=True, periodicity=500, weightedautomatadotfile=None,state2notedict=None,genre="WesternClassical") has been updated to include 3 new arguments namely Music Weighted Finite Automaton (WFA) graph DOT file, a dictionary defined by user which maps states of the Music WFA to 12-octave Western classical or 16-octave Carnatic piano notes scale and genre of the music to be synthesized.
1435.3 New clause has been added to read the music WFA dot file by pydot,instantiate a DiGraph() from WFA dot file and do random walk on the directed graph of WFA by lookup of state2notedict defined by user which churns out a semi-random notes sequence abiding by the automata transitions obtained by successors() function. This random walk on music WFA synthesizes new variants of a base music by randomly choosing one of the successors (which makes it an NFA) in each transition and appending a note to the synthesized notes sequence by state2notesdict lookup(s) for that state transition. The WFA music dot file could either be from machine learnt scikit-splearn Hankel matrix WFA learning algorithm or a user supplied one. 
1435.4 Notes synthesized by earlier algorithm is passed on to music_synthesis() to compose a piano music waveform. This complements already implemented NotesStateMachine.txt automaton synthesis which is a user supplied finite automaton and not a machine learnt WFA. 
1435.5 Fundamental objective of this code change is to complete the two way translation: 1) Music waveform to WFA by scikit-splearn and 2) WFA to Music waveform by random walks on learnt WFA directed graph. Weighted Automata have been shown to be theoretically equivalent to Second Order Recurrent Neural Networks(RNN) and RNNs are known to be Turing-complete (they can compute any mathematical function). 
1435.6 2 DOT files for WFA learnt from 2 music waveforms have been instantiated as DiGraphs and new music have been synthesized from the 2 music WFAs. Music synthesized from WFA has restricted randomness and can be termed "creative" as the language generated by WFA is a subset of all possible random sequences and depends on base music waveform from which WFA was learnt - in other words WFA random walks synthesize new elaborate variants of base music or expand base music. For example following two synthesized waveforms expand learnt WFA of testlogs/054-SBC-Aanandhamridhakarshini.mp4 (Carnatic instrumental) and python-src/music_pattern_mining/testlogs/Bach_Flute_Sonata_EFlat.mp4 (Western Classical) respectively:
	python-src/music_pattern_mining/virtual_piano_music.Carnatic.wav
	python-src/music_pattern_mining/virtual_piano_music.WesternClassical.wav (especially impressive AI synthesis)
1435.7 Notes synthesized by random walks on 2 WFAs are written to python-src/music_pattern_mining/testlogs/AudioToBitMatrix.log.MusicSynthesizer.WFA.7July2023

(THEORY and FEATURE) Facebook Prophet model of timeseries data - Stock quotes usecase (extensible to any timeseries in Music, Medical Imageing-ECG, Meteorology-Precipitation, Seismology-Tremors, NBody Gravitational Accelerations, Economics-Financial Markets) - 11 July 2023 - related to 690,691,692,1257,1315,1316,1327,1348,1375,1376 and all sections on Music Information Retrieval(MIR), Climate analytics and Weather Forecast, Computational Economics-Quantitative Finance and TimeSeries Analysis, Graphical Event Models (GEM), Causal Event Models (CEM), Chain Event Graphs(CEG), Chaos and Fractals, EventNet causality, Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1436.1 python-src/Streaming_StockMarketData.py has been updated to import and invoke newly implemented Facebook Prophet model of stockquote timeseries within Streaming_TimeSeriesData.py
1436.2 python-src/Streaming_TimeSeriesData.py has been updated to import Pandas, Facebook Prophet, Yahoo Finance Python, NumPy, Pathlib and refactored function binary_encoded_fluctuations() from StringSearch_BinaryEncodedTimeSeries.py
1436.3 New function stockquote_Prophet_timeseries_forecast_model(ticker,period='2y',interval='1wk',algorithm="linear") in Streaming_TimeSeriesData.py implements the Facebook Prophet model (defaults to algorithm "linear") for Stock quote ticker timeseries datasets obtained from yfinance. The dataset is preprocessed by to_csv() and read_csv() to adhere to Prophet() functions. The dataset must have ds and y fields in Pandas DataFrame signifying dates and values and must be stripped off timezones.   
1436.4 Functions fit(),make_future_dataframe() and predict() respectively (*) fit the timeseries to a model (*) create a future dataframe placeholder and (*) makes predictions.
1436.5 Facebook Prophet timeseries model is summarized as: 
"...... y(t) = g(t) + s(t) + h(t) + e . (1) Here g(t) is the trend function which models non-periodic changes in the value of the time series, s(t) represents periodic changes (e.g., weekly and yearly seasonality), and h(t) represents the effects of holidays which occur on potentially irregular schedules over one or more days. The error term e represents any idiosyncratic changes which are not accommodated by the model; later we will make the parametric assumption that e is normally distributed ....." - quoted from https://peerj.com/preprints/3190.pdf
1436.6 Prophet introduces the changepoints paradigm which is conceptually similar to Binary Encoding of Fluctuations in a timeseries implemented in python-src/StringSearch_BinaryEncodedTimeSeries.py through which a timeseries data is flattened to a binary string of 0s (trend is downwards) and 1s (trend is upwards), a kind of semi de-trending of a real valued timeseries. Detection of changepoints in binary encoding of a timeseries is easier - for example "11111110" substring within binary flattening of stockquote timeseries implies consecutive bullish sessions followed by a dampening event in financial markets. Trend reversals usually are associated with monetary policy decisions, blackswan events, oil prices, wars, earning forecasts, global cues among others which could be vertices of a Graphical Event Model(GEM)-Causal Event Model(CEM) or Chain Event Graph(CEG). Thus change points could also be predicted from GEM-CEM-CEGs. Binary encoding of fluctuations also helps in finding fractal self-similarity (Chaos) in non-stationary and less predictable timeseries - Stock market behaves as a Multifractal (Fractal Market Hypothesis).  
1436.7 python-src/StringSearch_BinaryEncodedTimeSeries.py has been refactored and new function binary_encoded_fluctuations(ticker, period='2y', interval='1wk') has been defined encapsulating the binary-encoded changepoints of real valued stock quote ticker from yfinance. 
1436.8 This code works only with Prophet 1.1.1 and holidays 0.18 as there is a regression in recent Prophet version 1.1.4 causing optimization to fail - https://github.com/facebook/prophet/issues/2354
1436.9 Following is the example binary flattened encoding (from python-src/StringSearch_Pattern.txt) of AMZN stockquote ticker fluctuations:
	101000011100001011110010100001100101110000001011011011111100010011010010000001110110001011101101111111110
showing some prominent binary fluctuation changepoints (downward trend after a monochromatic streak of 4 or more upward trends) as follows (hyphenated) : 
	1010000111000010-11110-0101000011001011100000010110110-1111110-001001101001000000111011000101110110-1111111110-
1436.10 Stockquote data from yfinance is temporarily persisted to CSV file Streaming_TimeSeriesData.csv for Prophet preprocessing. File StringSearch_BinaryEncodedTimeSeries.py.2.7 has been backedup from 2to3 and autopep8 upgrade of StringSearch_BinaryEncodedTimeSeries.py. Logs for Prophet model forecast for AMZN ticker are captured in testlogs/Streaming_StockMarketData.Prophet.log.11July2023
1436.11 Earlier binary fluctuation model retrieves all locations of changepoints when a monochromatic streak of 0s or 1s (of length >= n) reverse to 1 or 0 which could be inputs to Prophet changepoints in R - https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/trend_changepoints.html - R code example: m <- prophet(df, changepoints = c('2014-01-01')). Length of monochromatic streaks of 0s and 1s determines the magnitude of the trend reversal (long streak of 1s followed by long streak of 0s shows a huge market bubble followed by crash while short streak reversals are less vulnerable). Earlier Prophet model of stockquotes could be suitably adapted to any timeseries - Music, Medical Imageing-ECG, Meteorology-Precipitation, Seismology-Tremors, NBody Gravitational Accelerations.

1437.2 python-src/Streaming_TimeSeriesData.py has been updated to import SuffixArray from StringSearch_LongestRepeatedSubstring.py and instantiate SuffixArray object for binary encoded fluctuations of a timeseries and find the longest repeated substring of 1s (up) and 0s (down) within it. SuffixArray of StringSearch_LongestRepeatedSubstring.py reads the binary fluctuations from python-src/StringSearch_Pattern.txt written by StringSearch_BinaryEncodedTimeSeries.py 
1437.3 python-src/StringSearch_LongestRepeatedSubstring.py has been upgraded to Python 3.x by 2to3 and autopep8 and updated to import python regular expressions (re). All occurrences of longest repeated fluctuation substring and their average periodicity are computed by re.finditer() (within longest_repeated_substring() method of SuffixArray class) which are the chronological locations of changepoints in binary fluctuations (or timepoints where stock quotes for a ticker had undergone exactly similar ebb and tide).

------------- Hurst exponent of the stockquote timeseries ------------
Hurst exponent H: 0.6631256237890952
Hurst constant c: 0.9515361975362864
------------- Hurst exponent of the stockquote timeseries ------------
Hurst exponent H: 0.5068001010178471
Hurst constant c: 1.3492060250154627

------------- Hurst exponent of the stockquote timeseries ------------
Hurst exponent H: 0.6609766057038647
Hurst constant c: 1.0363449457436713
1438.3 Hurst exponent (*) in the range 0-0.5 implies the timeseries is mean reverting in longterm (or high value is most likely followed by low value reverting to mean in longterm) (*) in the range 0.5-1 implies the time series is in momentum and trending (or high value is most likely followed by high value) and (*) equal to 0.5 implies the timeseries is a brownian motion random walk or typical unpredictable stock defined by Efficient Market Hypothesis. Values of H > 0.5 indicate a less volatile market.
1438.4 Hurst exponent H is related to Fractal dimension D as D = 2 - H and is a measure how turbulent or difficult to predict a timeseries is.Hurst exponent encodes the long term memory of a timeseries while Fractal dimension encodes its short term memory.
1438.5 Mean reverting stockquote timeseries especially have a parallel in precipitation timeseries of weather forecast modelled as Gaussian Ensemble in Section 1367 which fit the most probable precipitation timeseries from a Gaussian Mixture Model ensemble (set of timeseries daily rainfall partitions of same mean seasonal rainfall) having NBody gravity L2 norm peaks as modes.

1439.1 python-src/music_pattern_mining/AudioToBitMatrix.py has been updated to import MIT music21, hurst, pydub for composing a percussion accompaniment and mixing piano and percussion tracks to get a minimal concert audio synthesized by weighted automata which is equivalent of a 2-recurrent neural network. 
1439.2 Hurst exponent of synthesized note frequencies is computed by Python Hurst which is a measure of how random a music is - as music notes oscillate between fixed set of octave notes, Hurst exponent of music is very low implying mean reversion.  
1439.3 New function percussion_synthesis(virtual_piano_notes=None,percussion="TenorDrum",tempo=2000) has been defined to compose a percussion notes sequence from piano notes by MIT music21 library which offers rich set of music analysis features including neo-riemannian theory that embeds music on topological space (percussion instruments limited to 3 types of drums - SteelDrum,TenorDrum,BassDrum), set the tempo by music21 Metronome and obtain a percussion sequence of whole notes which are written to a MIDI file ./music21_percussion_for_piano.midi. This midi file can be viewed in musescore path for which is set in music21 environment. 
1439.4 MIDI file synthesized for percussion earlier is translated to a WAV file music21_percussion_for_piano.wav by FluidSynth commandline invoked in os.system() and played by playsound. Percussion synthesis requires installation of musescore, music21, pydub and FluidSynth. 
1439.5 Two threads are instantiated which respectively spawn executions of functions (1) music_synthesis() for piano track and (2) percussion_synthesis() for percussion track. These two tracks are overlay-ed by PyDub AudioSegment overlay to get a mixed track which is played as a concert.

1440.1 python-src/music_pattern_mining/AudioToBitMatrix.py has been updated to add an error condition to check length of notes sequence before Hurst exponent is computed (minimum length required is 100).
1440.2 Function percussion_synthesis(virtual_piano_notes=None,percussions=["Guitar","Trumpet","Violin","SteelDrum"],tempo=2000) has been enhanced to support an orchestra of multiple instruments including Violin,Guitar and Trumpet along with Drums in percussions parameter. Score object is instantiated in the beginning and notes composed for every instrument as Part object is inserted at 0.0 point in the Score. Score composed is written to MIDI file ./music21_percussion_for_piano.midi.   
1440.3 Function music_synthesis(training_music=None,dur=5,samplerate=44100,polynomial_interpolation=True,polyfeatures=False,virtual_piano_notes=None,tempo=1,amplitude=4096,musicgenre="WesternClassical",musicwfa_notes_weights=None) has been enhanced to include music WFA weights for notes (obtained from Music WFA) as additional argument. This parameter is for a future usage. 
1440.4 Function notes_to_audio(automaton=False, function=None, deterministic=True, samplerate=44100, fractal=True, periodicity=500, weightedautomatadotfile=None,state2notedict=None,genre="WesternClassical",wfaweight_threshold=0.0) has been updated to include WFA state transition weight threshold set to 0.0 by default.
1440.5 Till now the weights of WFA state transition were overlooked while computing successors which has been redressed by obtaining the weights of each of the successor and computing a probability distribution. In most cases the sum total of weights of successors is less than 1 which is hereby adjusted by extracting the zero weight successors for a state transition in WFA, and replacing the zero weight by allocating remaining probabilities equally as (1-sum_of_weights)/zeroelements 
1440.6 Next successor in WFA state machine is chosen non-deterministically by invoking numpy.random.choice() which has the facility to return elements according to a predefined probability distribution. This is the most important prerequisite to maximize the potential of WFA synthesizer: 
                 next_random_node_np=np.random.choice(successors,1,p=wfatransitionweights_np.tolist())
1440.7 Minutiae: An ndarray copy of WFA weights is required to circumvent the overwrite during probability distribution calculation earlier and NumPy str_ type has to be recast to Python str. 
1440.8 The mixed orchestra composition is written to new file music21_piano_with_percussions.mp3 and Score tracks are printed to testlogs/AudioToBitMatrix.log.MusicSynthesizer.Music21Fluidsynth.28July2023

This paper is an attempt to bridge the gap between deep learning and grammatical inference. Indeed, it provides an algorithm to extract a (stochastic) formal language from any recurrent neural network trained for language modelling. In detail, the algorithm uses the already trained network as an oracle—and thus does not require the access to the inner representation of the black-box—and applies a spectral approach to infer a weighted automaton. ......"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1442.1 Retrieving domain specific data for a unique person, especially opensource effort in the context of Information Technology domain, is quite necessary for quantifying absolute merit metrics for software effort estimation,talent analytics and automated recruitment which has been suggested as an alternative to conventional manual Q&A and interviews (Section 1204) often marred by theoretical limitations of sensitivity errors (Hardness of openended and multiple choice Question-Answering has been analyzed earlier and in Section 1394 in multiple theoretical formats - LTF,PTF,Switching Circuits,TQBFSAT,Halfplane intersections,Polynomial interpolation over reals,multiple choice CNFSAT,Query complexity model). 
1442.2 As it is infeasible to quantify the effort of an engineer exactly in IT domain because of proprietary closedsource products, estimation is limited to technical data in public domain only - opensource profiles, code contributions being some of them. Usual search engine results do not display indepth data about internals of a FOSS repository and code commits by a user. Code Search REST API in GitHub recently unveiled fill in this void through programmatic search queries to GitHub repositories and user code commits data.  
1442.3 python-src/SocialNetworkAnalysis_PeopleAnalytics.py has been updated to implement two new functions codesearch_statistics() and parse_sloc() for searching the GitHub repositories for statistics (code,repositories,commits,users) and source lines of code(SLOC) by CLOC utility matching a unique person identifier. These two metrics have been included in domain specific dictionary implemented in 1127. 
1442.4 Function codesearch_statistics(self,opensourceid,personalaccesstoken) makes four REST API calls by cURL to GitHub codesearch to get the search commits,repositories,users and code data matching a username (opensourceid). Stdout of the cURL are captured by os.popen().read() into a JSON string. Temporary credential PersonalAccessToken is passed on as additional argument: 
        codesearchjson=os.popen(" curl -L   -H \"Accept: application/vnd.github+json\"   -H \"Authorization: Bearer " + personalaccesstoken + "\"   -H \"X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28\"   \"https://api.github.com/search/users?q=" + opensourceid + "\" ").read()
        codesearchjson+=os.popen(" curl -L   -H \"Accept: application/vnd.github+json\"   -H \"Authorization: Bearer " + personalaccesstoken + "\"   -H \"X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28\"   \"https://api.github.com/search/code?q=" + opensourceid + "\" ").read()
        codesearchjson+=os.popen(" curl -L   -H \"Accept: application/vnd.github+json\"   -H \"Authorization: Bearer " + personalaccesstoken +"\"   -H \"X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28\"   \"https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=" + opensourceid + "\" ").read()
        codesearchjson+=os.popen(" curl -L   -H \"Accept: application/vnd.github+json\"   -H \"Authorization: Bearer " + personalaccesstoken + "\"  -H \"X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28\"   \"https://api.github.com/search/commits?q=" + opensourceid + "\" ").read()
1442.5 There is no direct GitHub CodeSearch REST API call available to compute SLOC of a repository though size of repository data can be retrieved. For SLOC metric, CLOC utility has to be pre-installed and invoked on a local repository clone. CLOC produces a detailed per language SLOC report of a repository. Function parse_sloc() reads a text file SocialNetworkAnalysis_PeopleAnalytics.OpenSource_SLOC containing the stdout of CLOC command (https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc) and returns the total Source Lines of Code in a repository. Kilo lines of Code is the most important variable in COCOMO (https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/COCOMO) effort estimation (in person-hours) which comes in 3 flavours - Basic, Intermediate and Detailed. Intermediate COCOMO is relevant for estimating effort involved in most medium size software products, given by formula - E = ai(KLoC)^bi(EAF). Example COCOMO estimation of NeuronRain AstroInfer repository - https://openhub.net/p/asfer-github-code/estimated_cost - COCOMO Coefficients used by OpenHub COCOMO are a=2.4 and b=1.05.
1442.6 EAF or Effort Adjustment Factor is a product of following attributes of a software product, each weighted between 0.9 to 1.4: 
-------------------------------
Product attributes: 
	Required software reliability extent
	Size of application database
	Complexity of the product

Hardware attributes:
	Run-time performance constraints
	Memory constraints

--------------------------------
1442.7 SLOC from CLOC utility and CodeSearch statistics from GitHub for a userid computed by parse_sloc() and codesearch_statistics() are populated in "opensource_sloc" and "opensource_codesearch_stats" fields of domain specific dictionary.

(THEORY and FEATURE) Software Analytics and Kernel Analytics - an STrace-LTrace shell script to machine-learn Filesystem prefetch patterns for readahead() system call - related to 1191,619,770,906,911,771,1192 and all sections on Program Analysis, AsFer-USBmd-VIRGO-KingCobra FTrace kernel callgraph analysis - Valgrind-Callgrind-KCacheGrind-Flamegraph userspace callgraph analysis, SATURN control flow analysis of VIRGO linux kernel, Software Analytics, Pandemic model of Botnet-Defense adversarial Game theoretic security, Cybercrime analytics, Anti-Malware,Anti-Ransomware,Anti-Theft and Anti-Plagiarism tools, KML, LAKE - 11 August 2023
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1443.1 Shell script "python-src/software_analytics/asfer_syscall_trace.sh <pid>" has been added to repository which invokes strace and ltrace system call trace utilities attaching to a process id specified in <pid> filtered by system call "read()".
1443.2 Output of strace and ltrace written to python-src/software_analytics/asfer_syscall_trace.log contains a chronological list of read() system calls on multiple file descriptors which could be parsed to get frequencies of reads for each file descriptor.
1443.3 Filesystem prefetch system call readahead() (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/readahead.2.html) prefetches a frequently read file descriptor and stores in pagecache. Filesystem prefetch is one of the most solved usecases in machine learning assisted linux kernel implementations - KML and LAKE.
1443.4 Filesystem Prefetch hints could be passed on to VIRGO linux kernel through NeuronRain Kernel Analytics which interfaces userspace machine learning and kernelspace cloud RPC through /etc/virgo_kernel_analytics.conf key-value pairs (exported as kernel wide variables by kernel_analytics VIRGO linux kernel module).
1443.5 For example, following is the file system read() pattern repeated by pulseaudio processid 2206 in asfer_syscall_trace.log for commandline "./asfer_syscall_trace.sh 2206" - file descriptors 22,3,48,20 are repetitively accessed which could be a kernel analytics key-value pair "frequently_read_filedescriptors=[22,3,48,20]" within /etc/virgo_kernel_analytics.conf read and published as a global variable within VIRGO linux kernel by driver virgo_kernel_analytics.ko. Based on this variable, VIRGO linux kernel could dynamically adjust to userspace filesystem read() activity:
	[pid  2206] read(22, "\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\0", 8) = 8
	[pid  2206] read(3, "W", 10)            = 1
	[pid  2206] read(3, 0x7fff4f2919ce, 10) = -1 EAGAIN (Resource temporarily unavailable)
	[pid  2206] read(22, "\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\0", 8) = 8
	[pid  2206] read(3, "W", 10)            = 1
	[pid  2206] read(3, 0x7fff4f2919ce, 10) = -1 EAGAIN (Resource temporarily unavailable)
	[pid  2206] read(48, "\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\0", 8) = 8
	[pid  2207] read(20, "\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\0", 8) = 8

Host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS) can automatically identify adversarial applications by learning models from system events that represent normal system behaviors. The system call is the only way for applications to interact with the operating system (OS). Thus, system call sequences are traditionally used in HIDS to train models to detect novel attacks, and a wide range of datasets has been proposed for this task. However, existing datasets are either built for user-level applications (not for OS kernels), or completely outdated (proposed more than 20 years ago). To address this issue, this paper presents the first large-scale dataset specifically assembled for anomaly detection of the Linux kernel......The raw dataset is 85 GB in size, and contains 18,966 system call sequences that are labeled with normal and abnormal attributes. Our dataset covers more than 200 kernel versions (including major/minor releases and revisions) and 3,600 bug-triggering programs in the past five years....." - Function ftrace_callgraph_dot() in python-src/software_analytics/CyclomaticComplexitySparkMapReducer.py creates a kernel function call sequence callgraph from DOT file which originate from userspace system call sequences. System call sequences are paths within holistic ftrace callgraph of an executable and anomalous code behaviour could be located by union and intersection of anomalous syscall sequence paths into call subgraphs (inferring subgraphs from union-intersection of paths is the converse of finding paths within a graph). Example: intersection of syscall sequences s1-s2-s3-s4-s5, s2-s3-s4-s7-s1, s1-s3-s4-s5-s7 is the call s3-s4 that could be HIDS hotspot.

1443.12 Intel microarchitecture - Branch prediction and Speculative execution - https://www.agner.org/optimize/microarchitecture.pdf - "..... The pipeline in a modern microprocessor contains many stages, including instruction fetch, decoding, register allocation and renaming, µop reordering, execution, and retirement.  Handling instructions in a pipelined manner allows the microprocessor to do many things at the same time. While one instruction is being executed, the next instructions are being fetched and decoded. The biggest problem with pipelining is branches in the code. For example, a conditional jump allows the instruction flow to go in any of two directions. If there is only one pipeline, then the microprocessor does not know which of the two branches to feed into the pipeline until the branch instruction has been executed. The longer the pipeline, the more time does the microprocessor waste if it does not know which branch to feed into the pipeline.  The microarchitecture tries to overcome this problem by feeding the most probable branch into the pipeline and execute it speculatively. Speculative execution means that the instructions are decoded and executed, but the results are not retired into the permanent register file, and memory writes are pending until the branch instruction is finally resolved. If it turns out that the guess was wrong and the wrong branch was executed speculatively, then the pipeline is flushed, the results of the speculative execution are discarded and the other branch is fed into the pipeline. This is called a branch misprediction, and the result is that several clock cycles are wasted. The number of wasted clock cycles is approximately equal to the length of the pipeline ......"

Let X be a set of items of size n , which may contain some defective items denoted by I, where I in X. In group testing, a test refers to a subset of items Q in X. The test outcome is 1 (positive) if Q contains at least one defective item, i.e., |Q intersection I| > 0 , and 0 (negative) otherwise.  We give a novel approach to obtaining tight lower bounds in non-adaptive randomized group testing. Employing this new method, we can prove the following result.  Any non-adaptive randomized algorithm that, for any set of defective items I, with probability at least 2/3 , returns an estimate of the number of defective items I  to within a constant factor requires at least Omega(logn) tests......" - system call sequence anomaly detection is a Byzantine fault tolearance (BFT) problem of finding defective sequences in a set of all possible system call sequences and theoretically approximate number of randomized testing queries (succeeding atleast 67%) required is logarithmic in total number of system call sequences.

Branch prediction mechanisms are becoming commonplace within modern microprocessors. For developers of real-time control systems, the mechanisms present predictability problems. The reasons are they increase the difficulty in analysing software for its Worst-Case Execution Time without introducing unmanageable pessimism and they increase the variability of the software’s execution times. In this paper, we improve upon existing branch prediction analysis by taking into account the semantic context of the branches in the source code in order to classify them as either being easy-to-predict or hard-to-predict. Based on this classification we provide a static analysis approach for bimodal and global-history branch prediction schemes......" - accurate dynamic branch prediction schemes are necessary to estimate deadlines of processes in Survival Index Worst Case Execution Time OS Scheduler - Section 751 - https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/Grafit/blob/master/course_material/NeuronRain/AdvancedComputerScienceAndMachineLearning/AdvancedComputerScienceAndMachineLearning.txt (related: Linux Kernel EDF SCHED_DEADLINE - https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/scheduler/sched-deadline.html)

1447.6 Following is an algorithmic outline on how above elevation data for vertices of a city road network could be used as a floodwater prediction tool:
	1447.6.1 Label every vertex (road intersection) of an OSMnx road network graph by its elevation 
	1447.6.2 Find all paths in the road network graph which have their vertex elevations as a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence.
	1447.6.3 For example, following road graph of 9 nodes with elevation labels (in meters) for each road intersection vertex:
		ele(v1) = 10
		ele(v2) = 15
		ele(v3) = 10
		ele(v4) = 20 
		ele(v5) = 10
		ele(v6) = 10
		ele(v7) = 8 
		ele(v8) = 5 
		ele(v9) = 12
has a highway v5-v6-v7-v8 of monotonically decreasing elevations [10,10,8,5] implying v8 is vulnerable to flooding from elevated v5,v6,v7 intersections. 
	1447.6.4 Highways of undulating elevations are another problem scenarios inhibiting flood water drain. Example: Highway v1-v2-v3-v4-v5 in above graph fluctuates in its grades as [10,15,10,20,10] 
	1447.6.5 Water and Drainage networks are aligned along edges of road graph. Theoretically all roads (paths) in OSMnx road network graph must be of monotonically increasing or decreasing gradient for easy flood drain (Per Edge Elevation attributes from osmnx.elevation.add_edge_grades(G, add_absolute=True, precision=None) and osmnx.elevation.add_node_elevations_google(G, api_key=None, max_locations_per_batch=350, pause=0, precision=None, url_template='https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/elevation/json?locations={}&key={}') which requires Google Elevations Premium API key - https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/internals-reference.html - are alternatives to OpenElevation REST API).

It measures the entropy of street bearings in weighted and unweighted network models, along with each city's typical street segment length, average circuity, average node degree, and the network's proportions of four-way intersections and dead-ends. It also develops a new indicator of orientation-order that quantifies how a city's street network follows the geometric ordering logic of a single grid. A cluster analysis is performed to explore similarities and differences among these study sites in multiple dimensions. Significant statistical relationships exist between city orientation-order and other indicators of spatial order, including street circuity and measures of connectedness. On average, US/Canadian study sites are far more grid-like than those elsewhere, exhibiting less entropy and circuity. ......" - Less entropy and circuity of a street and road network implies less congestion and might facilitate easy flood water draining.

1448.1 python-src/image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.py has been updated to define a new function that implements quadratic regression model (2) for functional urban area delineation (FUA) described in paper:  Metropolitan areas in the world - Delineation and population trends - [OECD-GHSL-JRC] - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119020300139 - ".....

1448.2 Function  functional_urban_area_delineation_GHSL_regression(b0,b1,b2,distij,g1,sizeij,p1,p2,populationj,w,gdp,epsilonij) interprets the parameters of the above regression as below:
    FUAij = b0 + b1*distij + b2*distij*distij + g1*sizeij + p1*populationj + p2*populationj*populationj + w*gdp + epsilonij
    print("b0 (bias):",b0)

    print("error term(epsilonij):",epsilonij)
    print("FUAij (can be converted to a boolean value for whether periurban cell i belongs to urban area j):",FUAij)
1448.3 Delineation function is invoked for parameters functional_urban_area_delineation_GHSL_regression(0.01,0.01,0.01,100,0.01,1,0.01,0.01,16079611,0.01,130,0.01) which correspond to GHSL R2023A study in 1423 of Chennai Metropolitan Area - for (*) a GHSL class 21 periurban cell of 1 square kilometer (growth rate of 25.377%) at a distance of 100 kilometers from urban center (*) metropolitan area population of 1,60,79,611 in 2023 (computed by Verhulste population growth model for annual growth rate of 2.39% based on 2022 Chennai metropolitan area population of 1.59 crores - Sections 1343 and 1350.14) and (*) Chennai Metropolitan Area GDP of $130 billion (GDP estimate sources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_metropolitan_area - $130 billion and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Chennai - $200 billion). Presently the sizeij (cell size) values are presumptive and can be substituted from a raster GeoTIFF file. 
1448.4 Earlier formula (2) is probably a first ever official regression for urban area delineation independent of machine learning-cellular automata models (1226.13),Polya Urn urban growth models and NightTimeLights radiance and it replaces urban area size by its population as proxy.
1448.5 Computation of FUA value for above data is at python-src/image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/testlogs/GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.log.28August2023 and can be normalized to a boolean value by adjustment of regression weights (by predefined minimum and maximum values for FUAij):
   FUAij (can be converted to a boolean value for whether periurban cell i belongs to urban area j): 2585539060011.65
1448.6 Population is chosen as a predictor of urban area size as described in the model (2) of the paper - "...... we compare three different proxies for urban centre size: area, population and nightlight....." while model (1) (section 1423.8) relied on number of cars which are proportional to nightlights. Distance in above model is actually proportional to the travel time from cell i to urban center j by public or private transport (or ease of mobility) - though it is still debatable on which travel time (fastest or slowest mode) has to be chosen. 
1448.7 Travel time to a periurban cell and Isochrone ego graphs in general could be estimated from Google Maps Live Traffic ViteJS implementation in NeuronRain Grafit (Drive Time Radius Isochrones are periodic snapshots of live traffic) - Section 1387 - https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/Grafit/tree/master/course_material/Programming/GUI/code/livetraffic . Emphasis on size of urban center as one of the FUA criteria is a rephrasal of preferential attachment (Big cities tend to get Bigger) - quoted excerpts from the paper - "...... Travel time from each cell to the urban centre is the most powerful predictor of the probability of belonging to a FUA, followed by the size of the urban centre ....."

1451.4 Steep increase in Mercury's gravity coincided with Marrakesh-Safi earthquake of 6.8 richter (Mercalli intensity 8) on 8 September 2023 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Marrakesh-Safi_earthquake - and another steep decline in Mercury's gravity during October 2023 coincides with monsoon season in southern India.
1451.5 Following are the matching date ranges for pairwise maximum angular separation of 180 degrees for Sun-Mars-Mercury-Venus-Saturn and 30 degrees for Venus-Mercury-Sun-Jupiter. Date range of 5-12 September 2023 coincides with proximities of Sun+Mars, Sun+Mercury, Sun+Venus, Mars+Mercury,Mercury+Venus and 1-19 October 2023 coincides with Jupiter+Venus which were prominent class association rules from sequence mining of  100 year USGS earthquake dataset in Section 148. Similarly date range of 9-26 October 2023 coincides with Sun+Mercury,5-12 September 2023 coincides with Mercury+Venus, 5-12 September 2023 coincides with Mars+Mercury which were prominent class association rules from sequence mining of HURDAT2 NOAA 100 year hurricane dataset. As mentioned elsewhere, following data establish only a machine-learnt correlation between gravity of celestial bodies and seismic-climate events while a detailed proof might involve experimental verification of ECMWF equations augmented with variable gravity g (Section 1358.7 - substituting g from N-body acceleration data computed):

We first demonstrate that, if the atmosphere obeys the hydrostatic primitive equations, which are a very good approximation for most terrestrial atmospheres, and if the radiative forcing is unaltered, changes in gravity have no effect at all on the circulation except for a vertical rescaling. That is to say, the effects of gravity may be completely scaled away and the circulation is unaltered. However, if the atmosphere contains a dilute condensible that is radiatively active, such as water or methane, then an increase in gravity will generally lead to a cooling of the planet because the total path length of the condensible will be reduced as gravity increases, leading to a reduction in the greenhouse effect. Furthermore, the specific humidity will decrease ....."

1451.9 The Effects of Gravity on the Climate and Circulation of a Terrestrial Planet - https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.11426 - ".... To investigate the changes in tropical temperatures associated with changing the gravitational constant, we turn to analysing changes in the tropical lapse rates. .... Here, increased gravity decreases surface moisture, and so decreases long-wave optical depth, leading to a colder surface. The decreased surface moisture increases the magnitude of the moist-adiabatic lapse rate and the upper troposphere cools more than the surface .... In this paper we have investigated the response of terrestrial atmospheres to a change in the gravitational acceleration at the planet’s surface. ..... The effects of a change in gravity on an Earth-like atmosphere arise from two main phenomena: 1. A change in the total column water vapour under gravity, arising from a change in the atmospheric scale height combined with the scaling invariance of the temperature field. Thus, in a higher gravity planet the atmosphere has a smaller vertical extent and less total water vapour. Since water vapour is a potent greenhouse gas this effect leads to an overall cooling of the atmosphere.  2. A change in the specific humidity, at least in a dilute atmosphere in which the condensible is a small fraction of the total atmosphere. In such an atmosphere q ≈ e/p, and since p scales with gravity while e does not, an increase of gravity leads to a general reduction in specific humidity. Thus, an increase in gravity leads to a reduction in the effects of condensation, with the following main effects: a. Changes in specific humidity lead to changes in the saturated adiabatic lapse rate, which is the dominant factor determining lapse rate in the tropics. An increase in gravity leads to warming near the surface and cooling aloft. This effect is very robust across all experiments and parameters.  b. Changes in surface sensible heat flux, surface stress, and latent heat fluxes from the surface, with the first two scaling like α but the third not. A reduction in q at higher gravity thus leads to a reduction in the relative importance of the latent heat flux compared to sensible heat flux. The effects of this are rather complicated, and lead to different amounts of long-wave cooling and polar cooling under higher gravity, differing quantitatively across experiments with different radiation schemes.  c. Changes in the relative components of the meridional energy flux. A reduction in q at higher gravity leads to a smaller meridional latent heat flux, but in many experiments this is compensated by an increase in the sensible heat flux. We do not ascribe a universality to this result......" - In N-Body climate model, most prominent variable gravity observed so far is that of Mercury on earth based on Horizon ephemerides implying a correlation between Mercury and gravity induced cooling.

1455.2 Function def grow_lambda_function3(self, text="None", level=3, textgraph=None, predict_word=False, fillintheblankstxt=None) has been enhanced to add two arguments - predict_word boolean flag and fillingtheblanktxt text file for Fill-In-The-Blanks algorithm described in 1413.7.
1455.3 If predict_word is set to True, transformer degree attention is computed and algorithm 1413.7 implemented by function fill_in_the_blanks() is executed.  
1455.4 Function def fill_in_the_blanks(self,prevtok,nexttok,definitiongraph,QKV) populates the argmax dictionaries for left and right context bigrams by iterating through path degree attention QKV data of the textgraph - these argmax dictionaries create a probability distribution on maximum likely word that might fill in the blanks. All simple paths between every s-t pair of word vertices in textgraph are looped through and a path degree attention for s-t path is populated (as sum of degree attentions of constituent vertices in each path) in 3 dictionaries for path QKV.
1455.5 grow_lamda_function3() is invoked by enabling predict_word and passing a text file RecursiveLambdaFunctionGrowth_FillInTheBlanks.txt whch has some blank words to be filled:

1458.1 Updated python-src/music_pattern_mining/AudioToBitMatrix.py to import PyTimbre2 for Timbre statistics computation of an audio waveform:
	from pytimbre2.audio_files.wavefile import WaveFile
	from pytimbre2.spectral.spectra import SpectrumByFFT
1458.2 Function def audio_features(audiofilename=None,signal_bitmap=None,frame_size=1024,hop_length=256) has been updated to add more arguments (audiofilename,frame size and hop length) for audio timbre and envelope computation. Envelope of the audio signal is already computed as onset strength while an overall amplitude envelope code has been added in this update to chunk the waveform into frames of predefined size and sampled at intervals of hop length from which maximum amplitude per frame is found constituting an envelope array. 
1458.3 Envelope array is printed for Attack-Decay-Sustain-Release (ADSR) model. Timbre statistics are obtained from PyTimbre2 timbre toolbox FFT spectrum roll off and average metrics (ADSR). Full timbre average features are computationally intensive and are printed based on a boolean flag timbreaveragefeatures.
1458.4 Example Envelope and Timbre quality measures are computed for AI synthesized waveform virtual_piano_music.WesternClassical.wav. Merit of an audio-visual has 2 connotations - (1) Quality of the content within the audio-music or the visual (2) Quality of audio-music or visual itself (clarity of the audio or resolution of the visual which depends more on the device capacity) - latter is more objective than the former in which judging the content of an audio-visual is subjective (requires human jury) and NeuronRain implements ImageNet deeplearning predictions based EventNet Tensor Product algorithm for objectively quantifying quality of the content.
