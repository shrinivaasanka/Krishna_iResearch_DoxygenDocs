This is a non-linearly organized, code puzzles oriented, continually updated set of course notes on Cloud computing frameworks and BigData analysis.

----------------
Apache Spark is a Cloud computing software for processing bigdata. It is based on concept of Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDD) which are partitions of a dataset executed in parallel. Spark is divided into 2 components: 1) Driver and 2) Executor. Driver splits the dataset into RDDs and allocates each RDD to an executor in parallel. Parallelization can be in two ways: 1) For objects like lists,arrays etc., 2) For data in HDFS,cassandra, S3 etc.,  

While executing in parallel, there is a necessity to share mutable state across executors. This is done in two ways: Broadcast variables and Accumulators (only increment is allowed). Spark streaming is a feature that allows realtime processing of streaming data by an abstraction of Discretized Streams or DStreams. Following code in neuronrain asfer receives generic data from any URL, does an ETL on it and stores in RDDs:
https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/asfer-github-code/blob/master/java-src/bigdata_analytics/spark_streaming/SparkGenericStreaming.java

There are 2 operations performed on RDDs: 1) Transformations - create a new set or subset of RDDs 2) Actions - do some iteration on transformed RDDs. Spark streaming allows custom streaming by implementing/overriding receive() method in Receiver interface. Receiver can be started and stopped by onStart() and onStop() methods. Receive method is overridden with customized code to access a remote URL, fetch HTML, parse it and do any ETL operation as deemed fit. From Spark 2.0.0 , support for lambda functions (new feature in Java 8) instead of *.function.* (Function objects) for RDD transformations has been included. Previous Spark Streaming code demonstrates these features and uses Jsoup GET RESTful API for ETL/scraping of remote URL data.

20 February 2017
----------------
Spark SQL + Hive (Shark) provides synergy of bigdata processing with an SQL storage backend. Hive is implemented on top of Thrift RPC protocol  which is modern version of Interface Definition Language based Web Service Architectures like CORBA, Google Protocol buffers , SOAP etc., Streamed data received is an iterable (e.g lines in SparkGenericStreaming.java implementation in https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/asfer-github-code/blob/master/java-src/bigdata_analytics/spark_streaming/SparkGenericStreaming.java) which is further transformed with map/filter operations quite similar to Java Streams. Java Streams work on similar concept of creating a stream from iterable (arrays, lists etc.,) and applying map/filter transformations. Spark's saveAsTable() saves the streaming data into a hive table in Spark Metastore or Hive metastore (this requires hive-site.xml in Spark conf directory). (MAC currency in AsFer+KingCobra electronic money cloud perfect forwarding move is implemented on Protocol Buffers.)

18 January 2018
---------------
Spark cloud processing framework has support for global variables in two flavours: 1) Accumulators and 2) Broadcast variables. Both of these are mechanisms to reflect global state across Resilient Distributed Data Set nodes in Spark clusters. Accumulators have a single operation add() which incrementally adds a value on a local RDD to the global accumulator variable and is reflected across all nodes in Spark cluster. Both Accumulators and Broadcast variables are instantiated from Spark Context. Broadcast variables are plain read-only global variables which are broadcast as the name suggests to all RDDs in Spark cluster. An example code and logs for how accumulators and broadcast work has been demonstrated in code/Spark_Broadcast_Accumulator.py and code/testlogs/Spark_Broadcast_Accumulator.log.18January2018. Accumulator constructor can be optionally passed on an object of type AccumulatorParam (or its subclassed types which override add()). Presently accumulators and broadcasts are only way to provide global state across nodes in Spark cluster.

4 October 2018 - Representational State Transfer - CRUD - RESTful and WebServices in Cloud
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Traditional Client-Server Architecture in Distributed Computing involves client making a socket connection to
a listener server, completing a handshake and establishing a two-way message transport.Over the years, with the
advent of cloud, every application on web is deemed to be a finite state automaton of 4 states - Create-Read-Update-Delete (CRUD) respective HTTP primitives being PUT,GET,POST,DELETE which create a resource in server, update it, read it and delete. Every resource is identified by a URL or WebService. Though this indirectly wraps the underlying socket communication, benefit is in statelessness of each request - every request is independent of previous request and state is remembered only in client side and server is state oblivious. Nomenclature RESTful stems from the state getting transferred from client to server for every HTTP request and responded in JSON objects. An example of RESTful API is Facebook Graph API SDK for retrieving user profile information, connections, comments, likes etc., A REST Python Client which GETs/PUTs objects to Facebook wall has been described in code/GRAFIT_automatic_wallposter.py. It internally issues HTTP requests to Graph API REST endpoints. Invocation to put_object() has been commented. This is an updated version of https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/asfer-github-code/blob/master/python-src/Streaming_FacebookData.py specific to GRAFIT (for Grafit Open Learning facebook profile https://www.facebook.com/shrinivaasan.ka which imports @NeuronRain_Comm - https://twitter.com/neuronrain_comm - automatic commit tweets). RESTful implies every cloud distributed computation is a string from alphabets {GET, POST, PUT, DELETE} amongst the nodes in cloud URL graph.

5 December 2018 - Apache 2 Web Server, Apache HTTPD modules, Configs and Hooks, Application Servers - example
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Apache webserver provides facilities to plugin user developed modules. One specific standard example is mod_ssl which is an SSL plugin module for Apache webserver. An example Apache module implementation and related forum Q&A have been cited in the references. This implementation was a part of Sun Microsystems/Oracle iPlanet Application Server which had a 3-tier J2EE compliant middleware architecture (Clients <-> WebServer <-> ApplicationServer). Application Servers are ancestors of present day cloud implementations which are Service Oriented Architectures. HTTP requests are served by Apache Webserver and responded. Necessity for an Apache module arises when Apache webserver is used as a loadbalancer for a cluster of application servers and requests have to be routed to it. Example module snippet in the reference defines config parameters for Apache webserver - the loadbalancer XML file containing details about cluster of iPlanet Application Servers and Locale. The register_hooks() function has callback functions for init, name translation (e.g. URL rewriting for session ids and cookies), and handle requests (e.g routing requests to another application server). These config parameters are set by invoking ap_set_string_slot() functions denoted by assignment to take1 structure member (function takes 1 argument)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Traditional Binary Search still remains the standard for sifting huge datasets and has undergone significant
refinements. Usual Binary Search is centred around midpoint computation and branching:
	midpoint = (left + right)/2
	if query > midpoint:
		search interval [midpoint, right] 
	else:
		search interval [left, midpoint]

Bug in Midpoint computation by previous averaging in some earlier versions of languages like Java caused an overflow error in 32-bit architectures which necessitated replacing it by >>> operator (unsigned right shift):
	midpoint = (right-left) >>> 1;
B-Trees are generalized Binary Search Trees in which each internal and root nodes contain more than one element and every element of a node acts as a separator for values of its subtrees as in example:
				2,10
				|
			1 ----- 3,9 ---- 11,12
				|
				4,5
B+-Trees extend B-Trees by additional linked-list of leaf nodes.

Indexing Bigdata e.g web pages involves storing them as huge set of key-value pairs of the form:
		word	--- (document1, location1), (document2, location2) ...
which is termed as posting in inverted indices. Size of an Index in search engine could be unimaginably large requiring partitions into set of rows located across geographically distant servers on cloud. This is horizontal partition based on rows as against vertical partitions of columns in DBMS Normalizations. Each partition is named a Shard.

Fundamental question is: can items in a list be found efficiently by a search graph instead of binary search trees. Lower bound for search is Omega(logN). Binary Search Trees can be alternatively defined as recursive bipartite graph which is an indefinite recursive fractal bipartition of sets - Example:- Set of integers [2,4,5,1,3,7,9,10,8,6] are represented recursively as bipartite graph by assuming an initial midpoint pivot separator of each subset similar to quicksort which partitions a set into two halves of elements > pivot and elements < pivot in each depth of recursion:
	pivot 6
	[2,3,5,1,4] ----- [7,9,10,8,6]
	pivot 3			pivot 8
	[[4,5,3]--[2,1]] ---- [[6,8,7]--[10,9]]
	pivot 4			pivot 7
	[[[4,3]-[5]]--[2,1]] ---- [[[7,8]-[6]]---[[10]-[9]]]
	pivot 4		pivot 2			pivot 7
	[[[[4]-[3]]-[5]]--[[2]-[1]]] ---- [[[[7]-[8]]-[6]]---[[10]-[9]]]

Edges are denoted by ----- which connect each parenthesized subset vertex for a subtree obtained by traversing the binary search tree. Last line encodes a recursive bipartite search graph which is the top view of the binary search tree and is a multidimensional tensor - a kind of binary space partition. Searching this tensor locates a point in the nested parentheses by comparing against pivots. Advantage of recursive bipartite graph representation of binary search tree is each subtree can be retrieved by array indexing.

Planar Point Location in Computational Geometry is the most fundamental generalization of conventional one dimensional list search to arbitrary dimensions. Computational Geometric Factorization algorithm implemented in NeuronRain AstroInfer is a two dimensional parallel geometric search which locates , in polylogarithmic time, factor points with in rectangular faces of planar straight line graph (PSLG) formed by rasterizing (pixel polygon approximation of an algebraic curve on a grid) hyperbolic arc bow on Parallel RAMs - this search involves two phases:
	(*) Locating a rectangle in PSLG polygon subdivision containing factor point in polylogarithmic time by some Parallel RAM Planar Point Location algorithm - PSLG has ~(3N+1) vertices and ~4N edges and each polygonal face is a pixel array rectangle of dimensions 1 * N/[x(x-1)]
	(*) Binary search the rectangle containing factor point - every rectangle in PSLG of rasterized hyperbolic arc is an arithmetic progression of pixels (ordinate products)

Hardness of Factorization has bearing on susceptibility of cryptographically secure Majority Voting to manipulation and its credibility.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An example hyperbolic arc rasterization - schematic - pixel array polygonal faces 
(arithmetic progression rectangles marked f denote faces containing factor points):

			###############
				       #########
						###########f###

Such a Planar Point Location can be extended to arbitrary dimensions > 2 and any other algebraic curve - E.g. algebraic curve uvwxyz=N is a 6-dimensional hyperbola and requires rasterization in 6-dimensional hyperplane to locate factor point (u,v,w,x,y,z). Multidimensional Point Location factorization is the problem of Factorisatio Numerorum (multiplicative partition). 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Randomized NC Geometric Search of a 2-dimensional grid and Linear Program Formulation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Grid filling algorithm which maximizes linear program of sum of binary values of ordinate points in Randomized NC has been described in https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/Analysis%20of%20a%20Randomized%20Space%20Filling%20Algorithm%20and%20its%20Linear%20Program%20Formulation.pdf and its Cellular Automaton, Apollonian Gasket-Circle Packing and Factorization-based Set-Partition-to-Lagrangian-Tile-Cover versions have been drafted in NeuronRain AstroInfer Design - https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/asfer-github-code/blob/master/asfer-docs/AstroInferDesign.txt . Grid Filling as constraint satisfaction problem which maximizes the number of points hit on a 2-dimensional space is a planar point location geometric search if BigData is visualized as values of ordinates within a 2-dimensional rectangle and a value for a query point has to be found by a parallel pseudorandom generator which simultaneously churns out multiple ordinate points (xi,yi) or circles of small radii centred around random ordinate points within the rectangle (Monte Carlo Simulation). This Randomized NC pseudorandom generator plane sweep covers most of the 2-dimensional rectangle with high probability. Advantage of RNC Grid filling: if query points constitute a meagre percentage of total 2-dimensional rectangular space e.g polynomial curve points, Randomized NC grid filling is able to find query point with high probability in polylogdepth NC without sorting and binary search. It is noteworthy that planar point location for Integer Factorization in exact NC can also be formulated as less stringent Randomized NC Grid filling which locates a factor on hyperbolic curve with high probability. Chaos theoretic RNC parallel pseudorandom generator defined in https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/ChaoticPRG.pdf could output pseudorandom ordinate bits in parallel.

Probability of hitting a query point within time t is a Bernoulli trial:
Probability of hitting a query point within a rectangle = number of query points or length of query polynomial curve embedded in 2-dimensional plane (p) / Area of rectangle of sides a and b (ab) = p/ab

If in time t there are m trials, probability of hitting only query points by pseudorandom sampling = (p/ab)^m, m trials are parallelized by Parallel Chaotic Pseudorandom Bits Generator which generates m 2-dimensional ordinate points simultaneously in Randomized NC.

Previous linear program for maximizing sum of (values are 0 or 1, pseudorandomly flipped) q ordinates x1 + x2 + x3 + ... + xq is exactly the sum of binary random variables Xi: X1 + X2 + ... + Xq. Berry-Esseen Central Limit Theorem - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berry%E2%80%93Esseen_theorem - implies normalized sum (mean) of random variables tends to a Normal distribution bell curve. Excluding tails of Normal distribution area of bell curve integral(f(x)*dx) from -left_tail to +right_tail is the approximate expected sum of ordinates randomly set to 0 or 1: x1 + x2 + x3 + ... + xq

Probability of hitting a query point after m-th trial (success after m-1 trials):
	(1-[p/ab])^(m-1)[p/ab]

In the context of factorization, geometric search reduces to finding factor points on a hyperbolic arc bow embedded in 2-dimensional rectangular space. Though less accurate compared to Exact NC-PRAM-BSP computational geometric planar point location, success amplification of RNC pseudorandom factor point location can be achieved by narrowing down the domain of pseudorandom search to a delta-rectangular strip vicinity in lower halfspace created by leading diagonal of the rectangle:

Length of the leading diagonal = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)

Area of delta-vicinity rectangular strip beneath the leading diagonal which contains the hyperbolic arc = delta * sqrt(a^2 + b^2)

Side of the rectangular strip - delta - is the distance between tangent of hyperbolic arc at (sqrt(N), sqrt(N)) and line connecting (1,N) and (N,1) which is a very small fraction of area of rectangle a*b.

Probability of hitting a query point within the rectangular strip = 
number of query points or length of query polynomial curve embedded in 2-dimensional plane / Area of rectangular strip = p/[delta * sqrt(a^2 + b^2)] >> p/[ab]

Probability of hitting a query point after m-th trial (success after m-1 trials):
	(1-[p/(delta * sqrt(a^2 + b^2))])^(m-1)[p/(delta * sqrt(a^2 + b^2))]
which amplifies success probability of finding a factor point.

For finding prime factors, number of query points p = kloglogN (Hardy-Ramanujan Theorem) and success probability of finding a factor point is substituted for p:
	(1-[kloglogN/(delta * sqrt(a^2 + b^2))])^(m-1)[kloglogN/(delta * sqrt(a^2 + b^2))]

For a square embedding of hyperbolic arc a=b and success probability amplifies to (delta is configurable):
	(1-[kloglogN/(delta * N * sqrt(2))])^(m-1)[kloglogN/(delta * N * sqrt(2))]

Neglecting delta vicinity, obvious randomization is to pseudorandomly choose an x-axis ordinate x between 1 and N and compute N/x which is a random ordered pair (x,N/x). For Randomized NC, x-axis is divided to N/(logN)^k intervals of width (logN)^k each. Each interval is assigned to a PRAM. Thus N/(logN)^k pseudorandom ordinate ordered pairs are simultaneously generated by a Chaotic Parallel PRG on N/(logN)^k PRAMs which is looped for (logN)^k iterations making it an RNC factorization. 

NeuronRain AstroInfer implements a sequential Chaotic PRG based on 1-dimensional binary Cellular Automata which grow chaotically by growth rule fraction lambda, Undecidable Mandelbrot sets, Logistic and Lehmer-Palmore chaotic PRGs. Spread of memes in Social Networks, pandemics, cybercrimes et al all have common Chaos,Game theory and 2-Dimensional Cellular Automata underpinnings (FTrace analyzer in USBmd is a game theoretic botnet defense model and a design of mechanism to counteract - antigame - as well) - For example Verhulst-Pearl-Reed Logistic Law and its Biological variant (lambda*x(1-x) and N0*exp(lambda(1-Nt))) analysis of CoronaVirus2019 pandemic reveals Bifurcation parameter lambda hovering approximately at 4.829487535509905... > 3.57 when chaos sets for a very small initial condition which implies emergence of order in Chaotic spread explained by Period Doubling ratio limit of Bifurcation parameter [lambda(n-1) - lambda(n-2)] / [lambda(n) - lambda(n-1)] - Feigenbaum universality constant 1 = 4.669201609... (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feigenbaum_constants). 

By pandemic cellular automaton model, spread of memes in Social networks can be formulated as RNC space filling problem - social network vertices spreading memes are parallelly chosen random points (people) on a rectangular space effecting a 2-dimensional cellular automaton of 8-neighbours (influenced by meme) per vertex. There are linear stretch PRGs (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s00037-007-0237-6 - [Applebaum-Ishai-Kushilevitz]) subject to assumptions in NC0 from which ordinate points can be computed in NC by splitting bit sequence (klogN bit pseudorandom string in NC is split into k (x,y) ordinates of length (logN/2, logN/2) each). As memes automata evenly cover the surface there is an overlap of neighbours adjoining all or some random points. By increment growth rule, overlapped neighbour vertices are incremented implying a high value vertex (point on grid) has high value neighbours and vice versa simulating any parallel random process (this is in discrete contrast to the continuous plane sweep by circles of small radii mentioned earlier). Thus a cellular automaton leads to a random cellular automaton planar graph (CAGraph):
	(*) Vertices are randomly chosen and labelled by instantaneous values of points on cellular automaton grid.
	(*) New edges are created when a point and its neighbours have non-zero value after some generations of increment growth rule 
	(*) Decrement growth rule would conversely obviate edges amongst zero points and neighbours thus simulating Susceptible-Infected-Recovered Erdos-Renyi SIR random graph model.
	(*) Between every non-zero valued point vertex and its non-zero neighbours (maximum degree = 8) 
on grid there is an edge
	(*) Clustering traits of previous CAGraph determine diffusion of a concept in community - strongly connected components of high value vertices are the most influenced giants.

Causal Event Models and Graphical Event Models (CEM and GEM) could be useful for Novel SARS CoronaVirus 2 2019 timeseries analysis. NeuronRain COVID19 analyzer is Python and R based. NeuronRain implements an EventNet GEM based on Recursive Lambda Function Growth Textgraph algorithm. CEM and GEM Integrated Crisis Early Warning System for COVID19 could hypothetically mine news and research articles on COVID19 by Recursive Lambda Function Growth EventNet GEM and grow textgraph from articles which unravels hidden cause-effects of actors and events(on how the keywords in the article are connected) - a random walk on the textgraph implies causality. NeuronRain Cellular Automaton Space Filling ER-SIR graph (CAGraph) has average degree (which depends also on population density) of multiples of 8:
	Per day Spread = 8 * w1 * I(nfected) - 1 * w2 * R(ecovered) - 1 * w3 * S(usceptible) + 1 * w4 * recovery_time ... + constant
COVID19 ER-SIR graph empirical data show R-number of 406 for 30 days (average degree > 400 - https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1-covid-patient-can-infect-406-if-physical-distancing-measures-are-not-followed-101619441843605.html) which makes it a potential expander graph. Random walk on COVID19 CAGraph (ER-SIR random graph) simulates transmission. Infection CAGraph is incidentally a Dynamic Graphical Event Model (GEM) because actors (S,I and R) and causations (infections) are dynamically created and removed - a timeseries of ordered pairs (actor_infected,time) if viewed as one dimensional stream of data wherein some ordered pair in stream is caused (infected) by some ordered pair in the past. Pandemic SIR ODE model has been invoked to explain diffusion of gossips and memes in social networks. Stanford Prison Experiment (Groups resign to their imposed roles) , Stockholm Syndrome (Captive likes captor), Bandwagon effect (Herding - People like an entity because peers like it) and Stanley Milgram Experiment (Power of authority) are oft-cited psychological precedents for explaining how authority, superior or peer opinions can influence decision in social communities (majority voting tends to get correlated swayed by peers) which in a sense is akin to preferential attachment.

Chaotic universality and Ramsey theoretic emergence of monochromatic arithmetic progressions in pseudorandomly colored sequences independently certify "Orderly Disorder" paradox. Recent Chaos Machine PRG by [Maciej A. Czyzewski] has a minimal example implementation of a Push-Hybrid-Pull Chaos Machine PRG computed by non-linear Chaos maps (Butterfly effect, Logistic map, Gingerbreadman map - Chaos Machine source code - https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/468.pdf):

Number of prime factors in [1,N] interval = aloglogN for constant a
Number of prime factors in unit interval = aloglogN/N

Number of prime factors in each of N/(logN)^k intervals of width (logN)^k = [aloglogN/N]*[(logN)^k]

Probability of chaotic pseudorandom choice of a prime factor within each (logN)^k width interval = [aloglogN/N]*(logN)^k/(logN)^k = aloglogN/N = Probability of parallelly locating a prime factor per interval in each Bernoulli trial.

Success amplification - probability of locating a prime factor in each of the (logN)^k Bernoulli trial iterations (Randomized NC) in parallel = (aloglogN/N)^(logN)^k which is exponentially small. Suitable choice of constant a and depth k of RNC circuit (number of trials) bounds the error and thus in BPNC.

Geometric search can be generic to any dataset beyond numeric including strings and texts. Words in text documents can be embedded in an m-dimensional vector space A^m for alphabet A (or language and script independent syllable space A^m if texts are syllable hyphenated) and length of longest word m which is a word embedding kernel for texts. E.g strings "word1" and "word2" in text are embedded as vectors [w,o,r,d,1,...] and [w,o,r,d,2,...] of m dimensions:

Size of the alphabet A (or syllables) = |A|

Length of the longest word in text (or longest syllable hyphenation) = m 

Previous kind of alphabet-syllable word embedding of text in a space of A^m clusters similar words by usual numeric euclidean distance measures as opposed to levenshtein edit distance. Traditional Latent Semantic Indexing Singular Value Decomposes a term-document matrix and computes low rank approximation for document similarity. Similarly LSI and SVD could be computed for previous word embedding of text which is an N*m matrix of word_id-alphabets for a text of N words of maximum length m.

NeuronRain AstroInfer has a polynomial encoding implementation of texts which curve fits a text to a polynomial in R^2 [points on polynomial are ordered pairs (alphabet_location,alphabet_unicode)] and PRP error correcting polynomial implementations. Multiple encoded polynomials of texts can be embedded on a 2-D plane and planar point location could be underneath rank() and select() queries on strings. Similarly, People analytics involve intrinsic merit vectors of people e.g [academic credentials, work experience,...] for people clustering. 

Finding closest pair of points in a set of points on a vectorspace has quite a few practical applications in sea and air traffic control and vehicle collision avoidance. Replacing the vehicle points by textual strings on a vectorspace (mentioned earlier) is helpful in finding closest pair of strings within a set of strings. Subquadratic closest pair of points detection is a geometric search problem and distance similarities amongst string datapoints could be ranked (by iteratively removing every closest point to a pivot point and recursively recomputing closest pair algorithm). Subquadratic string distance algorithms are important from complexity theoretic standpoint - Edit distance is a standard measure for string similarity (number of additions and deletions of alphabets necessary to morph one string to another) and subquadratic algorithm for edit distance might nullify SETH. If edit distance is expressible in terms of computational geometric algorithm for closest pair of string points, edit distance could be computed in subquadratic time.

Prerequisite for finding Closest pair of string vehicle datapoints by computational geometric divide and conquer earlier is: Number of strings (N) must equal Length of each string(n) (to attain O(nlogn) edit distance subquadratic bound). 

Example:
-------
	string1 - abcde - embedded as point [a,b,c,d,e]
	string2 - fghij - embedded as point [f,g,h,i,j]
	string3 - klmno - embedded as point [k,l,m,n,o] 
	string4 - pqrst - embedded as point [p,q,r,s,t] 
	string5 - uvwxy - embedded as point [u,v,w,x,y] 

Each alphabet is encoded as scalar from 1 to 26 and string vectors are embedded on 26^n vectorspace (similarly for ascii or unicode alphanumeric strings, vectorspace is 256^n or 512^n):
	string1 - [a,b,c,d,e] - [1,2,3,4,5]
	string2 - [f,g,h,i,j] - [6,7,8,9,10]
	string3 - [k,l,m,n,o] - [11,12,13,14,15]

Edit distance between string1 and string2 = 5. Euclidean distance between string1 and string2 = sqrt(5^2+5^2+5^2+5^2+5^2) = 5*sqrt(5). In general, euclidean_distance >= function_of(edit_distance) 

Earth mover distance and Word mover distance are current state-of-the-art similarity measures for BigData sets. Recently Earth Mover Distance has been approximated in linear time (Relaxed Word Mover Distance - [Kusner] - http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/kusnerb15.pdf) though exact computation is quadratic or cubic depending on algorithm. If Edit distance is expressible in terms of Earth mover distance, edit distance can be approximated in linear time which is subquadratic (closer to proving SETH is false) and if exact edit distance could be derived from this approximation in subquadratic time SETH is false. Following is an example reduction from Earth mover distance to Edit distance by tokenizing each string to 1-alphabet arrays or buckets creating a 2D array or histogram per string:

	abcde - [[a],[b],[c],[d],[e]]
	fghijk - [[f],[g],[h],[i],[j],[k]]

Earth mover distance or Relaxed Word Mover distance between 2 string histograms earlier is exactly equal to edit distance (work necessary in adding, updating or deleting 1-alphabet buckets for transforming one string to another). NeuronRain AsFer implements Earth Mover Distance similarity measure between two 2D syllabified string tensors.

Edit distance between 2 strings a and b is defined as recurrence solved by dynamic programming in quadratic time by Wagner-Fischer memoization algorithm:
	minimum(d(i-1,j-1),d(i-1,j) + delete(ai),d(i,j-1) + insert(bj),d(i-1,j-1) + substitute(ai,bj))

Traditional edit distance dynamic programming recurrence memoization table could be split into quadrants - one of constant size (bottom left) and the other 3 quadrants of variable size. Constant size quadrant of the table could be computed by Earth Mover Distance reduction (LC-RWMD or LC-ACT) in linear time exactly by suitably choosing the number of iterations for 100% accuracy. Rest of the 3 quadrants could be computed by conventional quadratic time edit distance algorithms. Cumulatively total time to compute edit distance is subquadratic (exponent k in O(n^k) is 2-epsilon < 2) because a constant fraction of tableau is computed in linear time. For example exponent could be 1.9999999.... which adheres to definition of subquadratic though superlinear thus proving SETH is 100% false.

Linear Complexity Approximate Constraints Transfer (LC-ACT) is the generalization of all WMD measures and its accuracy can be controlled by number of iterations(k). Linear Complexity of LC-ACT is achieved by setting k to be a constant. LC-ACT has maximum accuracy of 97.83% for 15 iterations for MNIST dataset (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). Increasing the constant for number of iterations would asymptotically boost accuracy close to 100%. 99% accuracy of LC-RWMD or LC-ACT for increased iterations implies edit distance is approximable by previous Edit-Distance to EMD reduction in linear time and SETH is false with 99% probability (or) there is an error of +1% or -1%. Deriving exact edit distance from approximate LC-ACT distance in linear time would prove SETH is 100% false. Edit distance from previous dynamic programming recurrence is an integer if weights for delete,insert and substitute primitives are integers. E.g For exact edit distance of 200 between 2 strings, 99% accurate LC-ACT-k computes an approximate distance of 198 or 202 in linear time. Each of the integral values in +1% or -1% error range - 198,199,200,201,202 - have to be sifted for exact edit distance. This requires a verification algorithm in linear time which accepts a numeric argument in the error range and 2 strings and prints if it is exact edit distance between 2 strings. Pseudorandomly choosing one of the integers in error range and repeating the trials might amplify success. Each recursive step in dynamic programming recurrence earlier for edit distance could be computed by LC-ACT-k at 99% accuracy. If definition of subquadratic time allows fractional exponent in runtime O(n^k) for 1 <= k < 2, then SETH is still false though ACT is super-linear but still subquadratic and ACT iterations could be increased accordingly for close to 100% accuracy.

Edit distance dynamic programming recurrence could be summarized as:
	Edit distance = n(s) + n(i) + n(d)
	n(s) = number of substitutions
	n(i) = number of insertions
	n(d) = number of deletions

Each of the approximate edit distances in LC-ACT error range could be equated to previous summation:
	Approximate LC-ACT Edit Distance = n(s) + n(i) + n(d)

For 2 strings of equal lengths n(i) and n(d) are zero => n(s) = approximate edit distance in LC-ACT error range(-1% to +1% error band for 99% accuracy)

Machine Learning solution for deriving exact edit distance from LC-ACT approximate edit distance:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create a training dataset of strings and compute exact edit distances and LC-ACT approximate edit distances for every pair of strings and find the average deviation between exact and approximate edit distances.This learnt deviation could be applied as heuristic correction for exact edit distance to LC-ACT approximate edit distances between 2 arbitrary strings.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timeout design pattern implemented as a separate chaining/dictionary of timeouts-to-processes has been described in ../AdvancedComputerScienceAndMachineLearning/AdvancedComputerScienceAndMachineLearning.txt. Discussion there is restricted to a process id present in only one bucket per timeout value. But there are possibilities when same process_id has to be multilocated in many timeout buckets e.g multiple threads spawned by a process can have different timer values for varied functionalities and all those threads per process have to be timedout. 

Spark MLlib implements parallel version of FP-Growth algorithm  which mines frequent itemsets in multiple baskets with no candidate generation (downward closure) by growing suffix trees. Survival Index Timeout Map is also a set of baskets (buckets) from which frequently occurring process subsets can be mined by Spark FPGrowth. Example Spark code for this has been committed to code/Spark_FPGrowth_SurvivalIndexTimeout.py and logs in code/testlogs/Spark_FPGrowth_SurvivalIndexTimeout.log.21January2019 which demonstrate minimum support for frequent occurrences and minimum confidence for association rules. These frequently occurring process subsets point to some lurking relationship among the colocated processes in some way and thus a measure of system load and behaviour.

Multilocation of process id(s) in multiple time out buckets creates hyperedges amongst the timer bucket vertices and thereby a hypergraph.

19 March 2019 - String Search in Large Files
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BigData or Large Text Files on clouds often require a functionality to quickly search for a string of patterns or text. There are standard string matching algorithms like Knuth-Morris-Pratt, Boyer-Moore etc., which are standard algorithms implemented in text editors for "find". For large filesystems, wavelet trees are fast alternatives which support rank(c,p) [number of occurrences of character c before position p], select(c,q) [q-th occurrence of character c], access(k)[access k-th position] operations in O(1) time for binary vectors. For substring pattern p of size n, repetitive n invocations of select(p[i],q) returns all substrings of pattern p in the large text file - Example Pseudocode below for first match:
		for k in xrange(n):
			pos=wavelettree.select(p[k],1)
			if prevpos + 1 != pos
				return matchfound==false
			prevpos=pos
		return matchfound==true

26 March 2019 - Example MapReduce in Spark 2.4 Cloud - Bitonic Sequences of Integers
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spark framework parallelizes work by partitioning a bigdata set into Resilient Distributed Datasets
which are map()-ped to Spark cloud nodes by Spark Executor Driver and local computations in cloud node are unified by reduce(). Spark 2.4 + Python Spark code example in code/Spark_MapReduce.py defines two functions map() and reduce(). Spark context is instantiated and an array of integers is parallelized to
Spark resilient distributed dataset partitions and map() is invoked per RDD on Map function - Map() which returns a single element array as a tuple. This is followed by reduce() on Reduce function - Reduce() which takes as args two mapped tuples and merges the integer arrays after > or <= checks to create a subarray which is either strictly ascending or descending. Resultant array is checked for sortedness by a function and mapreduces further if not. Logs for this in Spark_MapReduce.log.26March2019 demonstrate the bitonic sequence n1 + n2 which fluctuate (ascending-descending-ascending):
Reduce: (1, [15], 1, [16], 1, [12], 1, [7], 1, [6], 1, [3], 1, [2], 1, [4], 1, [5])
n1: (1, [15], 1, [16], 1, [12], 1, [7], 1, [6], 1, [3], 1, [2], 1, [4], 1, [5])
n2: (1, [23], 1, [32])
Reduce: (1, [15], 1, [16], 1, [12], 1, [7], 1, [6], 1, [3], 1, [2], 1, [4], 1, [5], 1, [23], 1, [32])
Bitonic Sequence of Integers:
[15, 16, 12, 7, 6, 3, 2, 4, 5, 23, 32]

As can be seen, the reduce produces a huge tuple from which an integer array is extracted after typecheck by Python keyword "type".

This demonstrates the integer partition and LSH/set partition-separate chaining isomorphism. Logs in Spark_FPGrowth_SurvivalIndexTimeout.log.16April2019 show the all possible permutations of process set partitions.Rank of a partition is printed which is the difference between size of largest part and number of parts (or) equivalently side of largest square in Durfee Diagram.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Collaborative Filtering based Recommender Systems works by plotting a matrix of users versus their item choices and predicting preferences of new users or missing preferences based on inferences from the user-items matrix. Advertisement Analytics by computing PageRank of viewer channel switch graph (converging markov random walk) is explained in https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/Grafit/blob/master/course_material/NeuronRain/AdvancedComputerScienceAndMachineLearning/AdvancedComputerScienceAndMachineLearning.txt. Spark MLLib predefines a function for alternating least squares (ALS) collaborative filtering on cloud. Code example in Spark_RecommenderSystems.py which is a modified version of documentation example in https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-collaborative-filtering.html adapts to channel recommendation systems based on user surveyed matrix of viewer-channel matrix.This is an alternative advertisment analytics.Channel ratings of viewers are read from text file AdvertisementAnalytics_RecommenderSystemsCF.txt having fields - viewer, channelid, rating and timestamp.
ALS factorizes the user-item matrix into User and Item matrix factors and minimizes a quadratic optimization function:
	UserItem = User * Item (Factorization)
	(UserItem - User * Item)^2 (Minimization)
ALS makes either User or Item factor constant alternatingly and converts to a quadratic optimization problem.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NeuronRain Research version of AstroInfer in SourceForge mines astronomical data e.g encoded ephemeris degree locations of celestial bodies, planetary positions on zodiac etc., by native sequential implementation of GSP Sequence Mining algorithm. Spark MLlib provides cloud implementation of an advanced sequence mining algorithm - PrefixSpan which recursively projects a sequence dataset to smaller fine grained datasets and locally mines frequent patterns in smaller databases which are grown (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1339268 - Mining sequential patterns by pattern-growth: the PrefixSpan approach - Jian Pei,Sch. of Comput. Sci., Simon Fraser Univ., Burnaby, BC, Canada,Jiawei Han,B. Mortazavi-Asl,Jianyong Wang,H. Pinto,Qiming Chen,U. Dayal,Mei-Chun Hsu). An example code for Spark PrefixSpan pattern mining for encoded astronomical datasets (encoding is numeric 1-to-9 for each of the 9 planets spread across 12 zodiac houses delimited by #) is at code/Spark_PrefixSpan.py. It prints frequently occurring celestial juxtapositions of planets in the dataset. Large scale mining of celestial data can be used for variety of scientific applications - solving n-body gravitational differential equations, correlating frequent planetary patterns to terrestrial seismic events and weather forecast. Curiously enough, each encoded string of celestial configuration is a set partition and is an instance of balls-bins problem - set of celestial bodies are bucketed by some permutation amongst 12 houses - number of such celestial configurations are governed by Bell and Stirling numbers which is derived as below (background n-body problem choreography analysis is in NeuronRain FAQ - https://neuronrain-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):
	Number of ordered partitions of length p of 9 celestial bodies = N(p)
	Summation_p=1-to-9(N(p)) = B9 - 9th Bell Number (= binomial series summation of Stirling Numbers of second kind) = 7087261
	Number of all possible choreographic arrangements of 9 celestial bodies amongst 12 zodiac degree divisions = Summation_p=1-to-m(12CN(p)) which is lowerbounded by B9 >= 7087261 = number of celestial patterns to be correlated to terrestial events. This is a finite number implying repetitive patterns in gravity induced events.

Non-perceptive intrinsic performance rankings (IPR) have been mentioned as one of the multiple classes of measuring intrinsic fitness/merit as part of People Analytics in https://neuronrain-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ without voting. IPRs are widely used to rank Chess players (e.g Elo ratings). As an alternative bigdata usecase, stream of cricket match statistics is analyzed for intrinsic merit (Example hawkeye statistics - wagon wheel, trajectories, pitch maps - in https://www.bcci.tv/events/15305/india-v-west-indies-2019/match/15309/1st-odi?tab=overview#hawkeye). NeuronRain Set Partition and Histogram analytics implementations elicit patterns from stream of histogram set partitions by multitude of distance measures - earth mover distance, partition rank, correlation among others:
	(*) Batting, Fielding and Bowling figures per match for 11+11=22 players can be plotted as a histogram of player versus runs/wickets. 
	(*) Streaming Set partition analytics is a special case of Histogram analytics - stream of histograms can have varied total sum of parts while stream of set partitions have oscillating parts but constant total sum of parts.
	(*) Stream of match statistics histograms (which always have constant 11 parts per team) as time series has the imprint of team performance over the period of time.
	(*) Partition Rank which is defined as maximum part - number of parts is an indicator of skewness in the team performance (maximum runs/wickets scored by a player - 11 per team)
	(*) Durfee square which is the side of largest square inscribed in Ferrer diagram of the match statistics histogram measures if the performance is equitable - larger the square, more players performed nearly equally.
	(*) Time series of Earth mover distance between consecutive match statistics histograms in the stream sheds light on seasonal trend in team performance.
	(*) Patterns in Wagon wheel graphics of shots played per player measures strengths of each player - stream of wagon wheels can be mapped to a histogram of shots and aforementioned metrics apply.  
	(*) Clustering of Bowling trajectories/pitch maps extract stereotypes.

Most games have been analyzed for their computational complexity - E.g Go, Chess are either in PSPACE or EXPTIME depending on rules. Cricket on the other hand could be theoretically formulated as two True Quantified Boolean Formulae Satisfiability problems in PSPACE - TQBF1 and TQBF2 - forall and existential quantifiers in each formula symbolize team1 and team2 per innings (adversary-defender game). Batting and Bowling Roles (respectively governed by existential and forall quantifiers) for 22 player statistics variables are interchanged in each innings. Maximum satisfied formula decides the winner and game is undecidable if drawn/tied.

Mining soccer patterns is complex because of random trajectories of the ball which draws a random directed graph on field - trajectory is a brownian motion random walk - whose vertices are 2-colored (bichromatic for vertices belonging to two opponent teams). Consecutive match statistics create a stream of 2-colored random graphs and frequent subgraph patterns in this stream of random trajectory graphs show patterns across matches.

(THEORY and FEATURE) Social Network Analytics, People Analytics, Preferential Attachment, Urban Sprawls, Graph Edit Distance and Intrinsic Merit Rankings - 20 February 2020,26 February 2020,29 April 2020,17 May 2020,18 May 2020,28 May 2020,15 August 2020,24 December 2020 - related to 762, 821, 1128 and all sections on urban planning analytics, GIS analytics among other topics in NeuronRain Theory Drafts
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NeuronRain AstroInfer codebase has implementations for urban planning analytics including analytics of Remote sensing imagery , GIS 2-D patches extraction, Watershed image segmentation specific to urban sprawls et al. Urban planning analytics could be termed a special category lying in intersection of People analytics and Social Network analytics - difference being people profiles and social profile vertices in world wide web are replaced by real humans and urban clusters. There exists a striking parallel between preferential attachment in social networks and formation and growth of urban agglomerations - Processes underneath why certain social profiles attract more incoming links and why people flock to megapolises (and megalopolises formed by countermagnets) have clustering similarities. Preferential attachment in social networks causes profiles of large followers to be larger or famous become more famous while big cities become megacities. It is self-explanatory that perception underlies preferential attachment (because population is swayed by and gravitates to majority). Average degree of a vertex in Social networks is replaced by population density in Urban sprawls. 

On the contrary, rationale for ranking social profiles by their intrinsic least energy merit characterized by inverse lognormal sum of education(E), wealth(W) and valour(V) (energy of social profile vertex is directly proportional to 1/(logE + logW + logV)) defined and implemented in NeuronRain AstroInfer applies as well to the ability of an urban sprawl to attract population and ranking urban areas absolutely. Some of the following example standard of living factors could be classified into three divisions of lognormal sum (inverse lognormal sum could be broken-up into following finer contributing factors):
	- Harbours, Coastal areas (Wealth)
	- Infrastructure (Wealth)
	- Manufacturing,IT and ITES jobs (Wealth)
	- Education and R&D institutions (Education)
	- Financial institutions (Wealth)
	- Antiquity, Tourism and Culture (Valour)
	- Salubrious and Cool climes (less likely)
	...

Previous division of Social profile vertices into 3 categories may infact be 4 if Wealth category is segregated into Working class and Business profiles:
	(*) Profiles of Academics and Researchers - Education (E)
	(*) Profiles of Sports personalities - Valour (V)
	(*) Profiles of Business - Wealth1 (W1)
	(*) Profiles of Working class - Wealth2 (W2)
which would consummate to lognormal least energy sum logE + logV + logW1 + logW2. On the contrary such a division of social profiles may not be Four color theorem compliant - there is no or least avoidance of colors (categories) of neighbours (though W1 and W2 are repulsive). NeuronRain People Analytics implements Chaotic HMM state machine model for tenure transitions of a profile and an alternative weighted automaton model is put forth (state transitions between organizations are incentivized by weights). Attributing merit to people tenure transitions reduces to rating incentives for choices made e.g:
	(*) transition from industry to academics is considered nobler than industry-to-industry.
	(*) transition from academics to industry is majority choice 
	(*) transition from low remuneration to high is a majority choice 
	(*) transition from high remuneration to low is rare
	(*) transition from employment to entrepreneur is rare and considered less risk-averse
	(*) transition from low designation to high is majority choice
Weights of the transitions in Weighted Automata Tenure model are decided by ranking of rarity of choices earlier. Comparing state machines (ChaoticHMM or Weighted Automata) of tenures of two social profiles is the problem of Equivalence of Regular languages (verify if two automata are similar) solved by Table filling algorithm. NeuronRain AstroInfer People Analytics implements career transition analytics based on a weighted automaton derived from graded incentives for previous state transition choices - rare transitions are rewarded. Fluctuating weights between consecutive transitions as points on polynomials could be interpolated to a polynomial career graph and similar profiles could be clustered by distance of those career polynomials e.g Distance between polynomials is defined by inner product spaces - http://web.mit.edu/18.06/www/Spring17/Orthogonal-Polynomials.pdf. In the context of "original music score" merit measurement, equivalence of weighted automata of two music compositions is verifiable by Table filling.
 
GIS imagery of any urban sprawl can be segmented by watershed algorithm or contour detection to following categories (or by approximate color of pixels):
	(*) Manufacturing,IT and ITES
	(*) Residential
	(*) Commercial
	(*) Agricultural lands, Water bodies (Groundwater and Surfacewater) & Greenery
which correspond to four color cartography of the urban sprawl. By Four color theorem, segments of urban sprawl master plan could be colored by any of the four categories in a way which prevents any neighbor of a segment to be of same category thereby ensuring equitable and sustainable development. Fair Division of resources within an urban sprawl (water,amenities,...) is a Pareto optimal Multiple Agent Resource Allocation (MARA) problem. An allocation is Pareto optimal if no agent is preferentially treated at the expense of its peers (Envy-free) while a Nash equilibrium occurs when every agent is at its best and can't do better. Four categories or colors of an urban sprawl GIS segmentation earlier correspond to Four agents among whom a resource has to be fairly divided - an analytics alternative to Four color theorem. Segments of an urban sprawl GIS imagery form a Dual graph induced by segment vertices (faces) and their adjacency. Four coloring theorem stems from 4-colorability of unavoidable sets and 1482 reducible configurations. On the lines of TCP congestion control in electronic networks, Bottleneck measures (e.g Expanders, Cheeger constant) of 4-colored FaceGraph of a segmented urban sprawl GIS imagery help in theoretically solving the traffic congestion problem in urban sprawls - Most transport in urban sprawls happens amongst 3 face categories of FaceGraph - Manufacturing-IT-ITES,Residential and Commercial. Four colored Facegraph of segmented urban sprawl GIS imagery has an inherent feature which decongests traffic snarls - every s-t path between vertices of Facegraph is 4-colored (two consecutive vertices in a path avoid same color) implying every route in transport network traverses perfect mix of 4 face categories earlier. Graph Edit Distance between FaceGraphs of 2 urban sprawls is a theoretical measure of similarity which quantifies Urbanization and thus could be used in Ranking Urban agglomerations. FaceGraph as a Flow network (Maxflow-Mincut problem) of face vertices maximizes traffic between source and sink faces through minimum cut edges which if removed would disconnect source from sink. Apart from these population dynamics of urban sprawls are of statistical importance and are necessary for redrawing and expanding urban boundaries. Ricker non-linear logistic N(t+1) = N(t)e^(r(1-N(t)/K) formalizes growth of population from generation t to (t+1) from which future population projections for an urban sprawl could be inferred (implemented as R script in GRAFIT course material). Increasing population implies increasing population density (average degree) for constant sprawl. 

Extent of correlation between Rankings of Urban Sprawls by Population (mostly caused by preferential attachment - Urban Area Rankings in Section 675 of https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/asfer-github-code/blob/master/asfer-docs/AstroInferDesign.txt) and Intrinsic Lognormal Sum Least Energy Merit is a measure of Fame-Merit coincidence.

(THEORY and FEATURE) Word Embedding on a Vectorspace - Spark SkipGram Log Likelihood - Text Similarity, Dissimilarity and Merit Measure of Originality - 10 May 2020,11 May 2020 - related to 762,815 and all sections on Kernel Lifting, Intrinsic Merit of Academic publications/Large Scale Visuals/Music/People, Psychoanalysis and Shell Turing Machines
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Word2Vec Embedding in Spark MLLib maps words in a text to vectors in a Vectorspace which facilitates 
clustering of synonymous words - Words of similar meaning and context are in proximity on the vector space. This kind of kernel lifting from one dimensional text to multidimensional vectorspace of words in Spark MLLib is implemented as a SkipGram. SkipGram maximizes average loglikelihood for a word wt and a context training window for wt of width 2k - w(t-k),...,w(t+k):
		1/T ∑t=1,T ∑j=−k,k logp(w(t+j)|wt)
Code example Spark_Word2Vec.py defines a function bibliometrics_word2vec() which analyzes text file bibliographies from Semantic Scholar(https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Ka.-Shrinivaasan/1861803), DBLP(https://dblp.dagstuhl.de/pers/hd/s/Shrinivaasan:Ka=) and GoogleScholar (https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=eLZY7CIAAAAJ&hl=en) profiles of author on quadcore and Python 3.7.5 and tries to find synonyms and clustering similarities (by cosine distance). Sections 762 and 815 propound an alternative merit measure of "Originality" (how dissimilar a work is from other authorships and common theme similarity amongst author's works) which can be best captured by Word2Vec vectorspace embeddings of texts wherein computation of euclidean distance clustering similarity between word vectors is easier. Analyzing academic publications is a field in itself - Bibliometrics and Scientometrics - once touted to be an alternative to peer review. It is worth noting that TextGraph representation of texts offers Graph Isomorphism and Graph Edit Distance as graph theoretic concept similarity alternatives. Originality thus distinguishes seminal papers (differentiated by huge conceptual distance from earlier works), independent of H-index (Fame measure based on voting - citations), which ushered a revolution when they were published. H-index is the Durfee Square of the Integer Partition of Citations amongst papers and approximately equals 0.54*sqrt(N) for total citations N. Concept similarity is defined by archetypes (Thought motif from which copies are made) in Carl Jungian Psychoanalysis (Pattern of Thought in collective unconscious).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There exists a fine division in quantifying merit of a natural language text and academic publications cutting across disciplines - theoretical and experimental. Natural language texts are measurable by mental representation of meaning and its lambda function approximation (Recursive Lambda Function Growth) whereas every academic publication could be construed as sequence of first order logic formulae connected by logical implications - from conjecture to QED. In Sequent Calculus proof has a tree structure and every line of a proof is a conditional tautology on previous lines. Girard Geometry of Interactions maps every theorem-proof to geometry of logical statements (ProofNets) by defining trip operator (Long Trip Criterion) on proof network. For instance, Coq Theorem Prover has been used to verify proof of Four Color Theorem by [Appel-Haken]. Thus Concept distance for Originality merit measure between any two academic publications could be defined as the distance between their ProofNet GoIs (e.g graph edit distance between ProofNets). On a related note, Distance between two First order logic (FOL) statements is the problem of equivalence of 2 FOL formulae F1 and F2: If F1 == F2, distance is 0 else distance is the number of mismatches in truth table - To prove F1 == F2, both F1 => F2 and F2 => F1 have to be established. There are two other prominent proof calculi - Hilbert and Natural Deduction. Analyzing academic publications and theorem-lemma-proofs therein thus has two facets: 1) Natural Language Processing - Lambda Function approximation, Word2Vec embedding of concepts and their clustering 2) Formal Logic - Proof theory - Sequents, Gentzen Cut-Elimination (A |- B,C and D,B |- E then A,D |- C,E), ProofNet-GoIs . There is an alternative Category theoretic formalism of Proofs wherein every proof entailment A |- B is a morphism A -> B between objects A,B in a monoidal category M having a binary operator * - entailment morphisms thus constitute a ProofNet directed graph (a quiver in Category jargon - https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/quiver). Geometry of Interaction in Linear Logic and Type theory considers A |- B as an endomorphism.

1.This commit revamps Spark_Word2Vec.py implementation to parse an entire article text to extract a concept cloud wordle from it by Spark SkipGram Word2Vec. Word2Vec is computationally intensive and corpora-hungry for producing accurate embedding.
2.New text file Spark_Word2Vec_PublicationFullText.txt is read which contains a draft publication of author on "Majority Voting" - https://5d99cf42-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/kuja27/IndepthAnalysisOfVariantOfMajorityVotingwithZFAOC_2014.pdf
3.Concepts and respective vectors for them are pretty-printed. Concept cloud of full text is quite meaningful and captures the essential words in the text. Clustering of related concepts is implied by Synonyms printed.
4.Recursive Gloss Overlap and Recursive Lambda Function Growth algorithm implementations in NeuronRain could benefit from Word2Vec in filtering less important words while computing textgraphs, euclidean distance among them and their dense subgraph k-cores which serve as unsupervised text classifiers.
5.Extracting a composition of Lambda Functions from Natural Language Text of a Publication and First order logic (FOL) ProofNet representation of Theorems therein are empirically equivalent - former is a Turing machine while the latter is its FOL version. Example Beta Reduction ((lambda.x t)s) in reference 829.1 translates a natural language sentence to lambda function:
	Whiskers disdained catnip => disdained(Whiskers,catnip) 
which could be written as FOL statement:
	There exist x There exist y (x disdained y) 
and model {Whiskers,catnip} satisfies it. Recursive Lambda Function Growth algorithm works by Beta Reduction and is motivated by Grounded Cognition in Cognitive Psychology. Thus ProofNet or Category morphisms representation of texts is not just limited to academic publications but pervades any natural language text.
Meanings of Natural Language Texts captured by Recursive Gloss Overlap and Recursive Lambda Function Growth TextGraph representation algorithms could be compared by Graph Edit Distance algorithms which is NP-Hard  and APX-Hard (hard to approximate) though there are polynomial approximations for Graph Edit Distance. Graph Edit Distance is the problem of Inexact Graph Matching for dissimilar graphs (while Graph Isomorphism is Exact Graph Matching for similar graphs) solved by computing optimal edit paths through A*-algorithm. Graph Edit Distance generalizes String edit distance - every string is a connected directed acyclic graph of maximum indegree 1 and outdegree 1.
6.Vectorspace embedding of concepts in an article basically does a kernel lifting of the model to arbitrary dimensional Topological space and from equivalence of Lambda functions-First order logic mentioned earlier, every first order logic statement in the ProofNet is indirectly kernel lifted and implication entailments between them are replaced by monoidal category morphisms between one logical statement embedded in space S1 to another embedded in S2 (A(S1) |- B(S2) is a morphism A(S1) -> B(S2) in a theorem monoidal category). Word2Vec typically embeds all concepts in single space and thus S1=S2.
7.Thus every theorem-proof could be stated as TOP category of first order logic objects in some topological space and morphisms amongst them.
8.Spark_Word2Vec.py has been made Python 3.7 compatible by autopep8 and 2to3.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Finding parity of a boolean string is a major open problem in Computational Complexity which is not known to be in AC0 (constant depth) but in NC1 (log depth parallel computing).
BigData version of parity is the problem of Population Count which pertains to finding number of 1s in a stream of bits. Lot of algorithms
for population count have been invented in Hardware and Artificial Intelligence literature - Divide and Conquer, HAKMEM, CSA(Carry Save Adder) etc., . Code example Spark_PopulationCount.py reads a CSV file containing a huge binary string and computes the number of 1s in it by sequential and parallel mapreduce. String is split into words of length 32 and parallelized to RDDs. Each word is then scanned by a mapbitstream() and population_count() functions which sequentially compute the function:
	pop(x) = -1 * Summation((x << n)) for each bit position n.
Bit left shift has been replaced by access to literal in bitstream string. Reduce function reducebitstream() gathers and sums each 32-bit word. Population count gains importance in the context of efficiently counting number of votes in a theoretical Electronic Voting Machine.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patents are uniquely granted to individuals and corporations who have invented an original concept which could be underneath any STEM artifact. Patent Search is a time consuming process and could take years to validate a patent application and involves human effort to find Concept similarity (Novelty detection,Prior art). Novelty detection and Originality are thus synonymous - Latent Semantic Analysis by SVD (X = U(Eigen)Z^T) and low rank approximation (choose creamy layer of UEZ^T) of term-document matrix of patents mines concept words related to each other. Alternatively, First order logic ProofNet format of patent applications written in natural languages could be an apt model to quantify conceptual distance and patent search. Patent database is a massive open online dataset (MOOD) and Concept similarity search could be automated by a ProofNet distance computations amongst pairs of patent GoIs on a cloud thus replacing humans. This commit computes a Concept Cloud wordle of set of example team software patents author was involved as former staff (Sun Microsystems-Oracle)

Cybercrimes are a scourge on society causing immense economic damage. Distinguishing a spoofed email from genuine origin is an artificial intelligence problem and is still less solved. Spam filters and Firewalls in Mail service providers have machine learning algorithm implementations which segregate botnet senders from humans to some extent (Spam folders in mailboxes use Bayesian filters to differentiate frequency of words in human and robot senders). A commonsense workaround to spoofs: As against keyboard typed emails, text could be a handwritten image (scanned or touchscreen stylus written) backedup by a private hardcopy which is digitally watermarked and sent through usual HTTPS/IMAP/POP/SMTP infrastructure. Written emails are less spoof-prone and less forgeable (because of private hardcopy duplication) and introduce an additional layer of reCAPTCHA Turing tests to discern a robot from human. Old school Post office mails are written and stamped hardcopies. Most cybercrimes are difficult to probe not just because of their international impact but as well due to complex traffic routing (e.g Onion routers) which obfuscate IP, munge headers and fudge dates. Parallels between pandemics and cybercrime transmission are fascinating:
	(*) Pandemics are air,vector,contact borne while Cybercrimes are ISP-borne, proliferate by address book lookups (e.g Worm spreads by infecting an id and recursively traversing contacts - contacts per id could be a huge number and thus infection graph could be an expander of high degree)
	(*) Both pandemics and cybercrimes follow Game theoretic (Botnet adversary-defender game), SIR and SIS models of infections 

Predominant attacks which render RSA dysfunctional are Radio-Frequency Van Eck Phreaking (capturing RF signals from monitors),Keystroke loggers (Trojan/Malware capturing keystroke signals), SQL and JavaScript XSS Injection attacks which execute malicious code in client side et al. Some example past cybercrime incidents of author's credentials (compromise of linkedin id by password reset, spoofs of yahoo webmail and past institutional affiliation ids) and their traffic pattern (headers) have been committed to code/testlogs/Cybercrime_examples/

Recursive Lambda Function Growth textgraph algorithm implemented in NeuronRain could be a spam filter - growing a textgraph of an email text and classifying the text by genre of top percentile core number word vertices is a mail segregation mechanism.

841. (THEORY and FEATURE) Digital Watermarking of Large Scale Visuals in OpenCV - related to 581,840 and all sections on Large Scale Visual Recognition Analytics, Handwriting Recognition and Fraud analytics - 10,11,12 July 2020
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This commit implements an OpenCV python function which reads a large scale visual (Video) and a watermark
image and writes out a new MP4 video overlaying the watermark image on each frame of the visual. New
MP4 video captures the OpenHub,SourceForge,GitHub and GitLab NeuronRain repository profiles of Krishna iResearch Free Open Source Software initiative of the author having both images and text (testlogs/Krishna_iResearch_NeuronRain_Repositories-2020-07-10_13.17.20.mp4). Function watermark() in DigitalWatermarking.py reads each frame of the video and watermark image in BGRA 4-channel mode (Blue-Green-Red-Alpha). Alpha channel controls the opacity of each pixel.An overlay ndarray is created of the same dimension as each frame of the video. Pixels of overlay array are filled by watermark image. OpenCV addWeighted() function computes a weighted sum of each pixel of watermark and frame images in BGRA 4-color channel - opacity of watermark is controlled by weights. This example watermarks first 2 frames of the video by a Sanskrit name text image (in testlogs/). Alternatively, Image text could be a handwritten signature. Previous watermark is quite primitive and overlay array could be filled by an arbitrary complex pixel cryptographic hash checksum function prior to addWeighted() invocation. Such a steganographic information hiding finds applications in Copyright Protection, Licensing violations, Software Piracy, Currency watermarking, Fraud and Tamper protection, Antitheft Cybercrime software inter alia.

(THEORY and FEATURE) 1 August 2020 - Number crunching - Sublogarithmic Prime power encoding of huge integers by Computational Geometric Factorization and 2060 bits integer factorization quadcore benchmark - related to 2 and all sections on Text Compression and Compressed Sensing, Factorization and its applications, Multiplicative Integer Partitions of NeuronRain Theory Drafts
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is often necessary to store numeric bigdata succinctly - Numeric compression vis-a-vis Text Compression. Usual binary storage requires logN bits. From Unique Factorization Theorem every integer can be expressed uniquely as product of powers of consecutive primes. Number of prime factors of an integer N is kloglogN by Hardy-Ramanujan theorem. Thus huge integers could be stored as concatenated strings of exponents of consecutive primes (primes are implicit and prior factorization is assumed). Identifying the powers of prime factors is the multiplicative partition problem and sum of prime powers in unique factorization is defined by Big Omega. Thus storing the powers of prime factors (partition of Big Omega - all possible huge integers could be generated by partition function of Big Omega) and prime factors could be efficient (sublogarithmic space) compared to storing a huge integer N by logN bits if following holds:
	Average length (bits) of each prime exponent in Big Omega of multiplicative partition = l1
	Average length (bits) of each prime in multiplicative partition = l2
	Total number of bits required to store huge integer = (l1 + l2) * kloglogN
	if (l1 +l2) * kloglogN < logN, prime exponent encoding of integers is sublogarithmic:
		=> (l1 + l2) < logN / kloglogN
		=> For integers of low prime factors (Little Omega) prime exponent encoding is quite
		feasible because of high upperbound for l1 + l2 

Code example code/Spark_PrimePowersEncoding.py invokes the Computational geometric PRAM-NC-BSP factorization for 2060 bits integer (99333539509987274314748077777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777761444238267790503463029217) implemented in NeuronRain by subprocess Python feature on quadcore + Python 3.7.5 and factors are persisted to a JSON list as under (only few small and large factors have been found including non-prime factors).

NC-PRAM-BSP 2063 bits integer factorization - Euclidean Semiprimes - 11 August 2020, 16 August 2020
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spark_PrimePowersEncoding.py has been updated to parse the JSON factors file written by DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized.py after renaming ./DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized.factors to Spark_PrimePowersEncoding.factors in subprocess.call("mv"). Factors are parsed from JSON and their bits length are printed. Small semiprime integer 6541 of 13 bits has been factorized and the length of factors 211 and 31 are printed (code/testlogs/Spark_PrimePowersEncoding.log2.11August2020). Euclid's algorithm has been applied to create semiprime integer 6541 - by multiplying consecutive primes and incrementing by 1:
	(2*3*5 + 1) * (2*3*5*7 + 1) = 31 * 211 = 6541

In previous example sum of lengths of prime factors (12.675295499) is slightly exceeded by length of integer (12.67529549909406):
Length of integer -  6541  - factorized (bits): 12.67529549909406
=======================================
Length of factor -  1  (bits): 0.0
Length of factor -  211  (bits): 7.721099188707186
Length of factor -  6541  (bits): 12.67529549909406
Length of factor -  31  (bits): 4.954196310386876

Similarly huge semiprimes could be found and the encoding is independent of radix (Numeric compression is valid for any log N to base M M-ary representation for M >= 2 because prime factors and their exponents can be encoded in base M - compression ratio remains same).

*) 60466196 = 2^10*3^10 = 6^10 is 26 bits integer while unique prime factor encoding (2,10)(3,10) requires only 2 + 4 + 2 + 4 = 12 bits (space for ordered pair parenthesization is an additional kloglogN which has been neglected). If each parenthesis is of 3 bits for "(","," and ")" delimiters, total space increases to 12 + 3 + 3 = 18 bits in unique factor scheme but still less than 26.
*) CPU instruction set microcodes might have to compute exponentiation and products of prime exponents which increases per instruction time in spite of compressed space.

1129. (THEORY and FEATURE) People Analytics - Feasibility of Automated Talent Recruitment - Fame Versus
Merit - Some Examples - related to 365,420,443,572,613,632,753,1128 and all sections on People Analytics, Fame, Intrinsic Merit, Majority Voting, Sybils, Social Network Analytics, Interview LTF/PTF, BKS Conjecture, Learning LTFs - 28 December 2020
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From literature cited in the references (1129.1) on Fame versus Merit, there is an empirical and statistical evidence of Fame being exponentially related to Merit:
 	" ... Fame, F, grows exponentially with achievement, F(A) = exp(β × A),..."
and achievement is equivalent to intrinsic merit (e.g acdemic publications). Fame is modelled as memepool which evolves over time (Diffusion of Opinion in Social Networks) according to differential equation d(Fame)/dt = v(Achievement). Resemblance of this DE to Recursive Mistake Correction Tree model of Experiential Learning is uncanny.

Section 1128 defines and implements a weighted state machine model of career transition - every human is non-deterministic indefinite state machine defined by choices made (Legendary "Road not taken"). Following example usecases motivate the necessity for automated objective recruitment of talent vis-a-vis subjective majority voting based choice of cadidates in People Analytics (Assumption: Each voter/interviewer uses an Interview LTF which is both subjective and objective multiple choice questionnaire of n questions denoted by q(i) and weighted by w(i) - q1*w1 + q2*w2 + ... + qn*wn):

Example 1:
----------
If intrinsic merit of a candidate is m and there are k voters deciding the candidature (perceived merit
or Fame), for each vote being denoted by v(i):
	m < v(1) < v(2) < ... < v(k)
from assumption - "Intrinsic Merit Lowerbounds Fame in the absence of Sybils" - derived from statistical evidence of exponential separation between the two. v(1) is the least upperbound Fame for Merit m implying every voter overrates candidate (Interview LTF succeeds for candidate). 

Example 2:
---------
If intrinsic merit upperbounds Fame:
	v(1) < v(2) < ... < v(k) < m
implying every voter underrates candidate (Interview LTF fails for candidate)

Example 3:
---------
If intrinsic merit is an average (weighted mean) of Fame:
	v1 < v2 < ... < vx < m < vy < ... < vk
implying some voters underrate while others overrate candidate. This is the most prevalent scenario in
real world setting (Interview LTF neither fails nor succeeds for candidate)

Of these, Example usecase1 is supported by statistical evidence. Example1 and Example2 are consensual but yet inaccurate. Previous scenarios demonstrate error probability of real world manual Interview processes which are a mixture of Majority Voting and LTF, thus semi-intrinsic. Replacing manual interviews by objective LTF which is dynamically machine learnt from People profile datasets (e.g Career Transition Automaton, Source Lines of Code for IT domain) minimizes errors and is more absolute. From Computational Learning Theory, LTFs can be learnt in polynomial time in the presence of classification noise.

Career Polynomials - Inner Product Spaces - Example 4:
-----------------------------------------------------
Career Transition of a profile could be plotted as points on polynomials and similarity of two profiles p and q could be ascertained by inner product spaces of interpolated career polynomials defined as:
	<p, q> = p(t0)q(t0) + p(t1)q(t1) + · · · + p(tn)q(tn)
where p(ti) and q(ti) are the values (e.g remuneration) of polynomials at time ti. Usual algebraic notations of orthonormal basis apply and p,q are orthogonal if <p,q> is 0 (Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization). For two profiles making  extremely different career choices <p,q> reaches its infimum - Example:
	p(0) = 0, p(1) = 100000, p(2) = 0, p(3) = 100000
	q(0) = 100000, q(1) = 0, q(2) = 100000, q(3) = 0
	<p,q> = 0 (Orthogonal) implying profiles p and q made diametrically opposite career choices during similar time points.

1.Transformer attention models are recent deep learning advances in NLP replacing Recurrent NNs and LSTMs and are widely used in machine translation and text analytics. BERT and GPT based text writing systems have massive pretrained transformers underneath.
2.Transformer attention model learns Query weights (Q), Key weights (K), Value weights (V) for embedding xi for word i defined by:
	Qi = xi * qi
	Ki = xi * ki
	Vi = xi * vi
	Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(Q * K^T/sqrt(d^k))*V, d^k = dimension of Keys vector
	a(i,j) = attention of word i to word j = qi * kj
	softmax(xi) = e^xi/Sigma(e^xj) which normalizes sum to 1
3.Weights are learnt by Gradient Descent Perceptron code for which has been implemented in Transformers_PerceptronAndGradient.py (invoked by Transformers.py) which is based on PerceptronAndGradient.py in NeuronRain AstroInfer but replicated for Transformer specific enhancements.
4.This commit implements transformer model in Transformers.py and Transformers_PerceptronAndGradient.py which are invoked from Spark_Word2vec.py for learning previous attention weights for word2vec embeddings of academic publications.

Bocherds Teapot Shards experiment for predicting number of shards teapot would break into has uncanny similarities to Randomized NC Parallel Space Filling of many natural random parallel processes (Rain drops falling at random in parallel, Distribution of randomly strewn sand particles,...). Teapot shards which are randomly created in parallel are of unequal sizes and fill a rectangular space. NeuronRain Randomized NC Cellular automaton parallel PRG space filling algorithm assumes equal sized circles of infinitesimal radii sweeping the 2D plane which is an alternative formulation of Circle Packing Problem. Filling a 2D space at randomly chosen ordinates (which are centroids of circles of small radii) requires classical parallel PRGs (Tygar-Reif,Applebaum Linear strech PRG in NC). Teapot shards are fragmented at unequal random shapes and predicting number of shards by Quantum computation is equivalent to predicting total number of randomly chosen ordinate points in Classical Parallel PRG Cellular Automaton Grid filling version e.g finding total number of rain drops - rainfall is a massive natural parallel random computation deserving a quantum supremacy analogue and a quantum PRG might be suitable for simulating rain - if randomly chosen ordinate centroids are random variables set to 1 from 0 implying a filling, sampled average of sum of binary random variables converges to expected value (mean) by Central Limit Theorem.

At one point, Borcherds argues that sampling-based quantum supremacy itself fails his teapot test. For consider the computational problem of predicting how many pieces a teapot will break into if it’s dropped on the ground. Clearly, he says, the teapot itself will outperform any simulation running on any existing classical computer at that task, and will therefore achieve “teapot supremacy.”..."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DigitalWatermarking.py implementation has been refactored to define 2 separate watermarking functions for Videos and Images which thus far
had definition only for Video files (watermark_video and watermark_image). Few example group photo image files (Copyright: 95CSE PSG Tech, 
Coimbatore) of author (.jpg and .png) have been watermarked by Python 3.7.5 + OpenCV2 overlay(). Digital watermarking overlay is a primitive
image classifier - overlay of similar segmented images causes high number of superimposed image segments (or) facegraphs of similar 
segmented images are more isomorphic and high number face vertices of overlayed images get superimposed exactly. Vertices of Facegraphs of the overlayed segmented images are stacked creating a multiplanar graph (in which every vertex is a stack) which is a visual version of ThoughtNet if thoughts are visualized.

Collatz conjecture states:
	x(n+1) = x(n)/2 if x(n) is even and 3x(n) + 1 if x(n) is odd and {x(n)} sequence always ends in 1.

Collatz map is a chaotic fractal which exhibits pseudorandomness and generalized Collatz conjecture (g(n) = a(i)*n+b(i), n=i mod P for rational a(i) and b(i) and g(n) is integer) is undecidable. NeuronRain implements a Chaotic PRG based on conventional actuarial and fractal logistic maps (Verhulste-Pearl-Reed and Mandelbrot). Collatz conjecture could be useful for modelling Economic Event Timeseries as Graphical Event Model E.g stock price quote tickers alternately demonstrate ebb and tide which are explained by Chaotic Mandelbrot sets (Multifractals - https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/multifractals-explain-wall-street/). Collatz sequence is complementarily 2-colored by odd and even integers determined by rule earlier. Collatz conjecture for economic datasets (quarterly GDP data of Boom-Recession, Demand driven-Supply driven) is a plausible usage for Graphical Event Models by following hypothetical rephrasal:
	x(n+1) = Boom/2 (Recession), if x(n) = Boom (simulates penalty for supply glut after boom)
	and 
	3*Recession + 1 (Boom) if x(n) = Recession (simulates incentive for demand growth after recession)
Stock prices are influenced by global cues and sectorwise stocks fall or rise according to ripple effect of global events making stream of stock quotes an event timeseries for Graphical Event Model. Boom is tentatively defined as > 7% GDP growth QoQ while Recession is defined as < 2% GDP growth over two consecutive quarters. Thus GEM and CEM are heavily related to Chaos and Non-linear dynamics. Basic dictum of market event causality cycle goes by: Boom causes supply glut, supply glut causes low demand and recession, and low supply caused by recession spurs demand which is thus a cyclical CEM and GEM. Multifractal model of stock markets defines stream of multiple local exponents for logistic instead of one exponent. Discrete Fourier Transform of stream of stock quotes could reveal hidden periodicities - For stream q0,q1,q2,...qN:
        X(k) = Sum_n=0_to_N-1(x(n) * e^(2*pi*n*k/N)), k=0,1,2,...,N-1
X(k) are the Fourier spectrum frequencies.

on ThoughtNet Hypergraph Evocation, Evocation WordNet, Contextual Multiarmed Bandit model of ThoughtNet, Reinforcement Learning and Word Sense Disambiguation, Cognitive Psychology
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NeuronRain postulates and implements a Contextual Multiarmed Bandit model of thought evocation named "ThoughtNet" which is a hypergraph of thoughts and every vertex of multiplanar ThoughtNet is a stack. Reinforcement Learning based Contextual Bandit retrieves thought of maximum reward for each evocative. For example, three stack hypervertices c1,c2,c3 of ThoughtNet could be evocatives or modal classes and each hypervertex stack is populated by thoughts t1,t2,t3,...,tn. Hypergraph nature of ThoughtNet allows a thought hyperedge to connect multiple hypervertices of ThoughtNet. Evocation problem is to uniquely determine a hyperedge on utterances of evocatives c1,c2 and c3. As opposed to contextual multi armed bandit solution which ranks thoughts evoked by numeric rewards and chooses the maximum, unique thought could be retrieved non-numerically if intersection of sets of hypervertices has size 1. Any intersection of size > 1 would neccessitate disambiguation - Example:
	c1 - {t1,t3,t7}
	c2 - {t1,t2,t5,t6}
	c3 - {t1,t3,t4,t5}
For previous ThoughtNet hypergraph of three hypervertices c1,c2,c3 and hyperedges t1,t2,t3,t4,t5,t6,t7, evocatives c1,c2,c3 uniquely determine {t1} by intersection while evocatives c1,c3 retrieve thoughts {t1,t3} which have to be ranked. Datastructure used for intersection (e.g type of hashing) is crucial.

Graph Theory was born from Euler's analysis of Konigsberg Bridge problem which is an urban transportation feasibility question answered by
Eulerian circuits - graphs of even degree vertices and edges belonging to single component - whether people can traverse closed trail of all bridges in city of Konigsberg. Minimum spanning tree (least cost tree of a graph spanning all vertices), Vertex cover (subset of vertices on which atleast one endpoint of every edge is incident), Edge cover (subset of edges on which every vertex is incident) and Eulerian Circuit (graphs of even degree vertices and edges belonging to single component) of Segmented Urban Sprawl GIS Facegraph and Transportation graph are theoretical tools which are useful in planning optimal transportation of an urban sprawl - Every traffic intersection of urban transportation network is a vertex and connecting roads are edges. Vertex cover highlights all important intersections while edge cover is the set of all important roads. Minimum spanning tree is the least cost subset of roads between any intersection. Dense subgraphs or cores of transportation network are congested clusters of activities. Strongly connected components of transportation network are usually blockade-free. Typically an urban or metropolitan agglomeration is defined as a circle of radius which includes all localities served by suburban public transport (metro, rail or road) connectivity to central business district of the city - by people who commute to work daily. Aforementioned graph theoretic gists of urban transportation graph or facegraph facilitate efficient drone GPS navigation for myriad automatic delivery of services. Urban transportation network is a directed, multiplanar (as intersections might be flyovers or grade separators), multigraph (because of multiple lanes between intersections) or could as well be a hypergraph because carriageways connect multiple vertices (intersections). Air quality index is a pollution measure which is directly proportional to urbanisation and industrialization and optimally spaced-out residential,commercial,manufacturing-IT-ITES and Greenery by Four-color theorem multiple agent resource allocation disperses particulate matter.
