I am at present working on R&D of my nonprofit opensource initiative products and independently pursuing academic research

My detailed CV herewith and in my website (https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/) has details on:

	(*) Parallel opensource initiative products which I have been working on from 2003-present independently (http://sourceforge.net/users/ka_shrinivaasan and https://github.com/shrinivaasanka) - at present this is not-for-profit initiative and is not a commercial startup yet- It is not funded by anyone, I do not have a team and it is not a company. Premium technical support is available for above opensource codebases. The GitHub repositories implement NeuronRain Enterprise and SourceForge repositories implement NeuronRain Research versions. Opensource products in http://sourceforge.net/users/ka_shrinivaasan and https://github.com/shrinivaasanka are being architected and developed individually by myself as subsystems of a new Cloud,Machine Learning, Queue augmented Linux Kernel Variant derived from Linux Kernel Mainline - named NeuronRain - and licensed under GPLv3 copyleft license - people who download and derive from it (commercial or otherwise) should also opensource the derived products.  A professional closedsource product with lot of enhancements over the opensource codebase is also in the works.
	
        (*) My academic publications till 2011 and self-researched draft publications thereafter from 2012-present - https://sourceforge.net/projects/acadpdrafts/ - I had to break from PhD research at CMI due to inevitable personal reasons in August 2011 and went back to industry. At present I am not enrolled in PhD officially anywhere and only pursuing independent research on my own.
	
        (*) Research and Development works including consultancy done for various organisations from 1999-present
