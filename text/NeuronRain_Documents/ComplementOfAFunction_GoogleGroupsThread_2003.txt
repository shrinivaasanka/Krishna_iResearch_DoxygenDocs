Hi all,


Is there a way to find a complement of a function defined on
integers(Both domain and range are integers)?

What I mean is :
Suppose you have a set of positive integers = {1,2,3,4,5....}
Let us say we create a subset of even integers out of it =
{2,4,6,8,....}
This set of even numbers can be generated by using the function f(x) =
2x, x=1,2,3...
The complement of this set is set of odd numbers and they can be
generated using g(x) = 2x-1 , x=1,2,3,4,....
So I define g(x)=2x-1 to be the complement function of f(x)=2x over
the set of integers.

Is there a generic way to arrive at the complement function given
an arbitrary integer function? (I think we can do it using Taylor
series. But seems more mechanical)


thanks and regards,
K.Srinivasan

generating functions? 1/(1-z) - f(z)
the function has to be strictly increasing and the gf is really a
characteristic function (all coeffs are 0 or 1)

e.g. 2n <=> 1/(1-x^2), not 2/(1-x)^2

Note: g(x) is *a* complement function. h(x)=2x+1 is also a complement
of f(x). Finding such a function may be non-trivial. Don't know if
that helps or not.

That's a way to use power series to obtain the complement of
a set. It doesn't give the "complement function". (Given a function
f with _range_ a subset of f we want another function g with
range equal to the complement of the range of f...)

Hmmm... then just extract the function from this characteristic function?

2n <=> 1/(1-x^2)
<complement> 1/(1-x) - 1/(1-x^2)
= x/(1-x^2)
<=> 2n-1
(not really a generating function coeff extraction but easy to see anyway)

Yes, this last step is not particularly tractable for anything other
than combinations of linear functions. (I think quadratic functions have
a basis using theta functions)

Do you see another way for the original problem?

The complement will not, in general, be uniquely determined. For
instance, if we use the whole set of integers and select the ones
generated by f(n) = 2n, every function of the form g(n) = 2n - (2m +
1) is going to be a complement to f(n) for all integers m. With more
complicated sets, even your generating function is not going to be
uniquely determined. The problem is that you're going to begin with a
set. Either you already know a generating function, or you'll be hard
pressed to find one, since you'll have to know all terms of the
sequence without knowing a generating function to give them to you.

The best you can do, if you want a unique answer, is to give the set
and its complement without speaking of functions.

Seems to me this is more of a "theory of computability" issue than
anything. For the given example, the OP essentially gave us a program
for churning out a particular set of integers/naturals, and then gave
us a program that churns out the complement of the first set. Of
course there will in general be many programs to churn out the
complement, if there are any at all.

Among other things, if the original set (eg of evens, as per the OP)
isn't recursive, then that's a good time to give up on a "complement
program"....

Generally speaking, the notions of "recursive set", "recursively
enumerable set", and the like seem quite relevant to the OP's
question...

As another poster has pointed out, g will not be unique in general. A
more serious problem is that even if f is computable then it doesn't
follow that any computable g would work. The range of a computable
function from integers to integers is by definition recursively
enumerable and it is a standard result that the complement of an r.e.
set need not be r.e.

Hope this helps

If we restrict ourselves to functions from the positive integers into
the positive integers and we take g to be an
increasing function, then g is unique. If I calculated correctly, g
would satisfy the equation g(f(x)-x) = f(x)-1. Of
course this may not be of much use to actually compute g.

I don't see what Taylor series could have to do with this.

This is wrong: e.g. if f(1)=1, f(2)=3, f(3)=4 then g(f(3)-3)=g(1)=2 but
f(3)-1=3.

>course this may not be of much use to actually compute g.

I think you're also assuming f(x) is increasing. If we do that, then
g is computable, e.g. g(x) = min {w >= x: f(w+1-x) > w}. (Of course,
if g(x) doesn't exist, i.e. f misses fewer than x values, a search
for such w would never terminate, and there is no way in general
to predict this)

"Extracting" a function whose _values_ are the indices where the
generating function has a non-zero coefficient is exactly equivalent
to the original problem.

No, it seems to me like the sort of problem that one should
simply not expect a simple answer to.

Yes, I posted this a little too quickly. I had in mind a function f whose
values at consecutive integers are not consecutive; that is, f(n) < f(n+1) -
1 for each n>0. For example, if f(x) = 3x, then we get g(2x) = 3x-1. Since
x must be a positive integer, this equation doesn't tell us what g of an odd
number is, but we can get an idea of how fast g grows.

Yes, I assumed that f is increasing. I interpreted the original poster's
question as to how one would break the sequence of positive integers
into two
disjoint subsequences. One of these subsequences would be given by
{f(n)}, the
other by what he called the complement of f, {g(n)}.

Good point. This leads to the issue of whether g can be constructed.
That would depend on f.

I agree with "exactly", but I think differently than your intention. I
think the generating function method puts the question on a basis in
which objects can be manipulated formally. I don't think I've just
reworded the problem. Some of the steps may be intractable (or even
currently unknown how to implement), but

To give a better example (one that is tractable), suppose you have the
function f(n) = 3n. It is easy to see intuitively that the the
complement of the range is the set of numbers that are not congruent to
0 mod 3. But what is the -function- g(x) whose range is this set (i.e.
g(0) = 1, g(1) = 2, g(2) = 4, g(3) = 5, g(4) = 7, etc...). How do you
construct that function given just f? (Sure we have notation that we can
use to immediately solve it intuitively:

"if x = 0 mod 2, g(x) = 3x/2 + 1,
if x = 1 mod 2, g(x) = 3(x-1)/2 + 2"

but by the method I gave eventually you compute for the complement the
generating function (x+x^2)/(1-x^3) (from which of course one can
formally extract the above)

the missing hard part is converting from a gf (a monotonically
increasing one) to the gf of the characteristic function (and back).
I don't see how to do it for anything other than f having a range the
union of linear functions.
