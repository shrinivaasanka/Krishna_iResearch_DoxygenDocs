1244. Following are NeuronRain Usecases (some of which have been implemented in NeuronRain while others have dependencies):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.Software Analytics - Scheduler Analytics - Psutil Deep Learning of Scheduler Classes and writing to /etc/kernel_analytics.conf or /etc/sysctl.conf (kernel.sched.*)
2.Software Analytics - Software Analytics - Psutil Deep Learning of Systemwide Memory/IO/CPU load.
3.Software Analytics - Userspace and Kernelspace Program Analyzers
4.Software Analytics - Kernel Analytics - Analysis of kernel logs
5.Software Analytics - Wireless Network Traffic Analytics
6.Drones/Unmanned Aerial Vehicles - Deep Learning of GIS imagery by Video ImageNet-EventNet Tensor Products Algorithm for prominent features (convex hulls, bounding boxes etc.,) in terrestrial images and navigation accordingly - Drone Online Shopping Delivery example
7.Drones/Unmanned Aerial Vehicles - Kernel Analytics for Drone and Robotic OSes (https://github.com/Dronecode,https://github.com/Dronecode/DronecodeSDK,https://github.com/Dronecode/DronecodeSDK-Python) - Drone Online Shopping Delivery example
8.Streaming Analytics - Streams from various datasources
9.Advertisement Analytics - by Spark Structured Streaming, PageRank
10.Merit ranking and Analytics of Text,Audio/Music,Video,People
11.Histogram-Set Partition Analytics - Streams of business intelligence histograms, voting histograms, hashtables or dictionaries
12.Medical Imageing Analytics - find patterns in ECG,MRI,Scan medical images for diagnosis
13.Image Analytics - Webcam or retinal scan driver captures face or retinal scan image,compares them for match (face or retinal scan as password) in userspace deep learning analytics, exports match = True or False as kernel analytics variables which are read and exported by kernel_analytics VIRGO32 and VIRGO64 drivers and read by some other authentication driver in kernel and message is logged in /var/log/kern.log
14.Drones/Flights/UAVs - Change pxrc flight controller driver for reading analytics variables exported by kernel_analytics VIRGO32 and VIRGO64 drivers
15.Astronomy analytics - Sequence Mining and N-Body equation solver for gravitational acceleration-extreme weather events correlation,Space imagery analysis
