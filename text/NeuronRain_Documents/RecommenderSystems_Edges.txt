["Computing semantic relatedness using Wikipedia-based explicit semantic analysis.  E Gabrilovich, S Markovitch - IJcAI, 2007 - aaai.org Abstract Computing semantic relatedness of natural language texts requires access to vast amounts of common-sense and domain-specific world knowledge. We propose Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA), a novel method that represents the meaning of texts in a high- Cited by 1772 Related articles All 26 versions Cite Save More", "Evaluating wordnet-based measures of lexical semantic relatedness A Budanitsky, G Hirst - Computational Linguistics, 2006 - dl.acm.org Abstract The quantification of lexical semantic relatedness has many applications in NLP, and many different measures have been proposed. We evaluate five of these measures, all of which use WordNet as their central resource, by comparing their performance in detecting Cited by 1429 Related articles All 70 versions Cite Save", "WikiRelate Computing semantic relatedness using Wikipedia M Strube, SP Ponzetto - AAAI, 2006 - aaai.org Abstract Wikipedia provides a knowledge base for computing word relatedness in a more structured fashion than a search engine and with more coverage than WordNet.
