In this research, we have studied the applicability of the Collatz Conjecture to pseudo-random number generators (PRNG). The research was motivated by the simplicity of the Collatz function, which makes it attractive as a potential PRNG. We have experimented with several candidate PRNGs based on the trajectory property of the Collatz function and the Collatz graph. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithms are the first to successfully utilize properties of the Collatz function to generate random numbers. Additionally, we have proved that one of our PRNGs generates uniformly distributed output with a period of 2³². Finally, we have found that two of our PRNGs perform on par with the Mersenne Twister algorithm. Because our algorithms pass the NIST Test Suite, they are suitable for usage in certain cryptographic applications as well as simulations. The Collatz conjecture is an unsolved conjecture in mathematics. It is named after Lothar Collatz, who first proposed it in 1937. The conjecture is also known as the 3n + 1 conjecture, the Ulam conjecture (after Stanislaw Ulam), the Syracuse problem, as the hailstone sequence or hailstone numbers, or as Wondrous numbers per Gödel, Escher, Bach.  It asks whether a certain kind of number sequence always ends in the same way, regardless of the starting number.
