[users@httpd] problem with subprocess_env

Hi,

My module has two phases: 1) name translation 2) request handling.
In the name translation phase, I store something in the request_rec
structure by adding a name-value pair to subprocess_env table of the
request_rec.
Then I retrieve it in the request handler function using
table_get(r->subprocess_env).
Now the problem I face is that I get the bus error as below and
apache subprocess is crashing. Loading the core into dbx causes dbx
itself to crash. What am I doing wrong?

[Mon Feb 17 15:14:33 2003] [notice] child pid 2434 exit signal Bus Error
(10)
(NOTE: I also tried adding to request_rec->notes and
request_rec->request_config but the result was same)
thanks,
