[apache-modules] Urgent: Apache 1.3.27 question on absolute URI

Dear all,

How do I get the absolute URI (scheme://host:port ...) of the request in
apache 1.3.27 ? Is there an API for it ?
Infact my problem is as below:
I have a module which I have built for apache 1.3.27 . I want to use the
same module without recompilation in apache-1.3.27 + mod_ssl. The
problem comes here. I am using ap_http_method() to get the scheme of the
request to distinguish secure and non-secure requests. But
ap_http_method is a macro which is defined differently for EAPI using
#ifdef. This creates the problem when I use the module as-is , without
rebuilding, in apache+mod_ssl. All I need is a way to get the scheme of
the request or atleast a way to get absolute URI so that I can do
strncmp().
thanks in advance
K.Srinivasan
